<b>I.  Background and Summary of Provisions </b><br/>
A.  Purpose<b> </b><br/>
 <br/>
This proposed rule is the first phase of proposed policies centrally focused on advancing <br/>
interoperability and patient access to health information using the authority available to the <br/>
Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). We believe this is an important step in <br/>
advancing interoperability, putting patients at the center of their health care and ensuring they <br/>
have access to their health information. We are committed to solving the issue of interoperability <br/>
and achieving complete access to health information for patients in the United States (U.S.) <br/>
health care system, and are taking an active approach to move participants in the health care <br/>
market toward interoperability and the secure and timely exchange of health information by <br/>
proposing and adopting policies for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the Children’s Health <br/>
Insurance Program (CHIP), and issuers of qualified health plans (QHPs).  <br/>
Throughout this proposed rule, we refer to terms such as patient, consumer, beneficiary, <br/>
enrollee, and individual. We note that every reader of this proposed rule is a patient and has or <br/>
will receive medical care at some point in their life. In this proposed rule, we use the term <br/>
“patient” as an inclusive term, but because we have historically referred to patients using other <br/>
terms in our regulations, we use specific terms as applicable in sections of this proposed rule to <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>5</b>  <br/>
refer to individuals covered under the health care programs that CMS administers and regulates. <br/>
We also use terms such as payer, plan, and issuer in this proposed rule. Certain portions of this <br/>
proposed rule are applicable to the Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) Program, the Medicaid FFS <br/>
Program, the CHIP FFS program, Medicare Advantage (MA) Organizations, Medicaid Managed <br/>
Care plans (managed care organizations (MCOs), prepaid inpatient health plans (PIHPs) and <br/>
prepaid ambulatory health plans (PAHPs)), CHIP Managed Care entities (MCOs, PIHPs, and <br/>
PAHPs), and QHP issuers in Federally-facilitated Exchanges (FFEs). We use the term “payer” as <br/>
an inclusive term, but we use specific terms as applicable in sections of this proposed rule. <br/>
B. Overview <br/>
We are dedicated to enhancing and protecting the health and well-being of all<b> </b>Americans. <br/>
One critical issue in the U.S. health care system is that people cannot easily access their complete <br/>
health information in interoperable forms. Patients and the health care providers caring for them <br/>
are often presented with an incomplete picture of their health and care as pieces of their <br/>
information are stored in various, unconnected systems and do not accompany the patient to <br/>
every care setting.  <br/>
 <br/>
We believe patients should have the ability to move from health plan to health plan, <br/>
provider to provider, and have both their clinical and administrative information travel with them <br/>
throughout their journey. When a patient receives care from a new provider, a complete record of <br/>
their health information should be readily available to that care provider, regardless of where or <br/>
by who care was previously provided. When a patient is discharged from a hospital to a post-<br/>
acute care (PAC) setting there should be no question as to how, when, or where their data will be <br/>
exchanged. Likewise, when an enrollee changes health plans or ages into Medicare, the enrollee <br/>
should be able to have their claims history and encounter data follow so that information is not <br/>
lost.<b> </b><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>6</b>  <br/>
 <br/>
For providers in clinical settings, health information technology (health IT) should be a <br/>
resource, designed to make it faster and easier for providers to deliver high quality care, creating <br/>
efficiencies and allowing them to access all available data for their patients. Health IT should not <br/>
detract from the clinician-patient relationship, from the patient’s experience of care, or from the <br/>
quality of work life for physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals. Through <br/>
standards-based interoperability and exchange, health IT has the potential to be a resource and <br/>
facilitator for efficient, safe, high-quality care for individuals and populations. <br/>
 <br/>
All payers, including health plans, should have the ability to exchange data seamlessly <br/>
with other payers for timely benefits coordination or transitions, and with providers to facilitate <br/>
more coordinated and efficient care. Health plans are in a unique position to provide enrollees a <br/>
complete picture of their claims and encounter data, allowing patients to piece together their own <br/>
information that might otherwise be lost in disparate systems. This information can contribute to <br/>
better informed decision making, helping to inform the patient’s choice of coverage options and <br/>
care providers to more effectively manage their own health, care, and costs.  <br/>
 <br/>
We are committed to solving the issue of interoperability and patient access in the U.S. <br/>
health care system while reducing administrative burdens on providers and are taking an active <br/>
approach using all available policy levers and authorities to move participants in the health care <br/>
market toward interoperability and the secure and timely exchange of health care information.  <br/>
C.  Executive Order and MyHealthEData <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
On October 12, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13813 to Promote <br/>
Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States. Section 1(c)(iii) of Executive <br/>
Order 13813 states that the Administration will improve access to, and the quality of, <br/>
information that Americans need to make informed health care decisions, including information <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=7></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>7</b>  <br/>
about health care prices and outcomes, while minimizing reporting burdens on affected plans, <br/>
providers, and payers.<b> </b><br/>
 <br/>
In support of Executive Order 13813, the Administration launched the MyHealthEData <br/>
initiative. This government-wide initiative aims to empower patients by ensuring that they have <br/>
full access to their own health information and the ability to decide how their data will be used, <br/>
while keeping that information safe and secure. MyHealthEData aims to break down the barriers <br/>
that prevent patients from gaining electronic access to their health information from the device or <br/>
application of their choice, empowering patients and taking a critical step toward interoperability <br/>
and patient data exchange.<b> </b><br/>
 <br/>
In March 2018, the White House Office of American Innovation and the CMS <br/>
Administrator announced the launch of MyHealthEData, and CMS’s direct, hands-on role in <br/>
improving patient access and advancing interoperability. As part of the MyHealthEData <br/>
initiative, we are taking a patient-centered approach to health information access and moving to a <br/>
system in which patients have immediate access to their computable health information and can <br/>
be assured that their health information will follow them as they move throughout the health care <br/>
system from provider to provider, payer to payer. To accomplish this, we have launched several <br/>
initiatives related to data sharing and interoperability to empower patients and encourage plan <br/>
and provider competition. In this proposed rule, we continue to advance the policies and goals of <br/>
the MyHealthEData initiative through various proposals as outlined in the following sections.<b> </b><br/>
 <br/>
Our proposals are wide-reaching and would have an impact on all facets of the health <br/>
care system. Several key touch points of the proposals in this rule include:  <br/>
<b>●  </b><i>Patients</i>: Enabling patients to access their health information electronically without <br/>
special effort by requiring the payers subject to this proposed rule to make the data available <br/>
through an application programming interface (API) to which third party software applications <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=8></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>8</b>  <br/>
connect to make the data available to patients. This encourages them to take charge of and better <br/>
manage their health care, and thus these initiatives are imperative to improving a patient’s long-<br/>
term health outcomes. <br/>
●  <i>Clinicians and Hospitals</i>: Ensuring that health care providers have ready access to <br/>
health information about their patients, regardless of where the patient may have previously <br/>
received care. We are also proposing policies to prevent health care providers from <br/>
inappropriately restricting the flow of information to other health care providers and payers.<b> </b><br/>
Finally, we are working to ensure that better interoperability reduces the burden on health care <br/>
providers.<b> </b><br/>
●  <i>Payers</i>: Proposing requirements to ensure that payers (that is, entities and <br/>
organizations that pay for health care), such as MA plans and Medicaid and CHIP programs, <br/>
make enrollee electronic health information held by the plan available through an API such that, <br/>
with use of software we expect payers and third parties to develop, the information becomes <br/>
easily accessible to the enrollee, and that the data flows seamlessly with the enrollee as they <br/>
change providers, plans, and issuers. Additionally, our proposals would ensure that payers make <br/>
it easy for current and prospective enrollees to identify which providers are within a given plan’s <br/>
network in a way that is simple and easy for enrollees to access and understand, and thus find the <br/>
providers that are right for them.  <b> </b><br/>
 <br/>
Under our proposals to standardize data and technical approaches to advance <br/>
interoperability, we believe health care providers and their patients, as well as other key <br/>
participants within the health care ecosystem such as plans and payers, will have appropriate <br/>
access to the information necessary to coordinate individual care, analyze population health <br/>
trends, outcomes, and costs, and manage benefits and the health of populations, while tracking <br/>
progress through quality improvement initiatives.<b> </b>We are working with other federal partners <br/>

including the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) on <br/>
this effort with the clear objective to improve patient access and care, alleviate provider burden, <br/>
and reduce overall health care costs.<b> </b><br/>
D.  Past Efforts<b> </b><br/>
 <br/>
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been working to advance the <br/>
interoperability of electronic health information since 2004, when the ONC was initially created <br/>
via Executive Order 13335. From 2004 to 2009, ONC worked with a variety of federal and <br/>
private sector stakeholders to coordinate private and public actions, began harmonizing data <br/>
standards, and worked to advance nationwide health information exchange. In 2009, the National <br/>
Coordinator position, office, and statutory duties were codified by the Health Information <br/>
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), enacted as part of the <br/>
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5, enacted February 17, 2009), <br/>
at Title 42—Health Information Technology and Quality (42 U.S.C. 300jj <i>et seq.</i>) of the Public <br/>
Health Service Act (PHSA). Under section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA, ONC established a <br/>
voluntary certification program to certify that health IT met standards, implementation <br/>
specifications, and certification criteria adopted by the Secretary. ONC is organizationally <br/>
located within HHS’ Office of the Secretary and is the principal federal entity charged with <br/>
coordination of nationwide efforts to implement and use the most advanced health IT and the <br/>
electronic exchange of health information.<b> </b><br/>
 <br/>
The HITECH Act provided the opportunity to move interoperability forward in many <br/>
additional meaningful ways. A few are particularly worth noting in relation to this proposed rule. <br/>
For instance, HITECH also amended the Social Security Act (the Act), authorizing CMS to make <br/>
incentive payments (and in later years, make downward adjustments to Medicare payments) to <br/>
eligible professionals, eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs), and MA <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=10></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>10</b>  <br/>
organizations to promote the adoption and meaningful use of certified electronic health record <br/>
technology (CEHRT). In 2010, through rulemaking, we established criteria for the Medicare and <br/>
Medicaid Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs to encourage eligible <br/>
professionals, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to adopt, implement, upgrade, and demonstrate the <br/>
meaningful use of CEHRT. The programs were implemented in three stages: <br/>
●  Stage 1 set the foundation for the EHR Incentive Programs by establishing <br/>
requirements for the electronic capture of clinical data, including providing patients with <br/>
electronic copies of health information.  <br/>
●  Stage 2 expanded upon the Stage 1 criteria with a focus on advancing clinical <br/>
processes and ensuring that the meaningful use of EHRs supported the aims and priorities of the <br/>
National Quality Strategy. Stage 2 criteria encouraged the use of CEHRT for continuous quality <br/>
improvement at the point of care and the exchange of information in the most structured format <br/>
possible.  <br/>
●  Stage 3 focuses on using CEHRT to improve health outcomes.<b> </b><br/>
 <br/>
The federal government has spent over $35 billion under the EHR Incentive Programs to <br/>
incentivize the adoption and meaningful use of EHR systems by eligible professionals, eligible <br/>
hospitals, and CAHs; however, despite the fact that 78 percent of physicians<a href="CMSs.html#10">1</a> and 96 percent of <br/>
hospitals<a href="CMSs.html#10">2 </a>now use a certified EHR system, progress on system-wide data sharing has been <br/>
limited.  <br/>
 <br/>
In 2010, under the HITECH Act, ONC adopted an initial set of standards, implementation <br/>
specifications, and certification criteria, and established the Temporary Certification Program for <br/>
                                                           <br/>

Health Information Technology, under which health IT developers could begin to obtain <br/>
certification of the EHR technology that eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, and CAHs <br/>
would need to adopt and use to satisfy CMS Stage 1 requirements for demonstration of <br/>
meaningful use of CEHRT. In January 2011, ONC replaced the Temporary Certification <br/>
Program with the Permanent Certification Program for Health Information Technology (45 CFR <br/>
part 170). The Secretary has adopted iterative editions of the set of standards, implementation <br/>
specifications, and certification criteria included in the Programs to keep pace with advances in <br/>
standards, health information exchange, and the health IT market. In addition, this helps to <br/>
maintain alignment with the needs of health care providers seeking to succeed within health IT-<br/>
linked federal programs. <br/>
<b> </b><br/>
In April 2015, Congress passed the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of <br/>
2015 (MACRA) (Pub. L. 114-10, enacted April 16, 2015), which declared it a national objective <br/>
to achieve widespread exchange of health information through interoperable CEHRT <br/>
nationwide. Section 106(b)(1)(B)(ii) of MACRA defines “interoperability” as the ability of two <br/>
or more health information systems or components to exchange clinical and other information <br/>
and to use the information that has been exchanged using common standards as to provide access <br/>
to longitudinal information for health care providers in order to facilitate coordinated care and <br/>
improved patient outcomes. The MACRA charges the Secretary to establish metrics to be used to <br/>
determine if widespread interoperability had been achieved, and the heading of section 106(b)(2) <br/>
of the MACRA refers to “preventing blocking the sharing of information.” Specifically, section <br/>
106(b)(2) of the MACRA amended section 1848(o)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act for eligible professionals <br/>
and section 1886(n)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act for eligible hospitals and CAHs to require that the <br/>
professional or hospital demonstrate that they have not knowingly and willfully taken action to <br/>
limit or restrict the compatibility or interoperability of CEHRT.  For a discussion of the <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=12></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>12</b>  <br/>
attestation requirements that we established and codified to support the prevention of information <br/>
blocking, we refer readers to the CY 2017 Quality Payment Program final rule (81 FR 77028 <br/>
through 77035). <br/>
 <br/>
In April 2018, we renamed the EHR Incentive Programs and the MIPS Advancing Care <br/>
Information performance category to the Promoting Interoperability (PI) Programs and <br/>
Promoting Interoperability performance category, respectively (83 FR 41635). This refocusing <br/>
and rebranding of the initiatives is just one part of the CMS strategic shift in focus to advancing <br/>
health IT and interoperability. <b> </b><br/>
CMS appreciates the pathways Congress opened for action on interoperability, as will be <br/>
discussed in more detail throughout this proposed rule and has been working diligently with <br/>
ONC to support implementation. In addition, in order to make sure we have as much stakeholder <br/>
feedback on all the options CMS specifically has available to best take advantage of this new <br/>
opportunity to promote interoperability, over a span of several months in 2018, we released <br/>
interoperability Requests for Information (RFIs) in several Medicare payment rules, including in <br/>
the FY 2019 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) proposed rule (83 FR 20164). While <br/>
the Interoperability RFI in the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule was focused primarily on how and <br/>
whether changes to Hospital Conditions of Participation and other like program requirements <br/>
could impact or contribute to advancing interoperability, stakeholders provided additional input <br/>
that we are taking under advisement for the purposes of advancing interoperability generally in <br/>
this proposed rule. For example, some commenters recommended aligning existing standards <br/>
and adopting common standards and/or data elements across the health care industry as a whole <br/>
(not just focusing on providers), incentivizing the use of standards, and removing barriers as <br/>
possible ways to address gaps in interoperability. Commenters also expressed support for the use <br/>
of open APIs but cautioned CMS to consider the need to ensure health information security. <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=13></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>13</b>  <br/>
Support was also expressed for enhancing applications that are designed for patient, or consumer <br/>
use, such as Blue Button 2.0 (CMS’ Medicare FFS open API for patient access to health <br/>
information), and the development of patient-facing consumer applications that aggregate <br/>
various longitudinal health information for the patient into one location. We plan to continue to <br/>
review the public comments we receive to help identify opportunities for CMS to advance <br/>
interoperability in future rulemaking and subregulatory guidance. <br/>
CMS is also working with partners in the private sector to promote interoperability. In <br/>
2018, CMS began participating in the Da Vinci project, a private-sector initiative led by Health <br/>
Level 7 (HL7), a standards development organization. For one of the use cases under this project <br/>
– called “Coverage Requirements and Documentation Rules Discovery” – the Da Vinci project <br/>
developed a draft Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard during the summer <br/>
and fall of 2018. In June 2018, in support of the Da Vinci project, the CMS Medicare FFS <br/>
program began: (1) developing a prototype Documentation Requirement Lookup Service for the <br/>
Medicare FFS program; (2) populating it with the list of items/services for which prior <br/>
authorization is required by the Medicare FFS program; and (3) populating it with the <br/>
documentation rules for oxygen and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) devices.  <br/>

We encourage all payers, including but not limited to MA organizations, Medicaid <br/>
managed care plans and CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs to follow CMS’s <br/>
example and align with the Da Vinci Project to: (1) develop a similar lookup service; (2) <br/>
populate it with their list of items/services for which prior authorization is required; and (3) <br/>
populate it with the documentation rules for at least oxygen and CPAP. By taking this step, <br/>
health plans can join CMS in helping to build an ecosystem that will allow providers to connect <br/>

their EHRs or practice management systems and efficient work flows with up-to-date <br/>
information on which items and services require prior authorization and what the documentation <br/>
requirements are for various items and services under that patient’s current plan enrollment.   <br/>
In the 8 years since the first HHS rulemakings to implement HITECH, significant <br/>
progress has been made in the adoption of EHRs by hospitals and clinicians; however, progress <br/>
on interoperability needs to be accelerated.  <br/>
In section 106(b) of MACRA, Congress declared it a national objective to achieve <br/>
widespread exchange of health information through interoperable certified EHR technology <br/>
nationwide by December 31, 2018. Not later than July 1, 2016, the Secretary was to establish <br/>
metrics to be used to determine if and to the extent this objective was achieved. If the objective is <br/>
not achieved by December 31, 2018, the Secretary must submit a report not later than December <br/>
31, 2019, that identifies barriers to the objective and recommends actions that the federal <br/>
government can take to achieve the objective. In April 2016, ONC published the “Office of the <br/>
National Coordinator for Health Information Technology; Medicare Access and CHIP <br/>
Reauthorization Act of 2015; Request for Information Regarding Assessing Interoperability for <br/>
MACRA” RFI (81 FR 20651).  Based on stakeholder input received in response to the RFI, ONC <br/>
subsequently identified the following two metrics for interoperability (see <br/>
<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/fulfilling_section_106b1c_of_the_medicare_access_and_chip_reauthorization_act_of_2015_06.30.16.pdf">https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/fulfilling_section_106b1c_of_the_medicare_access_a</a><br/>

●  Measure #1: Proportion of health care providers who are electronically engaging in the <br/>
following core domains of interoperable exchange of health information: sending, receiving, <br/>
finding (querying), and integrating information received from outside sources. <br/>
●  Measure #2: Proportion of health care providers who report using the information they <br/>
electronically receive from outside providers and sources for clinical decision-making. <br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b>15</b>  <br/>
ONC recently provided an update on these metrics in its 2018 Report to Congress - <br/>
Annual Update on the Adoption of a Nationwide System for the Electronic Use and Exchange of <br/>
Health Information (s<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2018-12/2018-HITECH-report-to-congress.pdf">ee https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2018-12/2018-</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2018-12/2018-HITECH-report-to-congress.pdf">HITECH-report-to-congress.pdf)</a>. ONC will continue to evaluate nationwide performance <br/>
according to the identified metrics, and believes current developments, such as policy changes <br/>
being implemented under the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) (Pub. L. 114-255, enacted <br/>
December 13, 2016) will contribute to increasingly improved performance under these metrics. <br/>
In addition, the Cures Act included provisions to advance interoperability and health <br/>
information exchange, including, for example, enhancements to ONC’s Health IT certification <br/>
program and a definition of “information blocking” (as discussed further in section VIII. of this <br/>
proposed rule). These provisions have been addressed in depth in ONC’s proposed rule “21st <br/>
Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification <br/>
Program” (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>).    <br/>
Section 4003 of the Cures Act added a definition of “interoperability” as paragraph 10 of <br/>
section 3000 of the PHSA (42 U.S.C. 300jj (9)) (as amended). Under section 3000 of the PHSA, <br/>
‘interoperability’, with respect to health IT, means technology that enables the secure exchange <br/>
of electronic health information with, and use of electronic health information from, other health <br/>
IT without special effort on the part of the user.  It also allows for complete access, exchange, <br/>
and use of all electronically accessible health information for authorized use under applicable <br/>
state or federal law and does not constitute information blocking as defined in section 3022(a) of <br/>
the PHSA.<b> </b><br/>
 <br/>
This definition aligns with the definition under MACRA and the HHS vision and strategy <br/>
for achieving a health information ecosystem within which all individuals and their health care <br/>
providers are able to send, receive, find, and use electronic health information in a manner that is <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=16></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>16</b>  <br/>
appropriate, secure, timely, and reliable to support the health and wellness of individuals through <br/>
informed shared decision-making, as well as through patient choice of health plans and <br/>
providers. Accordingly, except where we further or otherwise specify for a specific policy or <br/>
purpose, when we use the term “interoperability” within this proposed rule we are referring to <br/>
the definition in section 3000 of the PHSA.<b> </b><br/>
E. Challenges and Barriers to Interoperability  <br/>
Through significant stakeholder feedback, we understand that there are many barriers to <br/>
interoperability which have obstructed progress over the years. We have conducted stakeholder <br/>
meetings and roundtables; solicited comments via RFIs; and received additional feedback <br/>
through letters and rulemaking. All of this input together has contributed to our proposals in this <br/>
proposed rule. Some of the main barriers shared with us are addressed in the following sections. <br/>
While we have made efforts to address some of these barriers in this proposed rule and through <br/>
prior rules and actions, we believe there is still considerable work to be done to overcome some <br/>
of these considerable challenges toward achieving interoperability. <br/>
1.  Patient Identifier and Interoperability  <br/>
In the Interoperability RFI in the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule (83 FR 20550), we <br/>
solicited feedback on positive solutions to better achieve interoperability or the sharing of health <br/>
care information between providers. A number of commenters noted that the lack of a unique <br/>
patient identifier (UPI) inhibited interoperability efforts because, without a unique identifier for <br/>
each patient, the safe and secure electronic exchange of health information is constrained <br/>
because it is difficult to ensure that the relevant records are all for the same patient. <br/>
As part of efforts to reduce the administrative costs of providing and paying for health <br/>
care, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (Pub. L. 104-<br/>
191, enacted August 21, 1996) required the adoption of a “unique individual identifier for <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=17></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>17</b>  <br/>
healthcare purposes,” commonly referred to as a UPI.  At the time HIPAA was enacted, HHS <br/>
began to consider what information would be needed to develop a rule to adopt a UPI standard. <br/>
An initial Notice of Intent to issue a proposed rule on requirements for a unique health identifier <br/>
for individuals was published in the November 2, 1998 <b>Federal Register</b> (63 FR 61773-61774).  <br/>
Such an identifier has the potential to facilitate the accurate portability of health <br/>
information by allowing correct patient matching because the universal identifier allows for <br/>
accurate and timely patient record linking between providers across the care continuum and it <br/>
allows a patient’s complete record to easily move with them from provider to provider. However, <br/>
stakeholders immediately raised significant concerns regarding the impact of this UPI on health <br/>
information security and privacy. Stakeholders were concerned that if there was a single <br/>
identifier used across systems, it would be easier for that information to be compromised, <br/>
exposing protected health information (PHI) more easily than in the current medical record <br/>
environment that generally requires linking several pieces of personally identifying information <br/>
to link health records. <br/>
The National Committee on Vital Health Statistics (NCVHS), the statutory public <br/>
advisory body to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) for health data, <br/>
statistics, privacy, and national health information policy and HIPAA, conducted extensive <br/>
hearings in the first year after HIPAA was enacted to evaluate this and other HIPAA-related <br/>
implementation issues. The NCVHS First Annual Report to the Congress on the Implementation <br/>
of the Administrative Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and <br/>
Accountability Act, February 3, 1998, outlines the NCVHS’ efforts to obtain feedback on the <br/>
UP<a href="https://ncvhs.hhs.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yr1-rpt-508.pdf">I (https://ncvhs.hhs.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yr1-rpt-508.pdf)</a>. Through this process, <br/>
NCVHS found a lack of consensus on how best to define a UPI and controversy around the use <br/>
of a UPI due to privacy and data security concerns. Those in favor of adopting a UPI believe a <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=18></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>18</b>  <br/>
UPI is the most efficient way to foster information sharing and accurate patient record linking, <br/>
where those against it are concerned about patient privacy and data security. NCVHS found <br/>
these privacy and data security concerns outweighed the benefits of a UPI.  <br/>
The NCVHS recommended that the Secretary not move forward with a proposed rule on <br/>
a patient identifier until further discussions could be had to fully understand the privacy and data <br/>
security concerns, as well as the full breadth of options beyond a single identifier.  NCVHS <br/>
suggested the Secretary work to maximize public participation in soliciting a variety of options <br/>
for establishing an identifier or an alternative approach for identifying individuals and linking <br/>
health information of individuals for health purposes.  <br/>
Appreciating the significant concerns raised by stakeholders regarding implementing a <br/>
UPI, Congress included language in the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental <br/>
Appropriations Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277, enacted October 21, 1998) and in each subsequent <br/>
Appropriations bill, stating “None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to <br/>
promulgate or adopt any final standard under section 1173(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d–2(b)) <br/>
providing for, or providing for the assignment of, a unique health identifier for an individual <br/>
(except in an individual’s capacity as an employer or a health care provider), until legislation is <br/>
enacted specifically approving the standard.” This language has effectively prohibited HHS from <br/>
engaging in rulemaking to adopt a UPI standard. Consequently, the Secretary withdrew the <br/>
Notice of Intent to pursue rulemaking on this issue on August 9, 2000 <br/>
<a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=200010&RIN=0938-AI91">(https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=200010&amp;RIN=0938-AI91).</a> <br/>
In recent years, concerns regarding the privacy and security of information have only <br/>
increased.  For example, in the first quarter through third quarter of FY 2018 (October 1, 2017 <br/>
through June 30, 2018), 276 breach incidents were reported to the HHS Office of Civil Rights <br/>
(OCR) affecting 4,341,595 individuals <a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf">(https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf)</a>. <br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b>19</b>  <br/>
Although the appropriations language regarding the UPI standard has remained <br/>
unchanged, in the report accompanying the 2017 appropriations bill, Congress additionally <br/>
stated, “Although the Committee continues to carry a prohibition against HHS using funds to <br/>
promulgate or adopt any final standard providing for the assignment of a unique health identifier <br/>
for an individual until such activity is authorized, the Committee notes that this limitation does <br/>
not prohibit HHS from examining the issues around patient matching. Accordingly, the <br/>
Committee encouraged the Secretary, acting through ONC and CMS, to provide technical <br/>
assistance to private-sector led initiatives to develop a coordinated national strategy that will <br/>
promote patient safety by accurately identifying patients to their health information.” (H.R. Rep. <br/>
No. 114–<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114hrpt699/pdf/CRPT-114hrpt699.pdf">699, p. 110, https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114hrpt699/pdf/CRPT-</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114hrpt699/pdf/CRPT-114hrpt699.pdf">114hrpt699.pdf)</a>. Congress has repeated this guidance for 2018 and 2019. This guidance directed <br/>
HHS to focus on examining issues around patient matching and to provide technical assistance to <br/>
private sector-led initiatives focusing on a patient matching solution.  <br/>
Unlike a UPI, which assigns a unique identifier – either numerical or otherwise – to each <br/>
patient, patient matching is a process by which health information from multiple sources is <br/>
compared to identify common elements, with the goal of identifying records representing a <br/>
single patient. This is generally done by using multiple demographic data fields such as name, <br/>
birth date, gender, and address. The goal of patient matching is to link one patient’s data across <br/>
multiple databases within and across health care providers in order to obtain a comprehensive <br/>
view of that patient’s health care information. <br/>
ONC has stated that patient matching is critically important to interoperability and the <br/>
nation’s health IT infrastructure as health care providers must be able to share patient health <br/>
information and accurately match a patient to his or her data from a different provider in order <br/>
for many anticipated interoperability benefits to be realized.  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=20></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>20</b>  <br/>
Patient matching can be less precise than a UPI due to the reliance on demographic <br/>
attributes (such as name and date of birth) which are not unique traits to a particular patient; <br/>
further, patient matching is often dependent on manual data entry and data maintained in varying <br/>
formats. Matching mistakes can contribute to adverse events, compromised safety and privacy, <br/>
and increased health care costs (s<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/hie-interoperability/nationwide-interoperability-roadmap-final-version-1.0.pdf">ee https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/hie-</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/hie-interoperability/nationwide-interoperability-roadmap-final-version-1.0.pdf">interoperability/nationwide-interoperability-roadmap-final-version-1.0.pdf)</a>.  However, a wide <br/>
range of strategies and best practices currently being deployed across the industry have been <br/>
shown to improve patient matching rates, suggesting that patient matching approaches can be an <br/>
effective solution when appropriately implemented (see <br/>
<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/patient_identification_matching_final_report.pdf">https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/patient_identification_matching_final_report.pdf).</a> <br/>
Many stakeholders commenting on the interoperability RFIs included in the 2019 <br/>
proposed payment rules indicated that patient matching is a “core functionality” of patient <br/>
identification and necessary to ensure care coordination and the best patient outcomes. <br/>
Commenters also noted that a consistently used matching strategy could accomplish the original <br/>
goals of a UPI with a diminished risk to individual privacy and health information security.  <br/>
Several commenters noted that the lack of a UPI impacted interoperability, but finding a <br/>
suitable and consistent matching strategy could address this issue. These commenters often <br/>
specifically supported Congress’ guidance to have ONC and CMS provide technical assistance to <br/>
the private sector to identify this strategy. To help jump start the process of finding a solution to <br/>
patient matching, ONC launched the Patient Matching Algorithm Challenge in 2017, awarding <br/>
six winners $75,000 in grants in late 2017 <br/>
<a href="https://www.patientmatchingchallenge.com/challenge-information/challenge-details">(https://www.patientmatchingchallenge.com/challenge-information/challenge-details)</a>. The goal <br/>
of the Patient Matching Algorithm Challenge was to bring about greater transparency and data <br/>
on the performance of existing patient matching algorithms, spur the adoption of performance <br/>
<hr/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>21</b>  <br/>
metrics for patient data matching algorithm vendors, and positively impact other aspects of <br/>
patient matching such as deduplication and linking to clinical data.  <br/>
We continue to support ONC’s work promoting the development of patient matching <br/>
initiatives. Per Congress’ guidance, ONC is looking at innovative ways to provide technical <br/>
assistance to private sector-led initiatives to further develop accurate patient matching solutions <br/>
in order to promote interoperability without requiring a UPI.  <br/>
We understand the significant health information privacy and security concerns raised <br/>
around the development of a UPI standard and the current prohibition against using HHS funds <br/>
to adopt a UPI standard. Recognizing Congress’ statement regarding patient matching and <br/>
stakeholder comments stating that a patient matching solution would accomplish the goals of a <br/>
UPI, we seek comment for future consideration on ways for ONC and CMS to continue to <br/>
facilitate private sector efforts on a workable and scalable patient matching strategy so that the <br/>
lack of a specific UPI does not impede the free flow of information. We also seek comment on <br/>
how we may leverage our program authority to provide support to those working to improve <br/>
patient matching. In addition, we intend to use comments for the development of policy and <br/>
future rulemaking. <br/>
2.  Lack of standardization <br/>
 <br/>
Lack of standardization inhibits the successful exchange of health information without <br/>
additional effort on the part of the end user. To achieve secure exchange of health information <br/>
across health IT products and systems that can be readily used without special effort by the user, <br/>
both the interface technology and the underlying data must be standardized, so all systems are <br/>
“speaking the same language.” Consistent use of modern computing standards and applicable <br/>
content standards (such as clinical vocabularies) are fundamental to achieving full-scale <br/>
technical interoperability (systems can connect and exchange data unaltered) and semantic <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=22></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>22</b>  <br/>
interoperability (systems can interpret and use the information that has been exchanged). Lack of <br/>
such standards creates a barrier to interoperability. Where specific standards are not consistently <br/>
used, particularly to structure exchange interfaces such as APIs, the exchange is more difficult <br/>
and expensive than it needs to be and the recipient of exchanged data must often undertake <br/>
substantial special effort to make sense of the information.    <br/>
In this proposed rule, similar to CMS’ Blue Button 2.0 approach for Medicare FFS<a href="CMSs.html#22">3</a>, we <br/>
propose to require that all MA organizations, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care <br/>
entities, Medicaid state agencies, CHIP agencies that operate FFS systems, and issuers of QHPs <br/>
in the FFEs, deploy standardized, open APIs to make certain information available to enrollees <br/>
as discussed in section III. of this proposed rule. <br/>
The lack of a sufficiently mature API functionality technical standard has posed a <br/>
challenge and impediment to advancing interoperability. In 2015, ONC finalized an API <br/>
functionality certification criterion in the “2015 Edition Health Information Technology (Health <br/>
IT) Certification Criteria, 2015 Edition Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) Definition, and <br/>
ONC Health IT Certification Program Modifications” Final Rule (2015 Edition final rule) (80 <br/>
FR 62602). However, while a consensus technical standard specific to the API technical <br/>
functionality was in development, it had not yet matured enough for inclusion in the 2015 <br/>
Edition final rule, which does not identify a specific standard for API functionality.   <br/>
As discussed in greater detail in section II of this proposed rule, we believe that a specific <br/>
foundational standard for API functionality has matured sufficiently enough for ONC to propose <br/>
it for HHS adoption (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>). To take full advantage of <br/>
this proposed standard, as well as already adopted standards applicable to content exchanged via <br/>
APIs, we propose in sections II. and III. of this proposed rule to require that MA organizations, <br/>
                                                           <br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>23</b>  <br/>
Medicaid managed care plans, Medicaid state agencies, CHIP managed care entities, CHIP <br/>
agencies that operate FFS systems, and QHP issuers in FFEs deploy API technologies <br/>
conformant with the API technical standard proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR <br/>
170.215 and other applicable standards such as content and vocabulary standards adopted at 45 <br/>
CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.160, and proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.213  <br/>
(published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>). Furthermore, we note that we intend to continue <br/>
to work with stakeholders to develop standards that will advance interoperability. <br/>
3.  Information Blocking  <br/>
As explained above, information blocking is defined in section 3022(a) of the PHSA. <br/>
Understanding this definition, information blocking could be considered to include the practice <br/>
of withholding data, or intentionally taking action to limit or restrict the compatibility or <br/>
interoperability of health IT. Through stakeholder outreach, roundtables, and letters we have <br/>
received, we understand that health care providers may limit or prevent data exchange in an <br/>
effort to retain patients. By withholding a patient’s health information from competing health <br/>
care providers, a health care provider can effectively inhibit a patient from freely moving within <br/>
the health care market because that patient would not otherwise have access to their complete <br/>
health information.  <br/>
We additionally understand from stakeholder feedback that in certain cases a health IT <br/>
vendor has prohibited the movement of data from one health IT system to another in an effort to <br/>
maintain their customer base.  <br/>
Information blocking is a significant threat to interoperability and can limit the ability for <br/>
providers to coordinate care and treat a patient based on the most comprehensive information <br/>
available. In sections VIII.B. and C. of this proposed rule we propose to publicly report the <br/>
names of clinicians and hospitals who submit a “no” response to certain attestation statements <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=24></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>24</b>  <br/>
related to the prevention of information blocking in order to deter health care providers from <br/>
engaging in conduct that could be considered information blocking. <br/>
Preventing and avoiding information blocking is important to advancing interoperability. <br/>
We believe this proposal would help discourage health care providers from information blocking <br/>
and clearly indicates CMS’s commitment to preventing such practices. <br/>
4.  Lack of adoption/use of certified health IT among post-acute care (PAC) providers <br/>
PAC facilities are critical in the care of patients’ post-hospital discharge, and can be a <br/>
determining step in the health progress for those patients.<a href="CMSs.html#24">4</a> Interoperable health IT can improve <br/>
the ability of these facilities to coordinate and provide care; however, long-term care and PAC <br/>
providers, such as nursing homes, home health agencies (HHAs), long-term care providers, and <br/>
others, were not eligible for the EHR Incentive Programs under the HITECH Act. Based on the <br/>
information we have, we understand that this was a contributing factor to these providers not <br/>
adopting CEHRT at the same rate as eligible hospitals and physicians, who were able to adopt <br/>
CEHRT using the financial incentives provided under the programs.<a href="CMSs.html#24">5</a>,<a href="CMSs.html#24">6</a> <br/>
While a majority of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) used an EHR in 2016 (64 percent), <br/>
there is considerable work to be done to increase adoption and the exchange of data in this <br/>
provider population. In that same year, only three out of 10 SNFs electronically exchanged (that <br/>
is, sent or received) key clinical health information, and only 7 percent had the ability to <br/>
electronically send, receive, find, and integrate patient health information. In 2017, an ONC <br/>
survey found that more HHA) (78 percent) adopted EHRs than SNFs (66 percent), but <br/>
integration of received information continued to lag behind for both HHAs (36 percent) and <br/>
                                                           <br/>

SNFs (18 percent). While both ONC surveys focused on SNFs, it is important to note the large <br/>
provider overlap between SNFs and other nursing facilities. In 2014, 14,409 out of 15,640 (92 <br/>
percent) of nursing homes were certified for both Medicare and Medicaid.<a href="CMSs.html#25">7</a> <br/>

required to submit to CMS standardized patient assessment data described in section <br/>
1899B(b)(1) of the Act (as added by section 2(a) of the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care <br/>
Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act) (Pub. L. 113-185, enacted October 6, 2014)). We <br/>
have defined the term “standardized patient assessment data” (or “standardized resident <br/>
assessment data” for purposes of SNFs) as patient or resident assessment questions and response <br/>
options that are identical in all four PAC assessment instruments, and to which identical <br/>
standards and definitions apply. Section 1899B(b)(1)(B) of the Act states that the categories for <br/>
which standardized patient or resident assessment data must be submitted include, at a minimum, <br/>
functional status; cognitive function; medical conditions and co-morbidities; special services, <br/>
treatments and interventions; and impairments. Section 1899B(b)(1)(A) of the Act requires that <br/>
such data must be submitted through the applicable reporting provision that applies to each PAC <br/>
provider type using the PAC assessment instrument that applies to the PAC provider. Section <br/>
1899B(a)(1)(B) of the Act additionally requires that these data be standardized and interoperable <br/>
so as to allow for their exchange among health care providers, including PAC providers, to <br/>
ensure coordinated care and improved Medicare beneficiary outcomes as these patients transition <br/>
throughout the care continuum. To enable the interoperable exchange of such information, we <br/>
have adopted certain patient assessment data elements as standardized patient or resident <br/>
assessment data and mapped them to appropriate health IT standards which can support the <br/>
                                                           <br/>

5.  Privacy Concerns and HIPAA <br/>
The Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules under HIPAA (45 CFR parts 160 <br/>
and 164) support interoperability by providing assurance to the public that PHI as defined in 45 <br/>
CFR 160.103 is maintained securely and shared only for appropriate purposes or with express <br/>
authorization of the individual.  For more than a decade, the HIPAA Rules have provided a <br/>
strong privacy and security foundation for the health care system.  However, we have heard that <br/>
lack of harmonization between federal and state privacy and security standards can create <br/>
uncertainty or confusion for HIPAA covered entities that want to exchange health information. <br/>
Resources about how the HIPAA Rule permits health care providers and health plans to share <br/>
health information using health IT for purposes like treatment or care coordination is available <br/>
on the HHS OCR website. S<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/permitted-uses/index.html">ee https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/permitted-uses/index.html">professionals/privacy/guidance/permitted-uses/index.html.  </a> <br/>
Although barriers to interoperability do exist, HHS and private industry are actively <br/>
working to address them. On June 6, 2018, the HHS Deputy Secretary initiated the Regulatory <br/>
Sprint to Coordinated Care (RS2CC). In support of this effort, the HHS Office of Inspector <br/>
General (OIG) released an RFI on barriers to coordinated care or value-based care, which was <br/>
out for public comment through October 26, 2018 (83 FR 43607). Together, CMS and ONC are <br/>
working to address information blocking via rulemaking. We are actively working to improve <br/>
data standardization, particularly through the use of APIs. And, we are using available policy <br/>
levers to encourage greater adoption of EHR technology and interoperability among PAC <br/>
providers. We provide resources to help providers see how HIPAA and interoperability work <br/>

together. And, we are leveraging private sector relationships to find patient matching solutions in <br/>
lieu of a patient identifier.  <br/>
F.  Summary of Major Provisions<b> </b><br/>
To empower beneficiaries of Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs and enrollees in MA <br/>
organizations, Medicaid and CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in the FFEs (when <br/>
mentioned throughout this proposed rule, this includes QHPs certified by FFEs regardless of <br/>
whether enrollees enroll through the FFE or off the FFE), we are proposing several initiatives to <br/>
break down the barriers that impede patients’ ease of access to their electronic health care <br/>
information; we propose to create and implement new mechanisms for them to access to their <br/>
own health care information, as well as the ability to decide how, when, and with whom to share <br/>
their information. We are proposing to require that a variety of information be made accessible to <br/>
these impacted patients via “openly published” (or simply “open”) APIs– that is, APIs for which <br/>
the technical and other information required for a third-party application to connect to them is <br/>
publicly available. This will provide these patients with convenient access to their health care <br/>
information in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule access standard at 45 CFR 164.524, and <br/>
an increase in their choice of applications with which to access and use their own electronic <br/>
health information, as discussed above, and other information relevant to managing their health, <br/>
enabling open APIs to improve competition and choice as they have in other industries. We <br/>
propose to require MA organizations, Medicaid state agencies, state CHIP agencies, Medicaid <br/>
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs to implement open <br/>
APIs consistent with the API technical standards proposed by ONC for adoption by HHS and to <br/>
use content and vocabulary standards adopted by HHS at 45 CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.160, <br/>
and proposed by ONC for adoption by HHS at 45 CFR 170.213  (published elsewhere in this <br/>
<b>Federal Register</b>)).   <br/>

 <br/>
Effective coordination and appropriate sharing of enrollee information between health <br/>
plans can reduce the need for providers to write duplicative letters of medical necessity, or it <br/>
could reduce instances of subjecting beneficiaries to unnecessary repetition of step therapy, or <br/>
repeated utilization reviews, risk screenings and assessments. It could also help to streamline <br/>
prior authorization procedures or reduce instances where the clinician might need to intervene <br/>
personally with a payer to ensure his or her patient received the treatment necessary. We are <br/>
proposing to require payers to support beneficiaries in coordinating their own care via payer to <br/>
payer care coordination. In addition to existing care coordination efforts between plans, we <br/>
propose that a plan must, if asked by the beneficiary, forward his or her information to a new <br/>
plan or other entity designated by the beneficiary for up to 5 years after the beneficiary has <br/>
disenrolled with the plan. Such transactions would be made in compliance with applicable laws. <br/>
We are proposing a requirement for MA Plans, Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care entities <br/>
(MCOs, PIHPs, PAHPs), and QHP issuers in FFEs to coordinate care between plans by <br/>
exchanging, at a minimum, the data elements in the United States Core Data for Interoperability <br/>
(USCDI) standard<a href="CMSs.html#28">8</a> at enrollee request at specified times. <br/>
We believe that payers’ ability to share enrollee claims, encounter data, utilization <br/>
history, and clinical health information they may have for their enrollees with one another, as <br/>
well as their ability to share that information with patients and health care providers, when <br/>
approved by the patient and appropriate under applicable law, using interoperable electronic <br/>
means will considerably improve patient access to information, reduce provider burden, and <br/>
reduce redundant and otherwise unnecessary data-related policies and procedures. We are <br/>
proposing to require that all MA organizations, Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care entities <br/>
(MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs), and QHP issuers in FFEs (with the exception of stand-alone dental <br/>
                                                           <br/>

plans (SADPs)) must participate in a trusted health information exchange network meeting <br/>
criteria for interoperability. Further, we discuss an approach to payer-to-payer and payer-to-<br/>
provider interoperability which leverages such existing trusts networks.  <br/>
States and CMS routinely exchange data to support the administration of benefits to <br/>
Medicare-Medicaid dually eligible beneficiaries. This includes “buy-in” data on who is enrolled <br/>
in Medicare, and who is liable for paying the dual eligible beneficiary’s Part A and B premiums. <br/>
Buy-in data exchanges support state, CMS, and Social Security Administration (SSA) premium <br/>
accounting, collections, and enrollment functions. This also includes “MMA” data on dual <br/>
eligibility status (called the “MMA file” after the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and <br/>
Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108-173, enacted December 8, 2003)), which are <br/>
used in all four Parts of Medicare. We are proposing to establish frequency requirements to <br/>
require all states to participate in daily exchange of buy-in data with CMS by April 1, 2022, and <br/>
to update frequency requirements to require all states to submit MMA file data to CMS daily by <br/>
April 1, 2022.  <br/>
We are actively working with our partners throughout HHS to deter the practice of <br/>
information blocking. We believe it would benefit patients to know if their health care providers <br/>
attested negatively to any of the prevention of information blocking attestation statements under <br/>
the Quality Payment Program (QPP) or the Medicare FFS Promoting Interoperability Program.  <br/>
In previous testing with patients and caregivers, we have learned that effective use of CEHRT is <br/>
important to them when making informed health care decisions. To address this issue, we are <br/>
proposing to publicly post information about negative attestations on appropriate CMS websites.   <br/>
Section 4003 of the Cures Act recognized the importance of making provider digital <br/>
contact information available through a common directory. To facilitate this, CMS has updated <br/>
the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) to be able to capture this digital <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=30></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>30</b>  <br/>
contact information. Now that the systems are in place, we seek to increase the number of <br/>
clinicians with valid and current digital contact information available through NPPES. We are <br/>
proposing to publicly identify those clinicians who have not submitted digital contact <br/>
information in NPPES. Further, we are proposing to align program requirements for MA <br/>
organizations, Medicaid state agencies, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP agencies that <br/>
operate FFS systems, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs (with the exception <br/>
of issuers of SADPs) such that each payer/plan issuer would make provider directory <br/>
information publicly available via an API. <br/>
Electronic patient event notifications from hospitals, or clinical event notifications, are <br/>
widely recognized as an effective tool for improving care coordination across settings, especially <br/>
for patients at admission, discharge, and transfer. We are proposing to revise the conditions of <br/>
participation for hospitals (including short-term acute care hospitals, long-term care hospitals <br/>
(LTCHs), rehabilitation hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, children’s hospitals, and cancer <br/>
hospitals) and CAHs to require that these entities send patient event notifications to another <br/>
health care facility or to another community provider. We propose to limit this requirement to <br/>
only those Medicare- and Medicaid-participating hospitals and CAHs that possess EHRs systems <br/>
with the technical capacity to generate information for electronic patient event notifications. <br/>
We also plan to test ways to promote interoperability across the health care spectrum <br/>
through models tested by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (&#34;Innovation <br/>
Center&#34;). Innovation Center models offer a unique opportunity to engage with health care <br/>
providers and other entities in innovative ways and to test concepts that have the ability to <br/>
accelerate change in the U.S. health care system, including to promote interoperability. As such, <br/>
we are soliciting public comment on general principles around interoperability within Innovation <br/>
Center models for integration into new models, through provisions in model participation <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=31></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>31</b>  <br/>
agreements or other governing documents. In applying these general principles, we intend to be <br/>
sensitive to the details of individual model design, and the characteristics and capacities of the <br/>
participants in each specific model.  <br/>
One of the many proposals we considered but did not include in this proposed rule was a <br/>
proposal to make updates to the Promoting Interoperability Program (formerly the Medicare and <br/>
Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs) to encourage eligible hospitals and CAHs to engage in <br/>
certain activities focused on interoperability. This concept was initially introduced in a request <br/>
for public comment in the FY 2019 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (83 FR 20537 through <br/>
20538). We discussed a possible future strategy in which we would create a set of priority health <br/>
IT or “interoperability” activities that would serve as alternatives to measures in the Promoting <br/>
Interoperability Program. We discussed creating a set of priority health IT activities with a focus <br/>
on interoperability and simplification to reduce health care provider burden while allowing <br/>
flexibility to pursue innovative applications of health IT to improve care delivery. We offered <br/>
three different examples of activities which might be included under such an approach, <br/>
including:   <br/>
●  Participation in, or serving as, a health information network which is part of the <br/>
Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA);  <br/>
●  Maintaining an open API which allows persistent access to third parties which enables <br/>
patients to access their health information; and  <br/>
●  Participating in piloting and testing of new standards that support emerging <br/>
interoperability use cases.  <br/>
While we are not proposing this here, we expect to introduce a proposal for establishing <br/>
“interoperability activities” in the FY 2020 IPPS/LTCH PPS rulemaking in conjunction with <br/>
other updates to the Promoting Interoperability Program. To help inform future rulemaking, we <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=32></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>32</b>  <br/>
invite comments on the concepts discussed above, as well as other ideas for “interoperability <br/>
activities” for which eligible hospitals and CAHs could receive credit in lieu of reporting on <br/>
program measures. <br/>
Finally, we include two RFIs. One related to interoperability and health IT adoption in <br/>
PAC settings, and one related to the role of patient matching in interoperability and improved <br/>
patient care. <br/>
<b>II.  Technical Standards Related to Interoperability </b><br/>
A. Technical Approach and Standards <br/>
1. Use of FHIR for APIs <br/>
The MACRA defines interoperability as the ability of two or more health information <br/>
systems or components to exchange clinical and other information and to use the information <br/>
that has been exchanged using common standards such as to provide access to longitudinal <br/>
information for health care providers in order to facilitate coordinated care and improved patient <br/>
outcomes.  Interoperability is also defined in section 3000 of the Public Health Service Act <br/>
(PHSA) (42 U.S.C. 300jj), as amended by section 4003 of the Cures Act.  Under that definition, <br/>
“interoperability”, with respect to health IT, means such health IT that enables the secure <br/>
exchange of electronic health information with, and use of electronic health information from, <br/>
other health IT without special effort on the part of the user; allows for complete access, <br/>
exchange, and use of all electronically accessible health information for authorized use under <br/>
applicable state or federal law; and does not constitute information blocking as defined in section <br/>
3022(a) of the PHSA, which was added by section 4004 of the Cures Act. We believe the PHSA <br/>
definition is consistent with the MACRA definition of interoperability. As noted at the outset of <br/>
this proposed rule, for the purposes of this proposed rule and this specific section, we will use the <br/>
PHSA definition. <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=33></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>33</b>  <br/>
We believe the PHSA definition of interoperability is useful as a foundational reference <br/>
for our approach to advancing interoperability and exchange of electronic health information for <br/>
individuals throughout the United States, and across the entire spectrum of provider types and <br/>
care settings with which health plan issuers and administrators need to efficiently exchange <br/>
multiple types of relevant data. We note the PHSA definition of interoperability is not applied <br/>
only to a specific program or initiative but to all activities under the title of the PHSA that <br/>
establishes ONC’s responsibilities to support and shape the health information ecosystem, <br/>
including exchange infrastructure for the United States health care system as a whole. The PHSA <br/>
definition of interoperability is also consistent with HHS’s vision and strategies for achieving a <br/>
health information ecosystem within which all individuals, their families, and health care <br/>
providers are able to send, receive, find, and use electronic health information in a manner that is <br/>
appropriate, secure, timely, and reliable to support the health and wellness of individuals through <br/>
informed, shared decision-making,<a href="CMSs.html#33">9 </a>as well as to support consumer choice of health plans and <br/>
providers.   <br/>
A core policy principle we aim to support across all proposals in this proposed rule is that <br/>
every American should be able, without special effort or advanced technical skills, to see, obtain, <br/>
and use all electronically available information that is relevant to their health, care, and choices – <br/>
of plans, providers, and specific treatment options. This includes two types of information: <br/>
information specifically about the individual that requires appropriate diligence to protect the <br/>
individual’s privacy, such as their current and past medical conditions and care received, as well <br/>
as information that is of general interest and should be widely available, such as plan provider <br/>
networks, the plan’s formulary, and coverage policies. <br/>
                                                           <br/>

While many consumers today can often access their own electronic health information <br/>
through patient/enrollee portals and proprietary applications made available by various providers <br/>
and health plans, they must typically go through separate processes to obtain access to each <br/>
system, and often need to manually aggregate information that is delivered in various, often non-<br/>
standardized, formats. The complex tasks of accessing and piecing together this information can <br/>
be burdensome and frustrating to consumers.   <br/>
In contrast, consider the ease with which consumers can choose and use a navigation <br/>
application which integrates information on their current location, preferences, and real-time <br/>
traffic conditions to choose the best route to a chosen destination. Consumers do not have to log <br/>
into a different “location” portal to learn their current geographic coordinates, write them down, <br/>
and then log into a separate “map” portal to enter their current coordinates to request directions <br/>
to their destination.       <br/>
An API can be thought of as a set of commands, functions, protocols, or tools published <br/>
by one software developer (“A”) that enable other software developers to create programs <br/>
(applications or “apps”) that can interact with A’s software without needing to know the internal <br/>
workings of A’s software, all while maintaining consumer privacy data standards. This is how <br/>
API technology enables the seamless user experiences associated with applications familiar from <br/>
other aspects of many consumers’ daily lives, such as travel and personal finance. Standardized, <br/>
transparent, and pro-competitive API technology can enable similar benefits to consumers of <br/>
health care services.<a href="CMSs.html#34">10</a>   <br/>
While acknowledging the limits of our authority to require use of APIs to address our <br/>
goals for interoperability and data access, we are proposing in this rule to use our programmatic <br/>
                                                           <br/>
10 ONC has made available a succinct, non-technical overview of APIs in context of consumers’ access to their own <br/>medical information across multiple providers’ EHR systems, which is available at the HealthIT.gov website at <br/><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/api-education-module/story_html5.html">https://www.healthit.gov/api-education-module/story_html5.html. </a>  <br/>

<b>35</b>  <br/>
authority in Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and over QHPs in FFEs to advance these goals.  <br/>
Therefore, we are proposing to require that a variety of data be made accessible to MA enrollees, <br/>
Medicaid beneficiaries, CHIP enrollees, and enrollees in QHPs in FFEs, by requiring that MA <br/>
organizations, Medicaid state agencies, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP agencies, CHIP <br/>
managed care entities, and QHPs in FFEs, adopt and implement “openly published” (or simply <br/>
“open”) APIs. Having certain data available through open APIs would allow these enrollees to <br/>
use the application of their choice to access and use their own electronic health information and <br/>
other information relevant to managing their health.   <br/>
Much like our efforts under the Medicare Blue Button 2.0 and MyHealthEData <br/>
initiatives, which made Parts A, B, and D claims data available to Medicare beneficiaries, our <br/>
proposal would result in claims and coverage information being accessible for the vast majority <br/>
of Medicare beneficiaries by requiring MA organizations to take new steps – by implementing <br/>
the API described in this proposed rule – to make claims data available to their enrollees. We <br/>
expect that our proposal would also benefit all Medicaid beneficiaries because our proposal <br/>
applies to Medicaid state agencies (which administer Medicaid FFS programs), and all types of <br/>
Medicaid managed care plans (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs), and CHIP agencies (which <br/>
administer CHIP FFS) and CHIP managed care entities (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs). Finally, <br/>
while our proposal is only applicable to QHPs in FFEs, we hope that states operating Exchanges <br/>
might consider adopting similar requirements for QHPs in State-Based Exchanges (SBEs), and <br/>
that other payers in the private sector might consider voluntarily offering data accessibility of the <br/>
type included in this proposal so that even more patients across the American health care system <br/>
can easily have and use such information to advance their choice and participation in their health <br/>
care. We hope that the example being set by CMS will raise consumers’ expectations and <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=36></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>36</b>  <br/>
encourage other payers in the market to take similar steps to advance patient access and <br/>
empowerment outside the scope of our proposed requirements.   <br/>
An “open API,” for purposes of this proposed rule, is simply one for which the technical <br/>
and other information required for a third-party application to connect to it is openly published.  <br/>
Open API does not imply any and all applications or application developers would have <br/>
unfettered access to people’s personal or sensitive information. Rather, an open API’s published <br/>
technical and other information specifically includes what an application developer would need <br/>
to know to connect to and obtain data available through the API. <br/>
We recommend reviewing the discussion of the standardized API criterion and associated <br/>
policy principles and technical standards included in ONC’s proposed rule “21st Century Cures <br/>
Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program” <br/>
(published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>) for those seeking more detailed information on <br/>
API functionality and interoperability standards relevant to electronic health information. While <br/>
that discussion is specific to health IT certified under ONC’s Health IT Certification Program <br/>
rather than the information systems generally used by payers and plan issuers for claims, <br/>
encounters, or other administrative or plan operational data, it includes information applicable to <br/>
interoperability standards, as well as considerations relevant to establishing reasonable and non-<br/>
discriminatory terms of service for applications seeking to connect to the open API. However, it <br/>
is important to reiterate that we are <i>not</i> proposing to require health plan issuers to use Health IT <br/>
Modules certified under ONC’s program to make administrative data such as claims history or <br/>
provider directory information available to enrollees.    <br/>
In developing this proposed rule, we considered how to advance the sort of <br/>
interoperability and innovation in the health system supported by open APIs in other industries.  <br/>
We have also collaborated with ONC to align with and leverage relevant API policies ONC has <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=37></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>37</b>  <br/>
proposed to implement Cures Act requirements. In general, we believe three attributes of open <br/>
APIs are particularly important to achieve the goal of offering individuals convenient access, <br/>
through applications they choose, to available and relevant electronic health information. The <br/>
three API attributes are:  <br/>
●  The API technologies themselves, not just the data accessible through them, are <br/>
standardized;  <br/>
●  The APIs are technically transparent; and  <br/>
●  The APIs are implemented in a pro-competitive<i> </i>manner.  <br/>
In this section, we discuss these concepts generally and how they are applicable in the <br/>
health care context for all payers, as well as explain how these are relevant to our specific <br/>
proposals, which are discussed in detail in section III. of this proposed rule.  <br/>
a.  Standardized  <br/>
Technical consistency and implementation predictability are fundamental to scale API-<br/>
enabled interoperability and reduce the level and costs of custom development otherwise <br/>
necessary to access, exchange, and use health information. From an industry standpoint, a <br/>
consistent and predictable set of API functions, as well as content and formatting standards, <br/>
provide the health IT ecosystem with known technical requirements against which application <br/>
developers can build applications (including but not limited to “mobile apps”) and other <br/>
innovative services which users can select to access and manage the data they need. Therefore, to <br/>
achieve interoperability consistent with the PHSA definition, the proposals in section III. of this <br/>
proposed rule would effectively require that API technologies deployed by health plans subject <br/>
to this rule use modern computing standards (such as RESTful interfaces<a href="CMSs.html#37">11 </a>and XML/JSON), and <br/>
                                                           <br/>
11 “RESTful interfaces” are those that are consistent with Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style <br/>and communications approaches to web services development. <br/>

<b>38</b>  <br/>
present the requested information using widely recognized content standards (such as <br/>
standardized vocabularies of clinical terms), where applicable.   <br/>
b.  Transparent  <br/>
Transparency and openness around API documentation is commonplace in many other <br/>
industries and has fueled innovation, growth, and competition. Documentation associated with <br/>
APIs deployed by health care providers, health plans, and other entities engaged in exchanging <br/>
electronic health information typically addresses the information that would be material to <br/>
persons and entities that use or create software applications that interact with the API (API <br/>
users). Information material to API users includes, but is not necessarily limited to, all terms and <br/>
conditions for use of the API, including terms of service, restrictions, limitations, obligations, <br/>
registration process requirements, or other similar requirements that would be needed to:  <br/>
●  Develop software applications to interact with the API;  <br/>
●  Connect software applications to the API to access electronic health information <br/>
through the API;  <br/>
●  Use any electronic health information obtained by means of the API technology; and <br/>
●  Register software applications to connect with the API. <br/>
As discussed in section III. of this proposed rule, we are proposing that certain entities <br/>
(MA organizations, State Medicaid agencies, Medicaid managed care plan, State CHIP agencies, <br/>
CHIP managed care entities, and QHPs in FFEs), supported by the suppliers of their API <br/>
technology, and for the API technology they use to comply with the requirements we propose in <br/>
this proposed rule, be required to make freely and publicly accessible the specific business and <br/>
technical documentation necessary to interact with these APIs. This is aligned with the <br/>
requirements that ONC has proposed that the Secretary adopt for developers and users of health <br/>

IT certified to the API criteria proposed at 45 CFR 170.315 (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal </b><br/>
<b>Register</b>). <br/>
c.  Pro-competitive <br/>
Pro-competitive practices in selecting, configuring, and maintaining APIs are those <br/>
business practices that promote the efficient access to, exchange of, and use of electronic health <br/>
information to support a competitive marketplace that enhances consumer value and choice of <br/>
direct-to-consumer technology, health coverage, and care. We believe that an ultimate goal of all <br/>
participants in the health care ecosystem is that individuals should be able to use an application <br/>
they choose to connect and access, without special effort, their electronic health information held <br/>
by health care providers, health plans, or any health information networks, within practical and <br/>
prudent limits that do not needlessly hinder their ability to connect to the API in a persistent <br/>
manner.   <br/>
Such acceptable limits include technical compatibility and ensuring the application does <br/>
not pose an unacceptable level of risk to a system when connecting to an API offered by that <br/>
system, consistent with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and guidance issued by the HHS <br/>
OCR<a href="CMSs.html#39">12</a>, to which the Secretary delegated the authority to enforce HIPAA privacy and security <br/>
requirements. Organizational policies and procedures needed to comply with any additional <br/>
requirements under state laws that would apply in a given situation would also be viewed as <br/>
necessary and not anti-competitive. Examples of practices we would view as pro-competitive <br/>
might include proactively advising enrollees they are not required to use only the organization’s <br/>
own or preferred applications to access, use, and share their health information. Such advice <br/>
                                                           <br/>
12 OCR enforces federal civil rights laws, conscience and religious freedom laws, the Health Insurance Portability <br/>and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, and provisions of the <br/>Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (PSQIA) and the Patient Safety Rule (codified at 42 CFR <br/>part 3 (73 FR 70732)) protecting the confidentiality and privilege of patient safety work product as defined in <br/>PSQIA and 42 CFR Part 3.  Thus, within HHS, OCR has lead responsibility for interpreting, administering, and <br/>enforcing HIPAA regulations and developing guidance.  <br/>

would be publicly available and include information relevant to the enrollee about how they <br/>
could request access to their information through a third-party application of their choosing. <br/>
We recognize that organizations subject to the open API requirements proposed in <br/>
section III. of this proposed rule need to take reasonable and necessary steps to fulfill the <br/>
organizations’ duties under all applicable laws and regulations to protect the privacy and security <br/>
of personally identifiable information (PII), including but not limited to PHI under HIPAA as <br/>
defined at 45 CFR 160.103; those privacy and security protection obligations remain applicable <br/>
even in the context of complying with our proposal.  However, we do not believe it is <br/>
appropriate to use security and privacy concerns as an opportunity to engage in anti-competitive <br/>
practices. Anti-competitive practices might include declining to assess the technical <br/>
compatibility or security risk of an application provided to prospective enrollees by a competing <br/>
plan, despite an enrollee request to disclose their PHI to that application through the API.  <br/>
2. Privacy and Security Concerns in the Context of APIs<i><b> </b></i><br/>
We have received a wide range of stakeholder feedback on privacy and security issues in <br/>
response to prior proposals<a href="CMSs.html#40">13 </a>about policies related to APIs that would allow consumers to use <br/>
any app of their choosing to access PHI held by a HIPAA covered entity. This feedback includes <br/>
concerns about potential security risks to PHI created by an API connecting to third-party <br/>
applications.  <br/>
We appreciate these concerns. Deploying API technology that offers consumers the <br/>
opportunity to access their electronic health information that is held by a covered entity (which <br/>
includes but is not limited to MA organizations, the Medicare Part A and B programs, the <br/>
Medicaid program, CHIP, QHP issuers on the FFE, and other health plan issuers) does not lessen <br/>
the covered entity’s duties under HIPAA and other law to protect the privacy and security of <br/>
                                                           <br/>
13 For instance, see discussion of stakeholder comments in the 2015 Edition final rule at 80 FR 62676. <br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>41</b>  <br/>
information it holds, including but not limited to PHI.  A covered entity implementing an API to <br/>
enable individuals to access their health information must take reasonable steps to ensure an <br/>
individual’s information is only disclosed as permitted or required by applicable law.  The entity <br/>
must take greater care in configuring and maintaining the security functionalities of the API and <br/>
the covered entities’ electronic information systems to which it connects than would be needed if <br/>
it was implementing an API simply to allow easier access to widely available public information.   <br/>
HIPAA covered entities and their business associates continue to be responsible for <br/>
compliance with the HIPAA Rules, the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), and all other <br/>
laws applicable to their business activities including but not limited to their handling of <br/>
enrollees’ PHI and other data. As we state repeatedly throughout this proposed rule, nothing in <br/>
this proposed rule is intended to alter or should be construed as altering existing responsibilities <br/>
to protect PHI under the HIPAA Rules and requirements.  <br/>
However, we note that a number of stakeholders may believe that they are responsible for <br/>
determining whether an application to which an individual directs their PHI be disclosed applies <br/>
appropriate safeguards for the information it receives. Based on the OCR guidance discussed <br/>
below, covered entities are not responsible under the HIPAA Rules for the security of PHI once <br/>
it has been received by a third-party application chosen by an individual.  <br/>
Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule,<a href="CMSs.html#41">14</a> individuals have the right of access to inspect and <br/>
receive a copy of a defined set of their PHI as detailed at 45 CFR 164.501. Specifically, as OCR <br/>
has indicated in regulations and guidance, an individual can exercise their right of access to <br/>
direct a covered entity to send their information to a third party. When responding to an access <br/>
request, “the same requirements for providing the PHI to the individual, such as the timeliness <br/>
                                                           <br/>

requirements, fee limitations, prohibition on imposing unreasonable measures, and form and <br/>
format requirements, apply when an individual directs that the PHI be sent to another person or <br/>
entity.”<a href="CMSs.html#42">15</a> Moreover, a covered entity may not impose unreasonable measures on an individual <br/>
requesting access that serve as barriers to or unreasonably delay the individual from obtaining <br/>
access to their PHI.<a href="CMSs.html#42">16</a>  <br/>
We refer readers to further OCR guidance on related issues, including: the liability of a <br/>
covered entity in responding to an individual’s access request to send the individual’s PHI to a <br/>
third party (FAQ 2039);<a href="CMSs.html#42">17</a> individuals’ rights under HIPAA to have copies of their PHI <br/>
transferred or transmitted to them in the manner they request, even if the requested mode of <br/>
transfer or transmission is unsecure (FAQ 2060);<a href="CMSs.html#42">18 </a>and, a covered entity’s obligation under the <br/>
HIPAA Breach Notification Rule if it transmits an individual’s PHI to a third party designated by <br/>
the individual in an access request, and the entity discovers the information was breached in <br/>
transit (FAQ 2040).<a href="CMSs.html#42">19 </a> Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as explained in OCR’s interpretive <br/>
guidance, “individuals have the right under HIPAA to have copies of their PHI transferred or <br/>
transmitted to them in the manner they request … as long as the PHI is ‘readily producible’ in <br/>
the manner requested, based on the capabilities of the covered entity and transmission or transfer <br/>
in such a manner would not present an unacceptable level of security risk to the PHI on the <br/>

covered entity’s systems, such as risks that may be presented by connecting an outside system, <br/>
application, or device directly to a covered entity’s systems (as opposed to security risks to PHI <br/>
once it has left the systems)” (HIPAA FAQ 2060).<a href="CMSs.html#43">20</a> <br/>
We have also noted stakeholder concerns about protections which apply to non-covered <br/>
entities such as direct-to-consumer applications. Stakeholders, as well as covered entities who <br/>
may be required to send PHI to these applications, have noted concerns that unscrupulous actors <br/>
could deploy direct-to-consumer applications specifically in order to profit from obtaining, <br/>
using, or disclosing individuals’ PHI (and potentially other information) in ways the individual <br/>
either did not authorize or to which the individual would not knowingly consent.   <br/>
When a non–HIPAA-covered entity discloses an individual’s confidential information in <br/>
a manner or for a purpose not consistent with the privacy notice and terms of use to which the <br/>
individual agreed, the FTC has authority under the FTC Act to investigate and take action against <br/>
unfair or deceptive trade practices. The FTC has applied this authority to a wide variety of <br/>
entities. The FTC also enforces the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule, which applies to <br/>
certain types of entities that fall outside of the scope of HIPAA, and therefore, are not subject to <br/>
the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.<a href="CMSs.html#43">21</a> <br/>
We recognize that this is a complex landscape for patients, who we anticipate will want <br/>
to exercise due diligence on their own behalf in reviewing the terms of service and other <br/>
information about the applications they consider selecting. Therefore, we propose in section III. <br/>
of this proposed rule specific requirements on the payers subject to these proposed regulations to <br/>
ensure enrollees have the opportunity to become more informed about how to protect their PHI, <br/>
important things to consider in selecting an application, and where they can lodge a complaint if <br/>
                                                           <br/>

they believe a HIPAA covered entity or business associate may have breached their duties under <br/>
HIPAA or if they believe they have been subjected to unfair or deceptive actions or practices <br/>
related to a direct-to-consumer application’s privacy practices or terms of use.   <br/>
In some circumstances, information that would be required to be made available through <br/>
an API per an enrollee’s information request under this proposed rule – which we view as <br/>
consistent with the enrollee’s right of access from a covered entity under the Privacy Rule - may <br/>
not be readily transferable through the API. For instance, the covered entity may not hold certain <br/>
information electronically. However, such a scenario would in no way limit or alter <br/>
responsibilities and requirements under other law (including though not limited to HIPAA <br/>
Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules) that apply to the organizations that would be <br/>
subject to our proposed regulations. Even if the open API access requirements proposed in <br/>
section III.C. of this proposed rule were to be finalized and implemented, the organization may <br/>
still be called upon to respond to individuals’ request for information not available through the <br/>
API, or for all of their information through means other than the API. We encourage HIPAA <br/>
covered entities or business associates to review the OCR website for resources on the individual <br/>
access standard at<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html"> https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html">professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html </a>to ensure they understand their responsibilities.  <br/>
3. Specific Technical Approach and Standards <br/>
Achieving interoperability throughout the health system is essential to achieving an <br/>
effective, value-conscious health system within which consumers are able to choose from an <br/>
array of health plans and providers. An interoperable system should ensure that consumers can <br/>
both easily access their electronic health information held by plans and routinely expect that their <br/>
claims, encounter, and other relevant health history information will follow them smoothly from <br/>
plan to plan and provider to provider without burdensome requirements for them or their <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=45></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>45</b>  <br/>
providers to reassemble or re-document the information. Ready availability of health information <br/>
can be especially helpful when an individual cannot access their usual source of care, for <br/>
instance if care is needed outside their regular provider’s business hours, while traveling, or in <br/>
the wake of a natural disaster.  <br/>
The specific proposals within this rule as described in section III.C.2. would impose new <br/>
requirements on MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed <br/>
care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs (excluding issuers of SADPs) <br/>
to implement standardized, transparent APIs. Using the API, these entities would be required to <br/>
provide current and former enrollees with certain claims and encounter data and certain specific <br/>
clinical information. These entities would also be required to make available through the API <br/>
information already required to be widely available, such as provider directory and plan coverage <br/>
information. In developing our proposal delineating the information that must be available <br/>
through an API consistent with the proposed technical requirements, we were guided by an intent <br/>
to have available through the API all of the individual’s electronic health information held by the <br/>
plan in electronic format that is compatible with the API or that can, through automated means, <br/>
be accurately rendered compatible with representation through the API. We were also guided by <br/>
an intent to make available through standardized, transparent API technology all of the provider <br/>
directory and plan coverage information that is held in formats readily compatible with the API. <br/>
Both the API technology itself and the data it makes available must be standardized to <br/>
support true interoperability. Therefore, we propose in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule to <br/>
adopt both (1) content and vocabulary standards for representing electronic health information <br/>
and (2)  technical standards for an API by which the electronic health information must be made <br/>
available. For the proposals described in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule (which include <br/>
purposes <i>other than</i> a HIPAA transaction, which is required to comply with standards adopted at <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=46></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>46</b>  <br/>
45 CFR part 162), we are proposing these standards in alignment with interoperability standards <br/>
proposed for HHS adoption in ONC’s 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule  (published <br/>
elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>).  <br/>
In proposing to require use of specified standards by referencing CFR text at which <br/>
specific versions of those standards are named, we intend to preclude regulated entities from <br/>
implementing API technology using alternative technical standards to those ONC proposes for <br/>
HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215, including but not limited to proprietary standards and other <br/>
standards not widely used to exchange electronic health information in the U.S. health system.  <br/>
We further intend to preclude entities from using earlier versions of the technical standards <br/>
adopted at 45 CFR 170.215. Likewise, by proposing to require use of the content and vocabulary <br/>
standards adopted at 42 CFR 423.160 and 45 CFR part 162, and proposed at 45 CFR 170.213, <br/>
we intend to prohibit use of alternative technical standards that could potentially be used for <br/>
these same data classes and elements, as well as earlier versions of the adopted standards named <br/>
in 42 CFR 423.160, 45 CFR part 162 and proposed at 45 CFR 170.213.  <br/>
While we intend to preclude regulated entities from using content and vocabulary <br/>
standards other than those described in 42 CFR 423.160, 45 CFR part 162, or proposed 45 CFR <br/>
170.213 and 170.215, we recognize there may be circumstances which render the use of other <br/>
standards necessary. As discussed below, we propose to allow the use of other standards in two <br/>
circumstances.  First, where other content or vocabulary standards are expressly mandated by <br/>
applicable law, we would allow for use of those other mandated standards. Second, where no <br/>
appropriate content or vocabulary standard exists within 45 CFR part 162, 42 CFR 423.160, or <br/>
proposed 45 CFR 170.213 and 170.215, we would allow for use of any suitable gap-filling <br/>
standards, as may be applicable to the specific situation.  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=47></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>47</b>  <br/>
We are using two separate rulemakings because ONC’s 21st Century Cures Act proposed <br/>
rule, which includes API interoperability standards proposed for HHS adoption, would have <br/>
broader reach than the scope of this proposed rule. At the same time, we wish to assure <br/>
stakeholders that the API standards required of MA organizations, state Medicaid agencies, state <br/>
CHIP agencies, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in <br/>
FFEs under this proposal would be consistent with the API standards proposed by ONC for HHS <br/>
adoption.  <br/>
Aligning the standards requirements proposed in this rule to those proposed by ONC for <br/>
HHS adoption in ONC’s 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule will support greater <br/>
interoperability across the health care system, as health IT products and applications that will be <br/>
developed for different settings and use cases would be developed according to a consistent base <br/>
of standards that supports more seamless exchange of information. We welcome public comment <br/>
on the proposed alignment of standards in this proposed rule to those proposed for adoption by <br/>
HHS through ONC’ 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule, as well as on the best method to <br/>
provide support in identifying and implementing the applicable content and vocabulary standards <br/>
for a given data element. <br/>
Finally, while we believe that the proposed alignment of standards requirements in this <br/>
proposed rule to those proposed by ONC for HHS adoption is the best approach, we seek public <br/>
comment on an alternative by which CMS would separately adopt the proposed ONC standards <br/>
identified throughout this proposed rule, as well as future interoperability, content and <br/>
vocabulary standards. We anticipate that any such alternative would include incorporating by <br/>
reference the FHIR and OAuth technical standards and the USCDI content and vocabulary <br/>
standard (described in sections II.A.3.b. and II.A.3.a. of this proposed rule, respectively) into <br/>
CMS regulation, and replacing references to ONC regulations 45 CFR 170.215, 170.213, and <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=48></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>48</b>  <br/>
170.299, respectively. However, we specifically seek comment on whether this alternative would <br/>
present an unacceptable risk of misalignment of standards or versions of standards across HHS’ <br/>
programs, and an assessment of the benefits or burdens of separately adopting new standards and <br/>
incorporating updated versions of standards in CFR text on a program by program basis in <br/>
separate regulations. Furthermore, we seek comment on: how such an option might impact health <br/>
IT development timelines; how potential misalignment of standards over time across HHS might <br/>
impact system implementation; and other factors related to the technical aspect of implementing <br/>
these requirements.  <br/>
B. Content and Vocabulary Standards <br/>
The HHS-adopted content and vocabulary standards applicable to the data provided <br/>
through the API will vary by use case and within a use case. For instance, content and <br/>
vocabulary standards supporting consumer access vary according to what specific data elements <br/>
MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP <br/>
managed care entities, and QHP's in FFEs have available electronically. Where another law does <br/>
not require use of a specific standard, we are proposing to require use of, in effect, a catalogue of <br/>
content and vocabulary standards from which the regulated entities may choose in order to <br/>
satisfy the proposed requirements in 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 457.730, 438.252, and 457.1233, <br/>
and 45 CFR 156.221.  <br/>
We propose in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule that the applicable entity must use <br/>
certain content and vocabulary standards for data available through the API, where applicable to <br/>
the data type or data element, unless an alternate standard is required by other applicable law. <br/>
Specifically, we propose the applicable entity must use:  <br/>

(USCDI Version 1) where such standards are the only available standards for the data type or <br/>
element;  <br/>
●  HIPAA Administrative Simplification transaction standards under 45 CFR part 162 or <br/>

applicable law, or where such standards are the only available standards for the data type or <br/>

CFR part 162 or 42 CFR 423.160 standard or the USCDI Version 1 standard at 45 CFR 170.213, <br/>
the applicable entity may use any of these content and vocabulary standards as determined <br/>
appropriate for the data type or element. We describe these proposals in more detail below. <br/>
First, we propose in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule to require use of the content <br/>
and vocabulary standard ONC proposes for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.213 as applicable to <br/>
the data type or data element.  The USCDI Version 1 data set includes data classes that can be <br/>
supported by commonly used standards, and establishes a minimum set of data classes that <br/>
would be required to be interoperable nationwide.<a href="CMSs.html#49">22</a>  The USCDI is designed to be expanded in <br/>
an iterative and predictable way over time. On behalf of HHS, ONC has proposed to adopt the <br/>
USCDI as a standard in its 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule (published elsewhere in this <br/>
<b>Federal Register</b>). The USCDI Version 1 data set proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 <br/>
CFR 170.213 also includes the standards referenced by certification criteria adopted in 45 CFR <br/>
part 170, to which health IT, such as Health IT Modules presented for certification under ONC’s <br/>
Health IT Certification Program, must conform. Developers of applications are already familiar <br/>
with and commonly using these standards in products that interact with ONC-certified health IT. <br/>
                                                           <br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>50</b>  <br/>
The payer and purchaser communities are also aware of and commonly using the 45 CFR part <br/>
170 standards, and many members of these communities actively participate in health-data-<br/>
focused standards development organizations responsible for the creation of these standards. As <br/>
a result, we believe that the adoption and implementation of these standards for CMS’ programs <br/>
should not add new burdens to the industry. All standards adopted within 45 CFR part 170, <br/>
including the USCDI standard ONC proposes for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.213, are, or are <br/>
proposed by ONC to be incorporated by reference by HHS, at 45 CFR 170.299. (published <br/>
elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>). <br/>
Second, we propose to require that entities use standards specified at 45 CFR part 162 for <br/>
HIPAA transactions as required by applicable law, as well as the standards specified at 42 CFR <br/>
423.160 for Part D e-prescribing transactions, as required by applicable law. We reiterate that <br/>
this proposed rule would not alter these other regulations, and should not be construed as altering <br/>
any organization’s compliance requirements for these other regulations. The standards proposed <br/>
in this regulation are intended for instances where other statutes and regulations do not dictate <br/>
the standard by which regulated parties are to convey or otherwise make available electronic <br/>
information.  <br/>
Where there is no legally mandated standard applicable to a specific data type or data <br/>
element in a particular exchange context, and the HIPAA Administrative Simplification <br/>
transaction standards under 45 CFR part 162 or the Part D e-prescribing transaction standards at <br/>
42 CFR 423.160 are the only standards available for a specific data element or type, we propose <br/>
to require entities subject to these proposals to use these HIPAA standards when making data <br/>
available through the API. We further clarify that, for purposes of formatting, making available, <br/>
and sending electronic data under this proposed rule, we would require use of:  (1) the content <br/>
and vocabulary standards identified in 45 CFR part 162 regardless of whether the entities are <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=51></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>51</b>  <br/>
covered entities, and (2) the part D e-prescribing standards in 42 CFR 423.160 to exchange e-<br/>
prescribing and related data (such as drug formulary and preferred drug list data) regardless of <br/>
whether they are conducting a part D e-prescribing transaction,.  <br/>
Third, in information exchanges where applicable law does not mandate a certain <br/>
standard and where a specific data type or element might be encoded or formatted using the 45 <br/>
CFR part 162 or 42 CFR 423.160 standard, or the USCDI Version 1 standard at 45 CFR <br/>
170.213, we propose in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule that the regulated entities subject <br/>
to our proposal would have the freedom to provide data through the API that complies with any <br/>
of these format or encoding standards. Specifically, we believe payers should use standards that <br/>
are most efficient and effective based on their existing systems, data mapping considerations, or <br/>
those standards that best meets enrollees’ needs, while remaining technically practicable for use <br/>
in conjunction with API technology conformant to the 45 CFR 170.215 proposed standards  <br/>
(published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>), and so long as such action is in accordance with <br/>
applicable laws. For example, for data types for which 45 CFR part 162 standards are the only <br/>
ones widely used throughout the payer community, and for specific content that payers typically <br/>
only receive according to these HIPAA standards, we believe use of the 45 CFR part 162 content <br/>
standards to represent the information is appropriate and efficient at this juncture. We note that <br/>
for data made available through the API, entities subject to this proposal would be required to <br/>
use the standards identified in this proposal even if the exact information to be exchanged <br/>
through the API is also required to be available through other mechanisms.   <br/>
Finally, we encourage payers or plans to implement additional, widely used, consensus-<br/>
based standards identified by other means—such as by HHS for other purposes or through a <br/>
consensus standards development organization—for additional data in their information systems <br/>
for which no standard is adopted at 45 CFR part 162, 42 CFR 423.160, or 45 CFR 170.213 to the <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=52></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b>52</b>  <br/>
extent feasible, while maintaining compatibility with the required API technical standards. We <br/>
also encourage entities to pilot emerging standards identified by HHS, or by a consensus <br/>
standards development organization through development or approval for trial use, where such a <br/>
pilot maintains compatibility with the proposed API technical standards. However, MA <br/>
organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP agencies, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed <br/>
care entities, and QHPs in FFEs that choose to make non-standardized data available through <br/>
their APIs would be required to ensure that their API documentation provides sufficient <br/>
information to an application developer for their applications to handle this information <br/>
accurately and automatically. We welcome public comment on these proposals.  <br/>
C.  API Standard <br/>
In section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule, we propose to adopt a standard for the API in <br/>
alignment with the API technical standard proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR <br/>
170.215 (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>).  By cross-reference to 45 CFR 170.215, <br/>
we are effectively proposing in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule to require use of the <br/>
foundational Health Level 7 (HL7®)<a href="CMSs.html#52">23 </a>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) <br/>
standard,<a href="CMSs.html#52">24</a> several implementation specifications specific to FHIR, and complementary security <br/>
and app registration protocols (OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Core).  <br/>
The FHIR standard holds great potential for supporting interoperability and enabling new <br/>
entrants and competition throughout the health care industry. FHIR leverages modern computing <br/>
techniques to enable users to access health care “resources” over the internet via a standardized <br/>
RESTful API. Developers can create tools that interact with FHIR APIs to provide actionable <br/>
                                                           <br/>
23 Health Level Seven International (HL7®) is a not-for-profit, ANSI-accredited standards development organization <br/>(SDO) focused on developing consensus standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic <br/>health information that supports clinical practice and the management, delivery and evaluation of health services.  <br/>Learn more at<a href="http://www.hl7.org/about/index.cfm?ref=nav"> “About HL7” </a>web page, last accessed 06/27/2018.)  <br/>24<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html"> https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html.</a>  <br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b>53</b>  <br/>
data to their stakeholders. In the short time since FHIR was first created, the health care industry <br/>
has rapidly embraced the standard through substantial investments in industry pilots, <br/>
specification development, and the deployment of FHIR APIs supporting a variety of business <br/>
needs. With the exception of the API Resource Collection in Health (ARCH) (proposed by ONC <br/>
for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215(a)(2)), the API technology standards and implementation <br/>
specifications proposed at 45 CFR 170.215 (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>) are <br/>
consensus technical standards that, under the National Technology Transfer &amp; Advancement Act <br/>
of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-113, enacted March 7, 1996) and OMB Circular No. A-119, are, where <br/>
available and their use not impracticable, preferred for use in government programs over both <br/>
government-unique standards and standards developed using less rigorous consensus processes. <br/>
We note that while all APIs that would be used by software applications to provide <br/>
consumers access to their electronic health information would be required to adhere to the <br/>
foundational FHIR standard, and other essential standards such as security protocols applicable <br/>
to the data exchanged, we do not anticipate that all of the standards, implementation <br/>
specifications, and protocols proposed at 45 CFR 170.215 will be directly relevant to every use <br/>
case reflected within the policies proposed in this rule. For example, authenticating end users’ <br/>
identities may not be needed where the information requested and released to an application <br/>
through the API is limited to information otherwise published, such as provider directory <br/>
information otherwise required by the programs’ regulations to be made widely available.   <br/>
We note that an API implemented by regulated entities described in section III.C. of this <br/>
proposed rule is not required to be certified by ONC under the ONC Health IT Certification <br/>
Program for the related certification criteria.  Furthermore, because the data required to be made <br/>
available by an API as proposed in section III.C. of this proposed rule includes information <br/>
beyond the USCDI Version 1 data set (proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=54></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>54</b>  <br/>
170.213), certification to the ONC certification criteria at 45 CFR 170.215 would not alone be <br/>
sufficient to ensure the API’s capacity to support the full range of data elements required under <br/>
the proposal in section III.C. of this proposed rule.  <br/>
Finally, we are aware that the implementation specifications currently proposed by ONC <br/>
for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215  (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>), in <br/>
complement to the base FHIR foundational standards, leave substantial work to be done by <br/>
health IT developers and their customers to build and deploy technology to support the proposals <br/>
described in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule. Supplemental technical resources to support <br/>
efficient and successful implementation of the foundational FHIR standard can be developed by <br/>
a variety of organizations. However, we recognize that there may be fewer applicable resources <br/>
to support the development required under this rule. Thus, HHS expects to provide organizations <br/>
subject to the policies proposed in this proposed rule with technical assistance and subregulatory <br/>
guidance that incorporates feedback from industry. We recommend readers review ONC’s 21st <br/>
Century Cures Act proposed rule to fully understand the scope and detail of the API standard and <br/>
content and vocabulary standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption which apply to the <br/>
proposals included in this proposed rule. We further recommend readers review the publicly <br/>
available resources available on the HL7 FHIR standard <br/>
<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html">(https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html)</a> and the USCDI Version 1 standard <br/>
(https://www.healthit.gov/USCDI) respectively.  These publicly available materials will inform <br/>
readers understanding of the requirements under this proposed rule and, we expect, will also <br/>
assist stakeholders in drafting comments submitted within this rulemaking proceeding.    <br/>
As noted in our proposal in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule, we have determined to <br/>
align our proposal to the types of data, technology use, and available standards that are consistent <br/>
with an overall HHS approach to support interoperability while mitigating provider and <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=55></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>55</b>  <br/>
developer burden. We hope to see continued innovation and advancement in standards <br/>
development for identified gaps in health information data classes and data elements, as well as <br/>
improved bi-directional patient engagement functionalities. For example, we are not proposing to <br/>
require that organizations subject to the requirements proposed in section III.C. of this proposed <br/>
rule offer patients or providers the ability through the API to write information directly to patient <br/>
records held by the organization. However, we hope that organizations and their health IT <br/>
developers build on the API technology we do propose to require and accelerate innovation <br/>
responsive to providers’ and patients’ calls for API write functionality at the fastest pace <br/>
practicable given the maturity of needed standards. We believe this innovation may be fostered <br/>
by the concrete steps forward in data exchange and API capabilities we are proposing to require <br/>
across the significant segment of payers subject to this proposed rule.   <br/>
D. Updates to Standards <br/>
In addition to our efforts to align standards across HHS, we recognize that while we must <br/>
codify in regulation a specific version of each standard, the need for continually evolving <br/>
standards development has historically outpaced our ability to amend regulatory text.  In order to <br/>
address how standards development can outpace our rulemaking schedule, we propose in section <br/>
III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule that regulated entities may use updated versions of required <br/>
standards if use of the updated version is required by other applicable law.  <br/>
In addition, under certain circumstances, we propose to allow use of an updated version <br/>
of a standard if the standard is not prohibited under other applicable law. Where a single standard <br/>
is updated more than once in a brief period of time and upon review of the standard HHS <br/>
determines that – to reduce fragmentation and preserve efficacy – only the latest of the updated <br/>
versions should be used  We will publish subregulatory guidance to that effect.   <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=56></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>56</b>  <br/>
For content and vocabulary standards at 45 CFR part 162 or 42 CFR 423.160, we propose <br/>
to allow the use of an updated version of the content or vocabulary standard adopted under this <br/>
rulemaking, unless the use of the updated version of the standard is prohibited for entities <br/>
regulated by that part or the program under that section, or prohibited by the Secretary for <br/>
purposes of these policies or for use in ONC’s Health IT Certification Program, or is precluded <br/>
by other applicable law.   <br/>
For the content and vocabulary standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR <br/>
170.213 (USCDI Version 1),<a href="CMSs.html#56">25 </a>as well as for API interoperability standards proposed by ONC <br/>
for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (including HL7 FHIR and other standards discussed <br/>
above),<a href="CMSs.html#56">26</a> we propose to allow the use of an updated version of a standard adopted under this <br/>
rulemaking, provided such updated version has been approved by the National Coordinator <br/>
through the standards version advancement process described in ONC’s 21st Century Cures Act <br/>
proposed rule (published elsewhere in the <b>Federal Register</b>).  <br/>
As described in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule, under the proposed ONC <br/>
Standards Version Advancement Process, ONC would allow health IT developers participating <br/>
in the ONC Health IT certification program to voluntarily use updated versions of adopted <br/>
standards in their certified Health IT Modules, so long as certain conditions are met. The <br/>
proposed Standards Version Advancement Process flexibility gives health IT developers the <br/>
option to avoid unnecessary costs and is expected to help reduce market confusion by enabling <br/>
certified Health IT Modules to keep pace with standards advancement and market needs. Once a <br/>
standard has been adopted for use in ONC’s Health IT Certification Program through notice and <br/>
comment rulemaking, ONC would undertake an annual, open and transparent process, including <br/>
                                                           <br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>57</b>  <br/>
opportunity for public comment, to timely ascertain whether a more recent version of that <br/>
standard or implementation specification should be approved for developers’ voluntary use. <br/>
ONC expects to use an expanded section of the Interoperability Standards Advisory (ISA) web <br/>
platform to facilitate the public transparency and engagement process, and to publish each year’s <br/>
final list of National Coordinator-approved advanced versions that health IT developers could <br/>
elect to use consistent with the Standards Version Advancement Process. (For more detail, please <br/>
see section VIII.B.5. of ONC’s 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule (published elsewhere in <br/>
this <b>Federal Register</b>).) We believe that permitting the use of updates to standards at 45 CFR <br/>
170.213 and 170.215 consistent with the ONC Standards Version Advancement Process will <br/>
enhance alignment and foster improved interoperability across the health system.   <br/>
In providing flexibility to the plans and payers that will be required to implement APIs <br/>
that use the content and vocabulary standards identified in the regulation text, we also believe it <br/>
is important to maintain compatibility and avoid a disruption or reduction in data availability to <br/>
the end user. Entities subject to the proposed regulations seeking to use an updated version of a <br/>
standard must consider factors such as the impact of differences between standards versions and <br/>
the potential burden on developers and end users to support transitioning between versions. We <br/>
expect that these practical considerations to maintain compatibility and avoid disruption will <br/>
discourage premature use of new versions of a standard.   <br/>
Therefore, we propose in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule that an entity may use an <br/>
updated version of a required standard so long as use of the updated version does not disrupt an <br/>
end user’s ability to access the data available through the API proposed in section III. of this <br/>
proposed rule. Entities that would be required to implement an open API under this rulemaking <br/>
would be free to upgrade to newer versions of the required standards, subject only to those <br/>
limiting conditions noted here, at any pace they wish. However, they must continue to support <br/>

<b>58</b>  <br/>
connectivity, and make the same data available, for end users using applications that have been <br/>
built to support only the adopted version(s) of the API standards. <br/>
 <br/>
We welcome public comment on this proposed approach to allow voluntary use of <br/>
updated versions of the standards ultimately adopted through this rulemaking.  <br/>
<b>III. Patient Access Through APIs </b><br/>
A. Background on Medicare Blue Button <br/>
We are committed to advancing interoperability, putting patients at the center of their <br/>
health care, and ensuring they have simple and easy access, without special effort, to their health <br/>
information. With the establishment of the initial Medicare Blue Button® service in 2010, <br/>
Medicare beneficiaries became able to download their Part A, Part B, and Part D health care <br/>
claims data through MyMedicare.gov in either PDF or text format. While the original Blue <br/>
Button effort was a first step towards liberating patient health information, we recognize that <br/>
significant opportunities remain to modernize access to that health information and the ability to <br/>
share health information across the health ecosystem. We believe that moving to a system in <br/>
which patients have access to and use of their health information will empower them to make <br/>
better informed decisions about their health care. Additionally, interoperability, and the ability <br/>
for health information systems and software applications to communicate, exchange, and <br/>
interpret health information in a usable and readable format, is vital to improving health care. <br/>
Allowing access to health information only through PDF and text format limits the utility and <br/>
sharing of the health information. <br/>
Medicare Blue Button 2.0 is a new, modernized version of the original Blue Button <br/>
service. It enables beneficiaries to access their Medicare Parts A, B, and D claims data and share <br/>
that electronic health information through an Application Program Interface (API) with <br/>
applications, services, and research programs they select. As discussed in more detail in section <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=59></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>59</b>  <br/>
II.A. of this proposed rule, API technology allows software from different developers to connect <br/>
with one another and exchange electronic health information in electronic formats that can be <br/>
more easily compiled and leveraged by patients and their caregivers. Beneficiaries may also <br/>
select third-party applications to compile and leverage their electronic health information to help <br/>
them manage their health and engage in a more fully informed way in their health care. <br/>
Medicare Blue Button 2.0 is expected to foster increased competition among technology <br/>
innovators who serve Medicare patients and their caregivers, such as through finding better ways <br/>
to use claims data to address their health needs. Patients should have the ability to access their <br/>
health information, in a format of their choosing, to receive a full picture of their health records. <br/>
API technology can be an effective way to share data because health information from various <br/>
sources can be retrieved through these secure interfaces and consolidated by a single tool, such <br/>
as a third-party application chosen by, in the case of Medicare, the beneficiary or their caregiver. <br/>
The Medicare Blue Button 2.0 API is also expected to improve the Medicare beneficiary <br/>
experience by providing beneficiaries secure access to their claims data in a standardized, <br/>
computable format. We recognize that data security is of the utmost importance and are <br/>
dedicated to safeguarding patient health information so that only the beneficiary and their <br/>
authorized personal representative would have the ability to authorize release of their health <br/>
information through Medicare Blue Button 2.0 to a third-party software application.   <br/>
Medicare Blue Button 2.0 will provide beneficiaries with a longitudinal view of their <br/>
Medicare claims data, which can then be combined with other health information within third <br/>
party applications.  One benefit of making records available via an API is that it enables a <br/>
beneficiary to pull Medicare health information along with other heath information into a single <br/>
application not dictated by any specific health plan, provider, or portal. APIs allow health <br/>
information to move through the health ecosystem with the patient and ensure comprehensive <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=60></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>60</b>  <br/>
and timely information is accessible even if the patient changes health plans, providers, or both <br/>
over time, facilitating continuity of care.   <br/>
B. Expanding the Availability of Health Information  <br/>
1.  Benefits of Information Access  <br/>
We believe there are numerous benefits associated with individuals having simple and <br/>
easy access to their health care data under a standard that is widely used. Claims and encounter <br/>
data, used in conjunction with EHR data, can offer a broader and more holistic understanding of <br/>
an individual’s interactions with the health care system than EHR data alone. For example, <br/>
inconsistent benefit utilization patterns in an individual’s claims data, such as a failure to fill a <br/>
prescription or receive recommended therapies, can indicate that the individual has had difficulty <br/>
adhering to a treatment regimen and may require less expensive prescription drugs or therapies, <br/>
additional explanation about the severity of their condition, or other types of assistance. <br/>
Identifying and finding opportunities to address the individual’s non-adherence to a care plan are <br/>
critical to keeping people with chronic conditions healthy and engaged so they can avoid <br/>
hospitalizations. While a health plan can use claims and encounter data to help it identify which <br/>
enrollees could benefit from an assessment of why they are not filling their prescriptions or who <br/>
might be at risk for particular problems, putting this information into the hands of the <br/>
individual’s chosen care provider – such as the doctor or nurse practitioner prescribing the <br/>
medications or the pharmacist who fills the prescriptions – helps them to engage the patient in <br/>
shared decision making that can help address some of the reasons the individual might not be <br/>
willing or able to take medications as prescribed. By authorizing their providers to access the <br/>
same information through the open API, individuals can further facilitate communication with <br/>
their care teams. Enabling the provider to integrate claims and encounter information with EHR <br/>
data gives the provider the ability to use the combined information, with relevant clinical <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=61></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>61</b>  <br/>
decision support tools, as part of normal care delivery in a less burdensome way, leading to <br/>
improved care. This may be particularly important during times of system surge, for example, in <br/>
the event of an event that generates a large and sudden demand for health services, when access <br/>
to such information may help to inform patient triage, transfer, and care decisions. <br/>
Further, consumers who have immediate electronic access to their health information are <br/>
empowered to make more informed decisions when discussing their health needs with providers, <br/>
or when considering changing to a different health plan. In many cases, claims and encounter <br/>
data can provide a more holistic and comprehensive view of a patient’s care history than EHR <br/>
data alone. Whereas EHR data is frequently locked in closed, disparate health systems, care and <br/>
treatment information in the form of claims and encounter data is comprehensively combined in <br/>
a patient’s claims and billing history. Currently, not all beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans have <br/>
immediate electronic access to their claims and encounter data and those who do have it, cannot <br/>
easily share it with providers or others. The same is true of Medicaid beneficiaries and CHIP <br/>
enrollees, whether enrolled in FFS or managed care programs, and enrollees in QHPs in FFEs. <br/>
As industries outside of health care continue to integrate multiple sources of data to understand <br/>
and predict their consumers’ needs, we believe it is important to position MA organizations, <br/>
Medicaid and CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs to do the same to encourage <br/>
competition, innovation, and value. Further, we believe that beneficiaries in Medicaid FFS <br/>
programs administered by state Medicaid agencies and CHIP enrollees in both FFS and managed <br/>
care should benefit from similar advances and the benefits of innovation and value.  <br/>
CMS has programmatic authority over MA organizations, Medicaid programs (both FFS <br/>
and managed care), CHIP (including FFS and managed care), and QHP issuers in FFEs.  This <br/>
proposed rule seeks to leverage that CMS authority to make claims and encounter data available <br/>
to patients in these programs along with other plan data (such as provider directory data) as <br/>

detailed in sections III.C. and IV. of this proposed rule. We propose that regulated entities make <br/>
this data available in a standardized format and through a specific technological means so that <br/>
third parties can develop and make available applications that make the data available for patient <br/>
use in a convenient and timely manner. Our proposal would require use of specific <br/>
interoperability standards adopted by the Secretary in implementing and complying with the <br/>
proposed requirement to use an API to make this data available. We are proposing to require, by <br/>
cross-reference to 45 CFR 170.215, the same API technical standards that ONC is proposing for <br/>
HHS adoption in its 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal </b><br/>
<b>Register</b>). We are also proposing to require that the data elements made available through the <br/>
proposed API technology must be formatted and presented in accordance with applicable content <br/>
and vocabulary standards as described in section II. of this proposed rule. This means that the <br/>
software receiving and using the data can readily consume the data to support consumer-friendly <br/>
display and other functionalities.  <br/>
Ultimately, the goal of this proposal is to require that patient data be made available in a <br/>
standardized format through an API, so that third parties can develop and offer applications that <br/>
make the data available in a convenient and timely manner for enrollees and beneficiaries in MA <br/>
plans, Medicaid and CHIP FFS and managed care delivery systems, and FFEs that are specified <br/>
in our proposal as detailed below.  <br/>
2.  Alignment with the HIPAA Right of Access <br/>
The HIPAA Privacy Rule, at 45 CFR 164.524, provides that individuals have a right of <br/>
access to inspect and obtain a copy of PHI, defined at 45 CFR 160.103, about them that is <br/>
maintained by a health plan or covered health care provider in a designated record set, defined at <br/>
45 CFR 164.501. The right of access also provides individuals with the right to initiate <br/>
disclosures to third parties.  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=63></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>63</b>  <br/>
Software applications using the API proposed in 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 438.242(b)(6), <br/>
457.730, 457.1233(d)(2), and 45 CFR 156.221 would provide an additional mechanism through <br/>
which the individuals in that coverage who so choose can exercise the HIPAA right of access to <br/>
their PHI, by giving them a simple and easy electronic way to request, receive, and share data <br/>
that they want and need, including with a designated third party. However, as discussed in <br/>
section II of this proposed rule, due to limitations in current availability of interoperability <br/>
standards for some types of data and patient’s rights to be granted access in the form and manner <br/>
of their own choosing, the API requirement may not be sufficient to support access to all of the <br/>
health information subject to the HIPAA right of access because it may not all be transferable <br/>
through the API.   <br/>
C. Open API Proposal for MA, Medicaid, CHIP, and QHP issuers in FFEs <br/>
1.  Introduction <br/>
We are proposing to add new provisions at 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 438.242(b)(6),  <br/>
457.730, 457.1233(d) and 45 CFR 156.221, that would, respectively, require MA organizations, <br/>
state Medicaid FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP FFS programs, CHIP <br/>
managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs (excluding issuers of SADPs) to implement, <br/>
test, and monitor an openly-published API that is accessible to third-party applications and <br/>
developers. We note that states with CHIPs are not required to operate FFS systems and that <br/>
some states’ CHIPs are exclusively operated by managed care entities. We do not intend to <br/>
require CHIPs that do not operate a FFS program to establish an API; rather, these states may <br/>
rely on their contracted plans, referred to throughout this proposed rule as CHIP managed care <br/>
entities, to set up such a system.    <br/>
The API would allow enrollees and beneficiaries of MA organizations, Medicaid and <br/>
CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=64></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>64</b>  <br/>
issuers in FFEs to exercise electronically their HIPAA right of access to certain health <br/>
information specific to their plan, through the use of common technologies and without special <br/>
effort. Common technologies, for purposes of our proposal, are those that are widely used and <br/>
readily available, such as computers, smartphones or tablets. <br/>
We are proposing that the API would be required to meet certain interoperability <br/>
standards, consistent with the API technical standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption  in its <br/>
proposed rule (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>), as well as to require the use of <br/>
content and vocabulary standards adopted by HHS and that the use of these standards would be <br/>
applicable across the specific entities subject to proposed 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, <br/>
438.242(b)(6), 457.730, and 457.1233(d), and 45 CFR 156.221. In this context, these standards <br/>
are critical to ensure that enrollees of those plans and programs have electronic access to their <br/>
health information in interoperable form and that access to their health information and <br/>
information about their coverage are not obstructed by, or confined to, certain propriety systems. <br/>
Under our proposal, the scope and volume of the information to be provided or made <br/>
accessible through the open API would include:  adjudicated claims (including cost); encounters <br/>
with capitated providers; provider remittances; enrollee cost-sharing; and clinical data, including <br/>
laboratory results (where available). We propose that these programs and organizations, with the <br/>
exception of the QHP issuers in FFEs, would also be required to make information regarding <br/>
provider directories and formularies available through the open API. Sections 1852(c), <br/>
1932(a)(5), and 2103(f)(3) of the Act require that MA organizations and Medicaid MCOs, and <br/>
CHIP managed care entities provide basic information to their enrollees on how to get covered <br/>
benefits in the plan and to facilitate decision making about plan choice, providers, and benefits. <br/>
These statutory provisions indicate information enrollees could use to make decisions about their <br/>
health care. The API proposals at 42 CFR 422.119(a), 438.242(b)(6), and 457.1233(d) support <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=65></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>65</b>  <br/>
and complement existing implementation of these provisions in a robust and modern way. We <br/>
believe the health information that would be available through the proposed API would greatly <br/>
supplement the benefit, provider directory, and, if applicable, formulary information from states <br/>
and managed care plans by providing important details and context, thus enabling enrollees to <br/>
make more informed, proactive decisions.  <br/>
Additionally, we believe that since most of the information required to be provided by <br/>
these statutory sections of the Act, such as the provider directory, is currently accessible to <br/>
enrollees and potential enrollees electronically online, making such standardized health <br/>
information available through the proposed API could allow easy integration for use by more <br/>
enrollees. Further, the proposal would enable these enrollees to more easily share their <br/>
information with providers, family, caregivers, and others. As a general matter, providing <br/>
important details and context to patients gives them more visibility into their treatment record <br/>
through adjudicated claims, allowing them to be true partners in their health care. This goal is <br/>
related to the disclosure requirements in sections 1852, 1932 and 2103 of the Act and our <br/>
proposal furthers each.   <br/>
We also believe the proposed API allows for the administration of more efficient and <br/>
effective Medicaid and CHIP programs by taking advantage of commonly used methods of <br/>
information sharing and data standardization. Consumers routinely perform many daily tasks on <br/>
their mobile phones – banking, shopping, paying bills, scheduling – using secure applications. <br/>
We believe that obtaining their health information should be just as easy, convenient, and user-<br/>
friendly. Our proposal is a step toward that vision for enrollees in MA plans, Medicaid FFS and <br/>
managed care programs, CHIP FFS programs and managed care entities, and QHPs in FFEs. <br/>
Finally, our proposal includes a number of parameters and standards for the API and for <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=66></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>66</b>  <br/>
adopting, implementing, testing, and monitoring the API; the specific pieces of our proposal are <br/>
addressed in turn in sections III.C.2 of this proposed rule. <br/>
2.  The Open API Proposal <br/>
This section outlines the components of the open API proposal. Specifically, this section <br/>
will discuss:  <br/>
●  Authority to require implementation of an open API; <br/>
●  The API technical standard and content and vocabulary standards; <br/>
●  Data Required to be Available Through the Open API &amp; Timeframes for Data <br/>
Availability; <br/>
●  Documentation Requirements for APIs;  <br/>
●  Routine Testing and Monitoring of Open APIs; <br/>
●  Compliance with Existing Privacy and Security Requirements; <br/>
●  Denial or Discontinuation of Access to the API; <br/>
●  Enrollee and Beneficiary Resources Regarding Privacy and Security; <br/>
●  Exceptions or Provisions Specific to Certain Programs or Sub-Programs; <br/>
●  Applicability and Timing; and  <br/>
●  Request for Information on Information Sharing Between Payers and Providers <br/>
Through APIs. <br/>
We are proposing nearly identical language for the regulations requiring open APIs at 42 <br/>
CFR 422.119; 431.60, and 457.730 and 45 CFR 156.221 for MA organizations, Medicaid state <br/>
agencies, state CHIP agencies, and QHPs in FFEs; Medicaid managed care plans would be <br/>
required at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6), to comply with the requirement at 42 CFR 431.60, and CHIP <br/>
managed care entities would be required by 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) to comply with the <br/>
requirement at 42 CFR 457.730. As discussed in detail in this proposed rule, we are proposing <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=67></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>67</b>  <br/>
similar if not identical requirements for these various entities to establish and maintain an open <br/>
API, make specified data available through that API, disclose API documentation, provide <br/>
access to the API, and make resources available to enrollees. We believe that such nearly <br/>
identical text is appropriate here as the reasons and need for the proposal and the associated <br/>
requirements are the same across these programs. Except as noted below with regard to specific <br/>
proposals, we intend to interpret and apply the regulations proposed in this section, III.C. of this <br/>
proposed rule, similarly and starting with similar text is an important step to communicate that to <br/>
the applicable entities that would be required to comply. <br/>
In paragraph (a) of each of the proposed regulations, we propose that the regulated entity <br/>
(that is, the MA organization, the State Medicaid or CHIP agency, the Medicaid managed care <br/>
plan, the CHIP managed care entity or the QHP in an FFE, as applicable) would be required to <br/>
implement and maintain an open API that permits third-party applications to retrieve, with the <br/>
approval and at the direction of the individual beneficiary, data specified in paragraph (b) of each <br/>
regulation through the use of common technologies and without special effort from the <br/>
beneficiary. By “common technologies and without special effort” by the enrollee, we mean use <br/>
of common consumer technologies, like smart phones, home computers, laptops or tablets, to <br/>
request, receive, use and approve transfer of the data that would be available through the open <br/>
API technology. By “without special effort,” we codify our expectation that third-party software, <br/>
as well as proprietary applications and web portals operated by the payer could be used to <br/>
connect to the API and provide access to the data to the enrollee. In our proposed regulations, we <br/>
address the data that must be made available through the API in paragraph (b); the technical <br/>
standards for the API and the data it contains in paragraph (c); the documentation requirements <br/>
for the API in paragraph (d); explicit authority for the payer regulated under each regulation to <br/>
deny or discontinue access to the API in paragraph (e); and requirements for posting information <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=68></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>68</b>  <br/>
about resources on security and privacy for beneficiaries in paragraphs (f) or (g). Additional <br/>
requirements specific to each program, discussed in sections IV. and V of this proposed rule, are <br/>
also included in some of the regulations that address the API. <br/>
We solicit comment on our use of virtually identical language in these regulations and <br/>
our overall proposal to require implementation and maintenance of an open API. <br/>
a.  Authority to Require Implementation of an open API <br/>
Our proposal would apply to MA organizations, Medicaid state agencies and managed <br/>
care plans, state CHIP agencies and managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs. We note <br/>
that our proposal for Medicaid managed care plans, at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6), would require <br/>
MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs to comply with the regulation that we are proposing for Medicaid <br/>
state agencies at 42 CFR 431.60 as if that regulation applied to the Medicaid managed care plan. <br/>
Similarly, we intend for CHIP managed care entities to comply with the requirements we <br/>
propose at 42 CFR 457.730 via the regulations proposed at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2). We propose <br/>
to structure the regulations this way to avoid ambiguity and to ensure that this API proposal <br/>
would result in consistent access to information for Medicaid beneficiaries and CHIP enrollees, <br/>
regardless of whether they are in a FFS delivery system administered by the state or in a <br/>
managed care delivery system.  CHIP currently adopts the Medicaid requirements at 42 CFR <br/>
438.242 in whole. We propose revisions to 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(1) to indicate CHIP’s continued <br/>
adoption of 42 CFR 438.242(a), (b)(1) through (5), (c), (d), and (e), while proposing specific text <br/>
for CHIP managed care entities to comply with the regulations proposed at 42 CFR <br/>
457.1233(d)(2) in lieu of the proposed Medicaid revision, which would add 42 CFR <br/>
438.242(b)(6). In our discussion of the specifics of this proposal and how we propose to codify it <br/>
at 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 457.730, and 45 CFR 156.221, we refer only generally to 42 CFR <br/>
438.242(b)(6) and 457.1233(d)(2) for this reason. <br/>

(1) Medicare Advantage <br/>
Sections 1856(b) and 1857(e) of the Act provide CMS with the authority to add standards <br/>
and requirements for MA organizations that the Secretary finds necessary and appropriate and <br/>
not inconsistent with Part C of the Medicare statute; section 1852(c) of the Act requires <br/>
disclosure by MA organizations of specific information about the plan, covered benefits, and the <br/>
network of providers; section 1852(h) of the Act requires MA organizations to provide their <br/>
enrollees with timely access to medical records and health information insofar as MA <br/>
organizations maintain such information. As technology evolves to allow for faster, more <br/>
efficient methods of information transfer, so do expectations as to what is generally considered <br/>
“timely.” Currently, consumers across public and private sectors have become increasingly <br/>
accustomed to accessing a broad range of personal records, such as bank statements, credit <br/>
scores, and voter registrations, immediately through electronic means and with updates received <br/>
in near real time. Thus, we believe that in order to align our standards with 21st century demands, <br/>
we must take steps for MA enrollees to have immediate, electronic access to their health <br/>
information and plan information. The proposed requirements in this rule are intended to achieve <br/>
this goal. <br/>
We believe that the scope of the information that would be made available through an <br/>
API under this proposal (described in section III. of this proposed rule) is consistent with the <br/>
access and disclosure requirements in section 1852 of the Act, and we rely on our authority in <br/>
sections 1856(b) and 1857(e) of the Act, which provide CMS with the authority to add standards <br/>
and requirements for MA organizations, to require MA organizations to make specific types of <br/>
information, at minimum, accessible through an open API and require timeframes for update <br/>
cycles. Throughout this section III.C. of this proposed rule, we explain how and why the open <br/>
API proposal is necessary and appropriate for MA organizations and the MA program; the goals <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=70></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>70</b>  <br/>
and purposes of achieving interoperability for the health care system as a whole are equally <br/>
applicable to MA organizations and their enrollees; thus, the discussion in section II of this <br/>
proposed rule serves to provide further explanation as to how an open API proposal is necessary <br/>
and appropriate in the MA program.  Further, having easy access to their claims, encounter, and <br/>
other health information would also facilitate beneficiaries’ ability to detect and report fraud, <br/>
waste, and abuse – a critical component of an effective program. <br/>
To the extent necessary, we also rely on section 1860D-12(b)(3) of the Act to add <br/>
provisions specific to the Part D benefit offered by certain MA organizations. For MA <br/>
organizations that offer MA Prescription Drug plans, we are proposing requirements in 42 CFR <br/>
422.119(b)(2) regarding electronic health information for Part D coverage. That aspect of our <br/>
proposal is also supported by the disclosure requirements imposed under section 1860D-4(a) of <br/>
the Act, which requires Part D claims information, pharmacy directory information, and <br/>
formulary information to be disclosed to enrollees. <br/>
(2)  Medicaid and CHIP <br/>
We are proposing new provisions at 42 CFR 431.60(a), 457.730, 438.242(b)(6), and <br/>
457.1233(d)(2) that would require states administering Medicaid FFS or CHIP FFS, Medicaid <br/>
managed care plans, and CHIP managed care entities to implement an open API that permits <br/>
third-party applications authorized by the beneficiary or enrollee to retrieve certain standardized <br/>
data. This proposed requirement would provide Medicaid beneficiaries’ and CHIP enrollees <br/>
simple and easy access to their information through common technologies, such as smartphones, <br/>
tablets, or laptop computers, and without special effort on the part of the user. <br/>
For Medicaid, we are proposing these new requirements under the authority in section <br/>
1902(a)(4) of the Act, which requires that a state Medicaid plan for medical assistance provide <br/>
such methods of administration as are found by the Secretary to be necessary for the proper and <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=71></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>71</b>  <br/>
efficient operation of the plan and section 1902(a)(19) of the Act, which requires that care and <br/>
services be provided in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration and the best <br/>
interests of the recipients. For CHIP, we propose these requirements under the authority in <br/>
section 2101(a) of the Act, which sets forth that the purpose of title XXI is to provide funds to <br/>
states to provide child health assistance to uninsured, low-income children in an effective and <br/>
efficient manner that is coordinated with other sources of health benefits coverage. Together <br/>
these provide us with authority (in conjunction with our delegation of authority from the <br/>
Secretary) to adopt requirements for Medicaid and CHIP that are necessary to ensure the <br/>
provision of quality care in an efficient and cost-effective way, consistent with simplicity of <br/>
administration and the best interest of the beneficiary.  <br/>
We believe that requiring state Medicaid and CHIP agencies and managed care <br/>
plans/entities to take steps to make Medicaid beneficiaries’ and CHIP enrollees’ claims, <br/>
encounters, and other health information available through interoperable technology will <br/>
ultimately lead to these enrollees accessing that information in a convenient, timely, and portable <br/>
way, which is essential for these programs to be effectively and efficiently administered in the <br/>
best interests of beneficiaries. Further, as noted in this proposed rule, there are independent <br/>
statutory provisions that require the disclosure and delivery of information to Medicaid <br/>
beneficiaries and CHIP enrollees; this proposal assists in the implementation of those <br/>
requirements in a way that is appropriate and necessary in the 21st century. We believe making <br/>
this information available in this format would result in better health outcomes and patient <br/>
satisfaction and improve the cost effectiveness of the entire health care system, including <br/>
Medicaid and CHIP. Having easy access to their claims, encounter, and other health information <br/>
would also facilitate beneficiaries’ ability to detect and report fraud, waste, and abuse – a critical <br/>
component of an effective program.  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=72></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>72</b>  <br/>
As technology has advanced, we have encouraged states, health plans, and providers to <br/>
adopt various forms of technology to improve the accurate and timely exchange of standardized <br/>
health care information. This proposal would move Medicaid and CHIP programs in the <br/>
direction of enabling better information access by Medicaid beneficiaries and CHIP enrollees, <br/>
which would make them active partners in their health care through the exchange of electronic <br/>
health information by easily monitoring and sharing their data. By requiring that certain <br/>
information be available in and through standardized formats and technologies, our proposal <br/>
moves these programs toward interoperability, which is key for data sharing and access, and <br/>
ultimately, improved health outcomes. As an additional note, states will be expected to <br/>
implement the CHIP provisions using CHIP administrative funding, which is limited under <br/>
section 2105(a)(1)(D)(v) and 2105(c)(2)(A) of the Act to 10 percent of a State’s total annual <br/>
CHIP expenditures. <br/>
(3)  Qualified Health Plan Issuers in Federally-facilitated Exchanges <br/>
We propose a new QHP minimum certification standard at 45 CFR 156.221(a) that would <br/>
require QHP issuers in FFEs, not including SADPs, to implement an open API that permits third-<br/>
party applications, with the approval and at the direction of the individual enrollee, to retrieve <br/>
standardized data concerning adjudicated claims (including cost), encounters with capitated <br/>
providers, and provider remittances, enrollee cost-sharing, and clinical data, including laboratory <br/>
results (where available). We are also proposing to require that the data be made available to <br/>
QHP enrollees through common technologies, such as smartphones or tablets, and without <br/>
special effort from enrollees.   <br/>
We are proposing these new requirements under our authority in section 1311(e)(1)(B) of <br/>
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education <br/>
Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-148, enacted March 23, 2010, and Pub. L. 111-152, <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=73></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>73</b>  <br/>
enacted March 30, 2010, respectively) (collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act), <br/>
which affords the Exchanges the discretion to certify QHPs that are in the best interests of <br/>
qualified individuals and qualified employers. Specifically, section 1311(e) of the Affordable <br/>
Care Act authorizes Exchanges to certify QHPs that meet the QHP certification standards <br/>
established by the Secretary, and if the Exchange determines that making available such health <br/>
plan through such Exchange is in the interests of qualified individuals and qualified employers in <br/>
the state or states in which such Exchange operates.   <br/>
We believe there are numerous benefits associated with individuals having access to their <br/>
health plan data that is built upon widely used standards. The ability to easily obtain, use, and <br/>
share claims, encounter, and other health data enables enrollees to more effectively and easily <br/>
use the health care system. For example, by being able to easily access a comprehensive list of <br/>
their adjudicated claims, the plan enrollee can ensure their providers know what services have <br/>
already been received, avoid receiving duplicate services; and verify when prescriptions were <br/>
filled. We believe these types of activities would result in better health outcomes and enrollee <br/>
satisfaction and improve the cost effectiveness of the entire health care system. Having simple <br/>
and easy access, without special effort, to their health information, including cost and payment <br/>
information, also facilitates enrollees’ ability to detect and report fraud, waste, and abuse – a <br/>
critical component of an effective program. Existing and emerging technologies provide a path to <br/>
make information and resources for health and health care management universal, integrated, <br/>
equitable, accessible to all, and personally relevant. Therefore, we believe generally certifying <br/>
only health plans that make enrollees’ health information available to them in a convenient, <br/>
timely, and portable way is in the interests of qualified individuals and qualified employers in the <br/>
state or states in which an FFE operates. We encourage SBEs to consider whether a similar <br/>
requirement should be applicable to QHP issuers participating in their Exchange.    <br/>

b. API Technical Standard and Content and Vocabulary Standards <br/>
We propose to require at 42 CFR 422.119(a) and (c), 431.60(a) and (c) and 457.730(a) <br/>
and (c), 438.242(b)(6) and 457.1233(d)(2), and 45 CFR 156.221(a) and (c), that MA <br/>
organizations, Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed <br/>
care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs implement open API technology conformant with the API <br/>
technical standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (published <br/>
elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>) (see also section II.A.3. of this proposed rule). We further <br/>
propose to require the use of the following content and vocabulary standards for data available <br/>
through the API, where applicable to the data type or data element, unless an alternate standard is <br/>
required by other applicable law: standards adopted at 45 CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.160; <br/>
and standards proposed by ONC for adoption by HHS at 45 CFR 170.213 (USCDI Version 1). <br/>
See section II.A.3. of this proposed rule for further information about our proposals regarding <br/>
how entities subject to this rule would be required to utilize these standards. We are proposing <br/>
that both the API technical standard and the content and vocabulary standards would be required <br/>
across the MA program, Medicaid program, and CHIP, and by QHP issuers in FFEs (not <br/>
including issuers of SADPs). <br/>
Further, with the new proposed requirements to implement and maintain an API at 42 <br/>
CFR 422.119(a), 431.60(a), and 457.730(a), we are proposing corresponding requirements at <br/>
proposed 42 CFR 422.119(c) for MA plans, 431.60(c) for Medicaid FFS programs, and  <br/>
457.730(c) for CHIP FFS programs implementing the proposed API technology.  In proposed <br/>
paragraphs 42 CFR 422.119(c), 431.60(c), 457.730(c), MA plans and the state Medicaid or CHIP <br/>
(for CHIP agencies that operate FFS systems) agency would be required to implement API <br/>
technology conformant with the standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR <br/>
170.215; for data available through the API, to use content and vocabulary standards adopted at <br/>

45 CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.160, and proposed for adoption at 45 CFR 170.213; and to <br/>
maintain and use the technology in compliance with applicable law, including but not limited to <br/>
45 CFR parts 162, 42 CFR part 2, and the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. <br/>
We similarly propose at 45 CFR 156.221(c) that QHP issuers in FFEs must implement <br/>
API technology conformant with the API technical standards proposed by ONC for HHS <br/>
adoption at 45 CFR 170.215; for data available through the API, use content and vocabulary <br/>
standards adopted at 45 CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.160, and proposed for adoption at 45 <br/>
CFR 170.213; and maintain and use the technology in compliance with applicable law, including <br/>
but not limited to 45 CFR part 162, 42 CFR part 2, and the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.  <br/>
We believe that these proposals would serve to create a health care information <br/>
ecosystem that allows and encourages the health care market to tailor products and services to <br/>
better serve and compete for patients, thereby increasing quality, decreasing costs, and <br/>
empowering patients with information that helps them live better, healthier lives. Additionally, <br/>
under these proposals, clinicians would be able to review information on their patient’s current <br/>
prescriptions and services received by the enrollee on the enrollee’s smartphone.  Also, the <br/>
enrollee could allow clinicians to access such information by sharing data received through the <br/>
API with the clinician’s EHR system—by forwarding the information once the enrollee receives <br/>
it or by authorizing release of the data through the API directly to the clinician’s EHR system.  <br/>
We also encourage payers to consider using the proposed API infrastructure as a means <br/>
to exchange PHI for other health care purposes, such as to health care providers for treatment <br/>
purposes. Sharing interoperable information directly with the enrollee’s health care provider’s <br/>
EHR in advance of a patient visit would save time during appointments and ultimately improve <br/>
the quality of care delivered to patients. Most clinicians and patients have access to the internet, <br/>
providing many access points for viewing health information over secure connections. We <br/>

believe that these proposed requirements would significantly improve patients’ experiences by <br/>
providing a mechanism through which they can access their data in a standardized, computable, <br/>
and digital format in alignment with other public and private health care entities. We also believe <br/>
that these proposals are designed to empower patients to have simple and easy access to their <br/>
data in a usable digital format, and therefore, can empower them to decide how their health <br/>
information is going to be used. However, we remind payers that this proposed regulation <br/>
regarding the API would not lower or change their obligations as HIPAA covered entities to <br/>
comply with regulations regarding standard transactions in 45 CFR part 162.  <br/>
As discussed in section II.A.3. of this proposed rule, we recognize that while we must <br/>
codify in regulation a specific version of each standard, the need for continually evolving <br/>
standards development has historically outpaced our ability to amend regulations. To address <br/>
how standards development can outpace our rulemaking schedule, we offer several proposals. <br/>
We propose that regulated entities may use an updated version of a standard where required by <br/>
other applicable law. We also propose that regulated entities may use an updated version of the <br/>
standard where not prohibited by other applicable law, under certain circumstances. First, we <br/>
propose to allow the use of an updated version of content or vocabulary standards adopted at 45 <br/>
CFR part 162 or 42 CFR 423.160, unless the use of the updated version of the standard is prohibited <br/>
for entities regulated by that part or the program under that section, is prohibited by the Secretary <br/>
for purposes of these policies, is prohibited for use in ONC’s Health IT Certification Program, or <br/>
is prohibited by other applicable law.  <br/>
Second, for the content and vocabulary standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at <br/>
45 CFR 170.213 (USCDI Version 1), as well as for API interoperability standards proposed by <br/>
ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (including HL7 FHIR and other standards discussed <br/>
above), we propose to allow the use of an updated version, provided such updated version has <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=77></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>77</b>  <br/>
been approved by the National Coordinator through the Standards Version Advancement Process <br/>
described in ONC’s 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal </b><br/>
<b>Register</b>)).  <br/>
Finally, we propose that use of an updated standard by a payer that is subject to these <br/>
proposed regulations must not disrupt an end user’s ability to access the data available through <br/>
the API proposed in section III. of this proposed rule using an application that was designed to <br/>
work with an API that conforms to the API standard proposed under this rule.  Entities that <br/>
would be required to implement an open API under this rulemaking would be free to upgrade to <br/>
newer versions of the required standards, subject only to those limiting conditions noted here, <br/>
and at any pace they wish. However, they must continue to support connectivity and make the <br/>
same data available to applications that have been built to support only the adopted version(s) of <br/>
the API standards. For further discussion of these proposals, see section II.A.3.D. of this <br/>
proposed rule. <br/>
c.  Data Required to be Available Through the Open API &amp; Timeframes for Data Availability <br/>
We propose the content that must be accessible for each enrollee of an entity subject to <br/>
our open API proposal as set out at paragraph (b) of 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, and 457.730 and <br/>
45 CFR 156.221; as noted previously, the regulations for Medicaid managed care plans and <br/>
CHIP managed care entities cross-reference and incorporate the regulations we propose for <br/>
Medicaid and CHIP programs. We note that the types of content proposed here would represent <br/>
the minimum threshold for compliance; at their discretion, MA organizations, state Medicaid and <br/>
CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP <br/>
issuers in FFEs would have the option to use the API required by this proposed rule to make <br/>
additional types of health information or plan information available, exceeding these minimum <br/>
requirements. <br/>

We request comment on the data proposed to be made available as detailed in the <br/>
subsections below, the appropriateness of the proposed timeframes, and suggestions for <br/>
alternative timeframes that consider the utility to the beneficiary, as well as challenges that the <br/>
proposed timeframe may create for the entities that would have to comply. <br/>
(1)  Patient Claims and Encounter Data <br/>
We propose that MA organizations, Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid <br/>
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs, permit third-party <br/>
applications to retrieve, with the approval of an enrollee, certain specific data: adjudicated claims <br/>
data, including provider remittances and beneficiary or enrollee cost-sharing data; encounters <br/>
from capitated providers; and clinical data, including laboratory results (but only if managed by <br/>
the payer). Adjudicated claims data would include on approved and denied claims; under this <br/>
proposal, adjudicated claims data includes that for which the plan has made an initial payment <br/>
decision even when the period during which an enrollee can file an appeal is still in effect, or <br/>
when the enrollee has filed an appeal and is awaiting a reconsideration decision. We specifically <br/>
request comments from plans regarding the feasibility of including such claims data, including <br/>
any possible timing issues. In addition, the open APIs required for these entities must make <br/>
available formulary information (for MA-PD plans) or information about covered outpatient <br/>
drugs and preferred drug lists (for state Medicaid and CHIP agencies, Medicaid managed care <br/>
plans and CHIP managed care entities).  <br/>
Our proposal includes timeframe requirements for making these various categories of <br/>
data available through the open API.  For MA organizations, proposed 42 CFR 422.119(b)(1)(i), <br/>
(1)(ii), and (2)(i) would require open API access to all claims activity pertaining to adjudicated <br/>
claims (including cost) and encounter data for benefits covered by the plan (that is, Medicare <br/>
Part A and Part B items and services, Part D prescription drugs if covered by the MA plan, and <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=79></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>79</b>  <br/>
any supplemental benefits) no later than one (1) business day after a claim is adjudicated or the <br/>
encounter data is received by the MA organization. For clinical data, including laboratory results, <br/>
MA organizations that manage such data would be required under 42 CFR 422.119(b)(1)(iv) to <br/>
provide access through the open API to that data no later than one business day after it is <br/>
received by the MA plan. For Medicaid state agencies and managed care plans, claims data, <br/>
encounter data, and clinical data, including laboratory results (if available) would be required <br/>
(specifically at 42 CFR 431.60(b)(1),(2), and (4)) through the API no later than one business day <br/>
after the claim is processed or the data is received. For State Medicaid agencies in connection <br/>
with the FFS program, the API would have to include all claims data concerning adjudicated <br/>
claims and standardized encounter data from providers (other than MCOs, PIHPs or PAHPs) that <br/>
are paid using capitated payments. The requirement for Medicaid managed care plans to provide <br/>
encounter data is specified at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6)(i); encounter data would include any data <br/>
from subcontractors and providers compensated by the managed care plan on the basis of <br/>
capitation payments, such as behavioral health organizations, dental management organizations, <br/>
and pharmacy benefit managers.  The API of Medicaid managed care plans would have to <br/>
include all claims and encounter data would be included regardless if it is adjudicated or <br/>
generated by the managed care plan itself, subcontractor, or provider compensated on the basis <br/>
of capitation payments.  All data would need to be obtained in a timely manner to comply with <br/>
these proposed requirements. <br/>
For CHIP agencies and managed care entities, claims data, encounter data, and reports of <br/>
lab test results (if available) would be required (specifically at 42 CFR 457.730(b)(1),(2), and <br/>
(4)) through the API as soon as possible but no later than one business day.  The proposal for <br/>
CHIP state agencies (regarding FFS programs) and CHIP managed care entities is identical to the <br/>
proposal for Medicaid State agencies (regarding FFS programs) and Medicaid managed care <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=80></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>80</b>  <br/>
plans.  For QHP issuers in FFEs, our proposed regulation at 45 CFR 156.221(b) would require <br/>
claims, encounter, and lab data to be available within one business day of adjudication and <br/>
receipt, respectively. <br/>
These proposed timeframes would ensure that data provided through the API would be <br/>
the most current data available, which may be critical if the data is provided by an enrollee to his <br/>
or her health care provider to use in making clinical decisions. Under our proposal, the claims <br/>
and encounter data to be disclosed should include information such as enrollee identifiers, dates <br/>
of service, payment information (provider remittance if applicable and available), and enrollee <br/>
cost-sharing. The ability for enrollees – created and facilitated by the API required under our <br/>
proposal -– to access this information electronically would make it easier for them to take it with <br/>
them as they move from payer to payer or among providers across the care continuum. <br/>
Regarding the provision of standardized encounter data through the API within one (1) <br/>
business day of the receiving the data, we note that this proposal would mean that a payer must <br/>
rely on capitated providers submitting their encounter data in a timely manner to ensure that <br/>
patients receive a timely and complete set of data. To the extent providers do not submit in a <br/>
timely manner, there would be a delay in patients having access to their data. We recommend <br/>
that MA organizations, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP <br/>
issuers in FFEs that would need this information in order to meet the proposed API requirements <br/>
should consider whether their contracts with network providers should include timing <br/>
requirements for the submission of encounter data and claims so that the payer can comply with <br/>
the API requirements.  For Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, we encourage states to consider <br/>
other means to ensure that necessary encounter data from providers is also provided on a timely <br/>
basis. <br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>81</b>  <br/>
We note that the data for claims and remittances that would be available through the API <br/>
is much of the same data that is required for the ASC X12 837, ASC X12 835, and ASC X12 863 <br/>
standards which are required for certain transactions between certain entities under 45 CFR <br/>
162.1102, 162.1602 and 162.1603, as well as the Part D eRx transaction standards that use for <br/>
conveying prescription and prescription-related information between Part D plans, providers, and <br/>
pharmacies as specified in 42 CFR 423.160. As most claims are submitted to payers <br/>
electronically utilizing these industry standard transaction types, we believe this maximizes <br/>
efficiency and reduces programming burden. As noted previously, our proposed regulation for <br/>
Medicaid managed care plans at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) and for CHIP managed care entities at 42 <br/>
CFR 457.1233(d)(2) would require MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs to comply with the same standard <br/>
transaction types. <br/>
Specifically regarding QHP issuers in FFEs, in 45 CFR 156.221(b)(1)(i) and (ii), we <br/>
propose to require that QHP issuers participating in an FFE make available through the API <br/>
standardized data concerning adjudicated claims (including cost) and encounters with capitated <br/>
providers. Under proposed paragraph (b)(1)(i), QHP issuers in FFEs would be required to make <br/>
available standardized adjudicated claim, provider remittance, and enrollee cost-sharing data <br/>
through the API within one (1) business day after the claim is processed. Under proposed <br/>
paragraph (b)(1)(ii), QHP issuers in FFEs would be required to provide standardized encounter <br/>
data through the API within one (1) business day of the issuer receiving the data.  <br/>
We are also considering requiring the encounter data to be available through the API <br/>
within a certain period after the encounter, within one (1) business day after the encounter data is <br/>
received.  We seek comment on what a reasonable period from the encounter date would be for <br/>
us to consider as part of future rulemaking.  In addition, we solicit comment on our authority to <br/>
require MA organizations, States (for FFS Medicaid programs and CHIP), Medicaid and CHIP <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=82></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>82</b>  <br/>
managed care plans, and QHPs in the FFEs to require submission of such data on a particular <br/>
timeframe. <br/>
(2)  Provider Directory Data  <br/>
We are also proposing at 42 CFR 422.119(b)(1)(iii), 431.60(b)(3), 438.242(b)(6)(ii), <br/>
457.730(b)(3), and 457.1233(d)(2)(ii) that the required API make available  provider directory <br/>
data, including updates to such data. Our proposal at 45 CFR 156.221 would not require QHP <br/>
issuers to permit third-party retrieval of provider directory and preferred drug list information <br/>
because such information is already required to be provided by QHPs in FFEs.   <br/>
For MA organizations, at proposed 42 CFR 422.119(b)(1)(iii), we propose to specify that <br/>
MA organizations make specific provider directory information for their network of contracted <br/>
providers accessible through their APIs:  the names of providers; addresses; phone numbers; and <br/>
specialty.  This information is the same information MA organizations are already required to <br/>
disclose to their enrollees under 42 CFR 422.111(b)(3) and make available online under 42 CFR <br/>
422.111(h)(2)(ii). MA organizations would be required to ensure the availability of this <br/>
information through their APIs for all MA plans. Including this information in an open API <br/>
allows non- MA third-party applications to consume, aggregate, and display plan data in <br/>
different contexts, allowing patients to understand and compare plan information in a way that <br/>
can best serve their individual needs. MA plans would be required to update provider directory <br/>
information available through the API no later than 30 calendar days after changes to the <br/>
provider directory are made. In addition, we are adding a new MA contract requirement at 42 <br/>
CFR 422.504(a)(18) specifying that MA organizations must comply with the requirement for <br/>
access to health data and plan information under 42 CFR 422.119.  <br/>
Under proposed 42 CFR 431.60(b)(3) and 457.730(b)(3), state Medicaid and CHIP <br/>
agencies respectively would be required to make provider directory information available <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=83></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>83</b>  <br/>
through the API, including updated provider information no later than 30 calendar days after the <br/>
state receives updated provider information. As noted previously, our proposed regulation for <br/>
Medicaid managed care plans at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) and for CHIP managed care entities at 42 <br/>
CFR 457.1233(d)(2) would require MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs to comply with the same <br/>
standard, with the addition of specific provider directory information as noted in 42 CFR <br/>
438.242(b)(6)(ii) and 457.1233(d)(2)(ii). For Medicaid managed care plans and CHIP managed <br/>
care entities, the provider directory information available through the API must include all <br/>
information that is specified in 42 CFR 438.10(h)(1) for disclosure to managed care enrollees. <br/>
We note that we have proposed that the API be updated with new provider directory information <br/>
within 30 calendar days from when the updated information is received by the State (or the <br/>
managed care plan under 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) and 457.1233(d)(2)) to be consistent with <br/>
existing Medicaid managed care rules at 42 CFR 438.10(h)(3). We propose that the API <br/>
implemented by the State Medicaid agency would include the data elements specified for <br/>
disclosure by Medicaid state agencies in section 1902(a)(83) of the Act; we propose in 42 CFR <br/>
438.242(b)(6)(ii) that the API implemented by Medicaid managed care plans would have the <br/>
data elements specified for disclosure at 42 CFR 438.10(h)(1). For CHIP agencies that operate <br/>
FFS systems and CHIP managed care entities at 42 CFR 457.730(b)(3) and 457.1233(d)(2)(ii), <br/>
respectively, we have also proposed 30 calendar days.   <br/>
We are not proposing a similar requirement for QHP issuers in FFEs. These issuers are <br/>
already required, under 45 CFR 156.230(c) and implementing guidance, to make provider <br/>
directory information accessible in a machine-readable format. Because this information is <br/>
already highly accessible in this format, we do not believe the benefits of making it also <br/>
available through an open API outweigh the burden for QHP issuers in FFEs. However, we seek <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=84></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>84</b>  <br/>
comment as to whether this same requirement should apply to QHP issuers, or if such a <br/>
requirement would be overly burdensome for them. <br/>
We request comment on these proposals. <br/>
(3)  Clinical Data including Laboratory Results <br/>
Regarding the provision of clinical data, including laboratory results, we propose at 42 <br/>
CFR 422.119(b)(1)(iv) that MA organizations make clinical data, such as laboratory test results <br/>
available through the API if the MA organization manages such data. Because we propose in <br/>
paragraph (c) that the USCDI standard, proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.213, <br/>
be used as the content and vocabulary standard for this clinical data as provided in the API, we <br/>
intend our proposal to mean that the data required under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) be the same as the <br/>
data that is specified in that content and vocabulary standard. In effect, we are proposing any <br/>
clinical data included in the USCDI standard, proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR <br/>
170.213, be available through the API if such data is managed by the MA organization. We <br/>
recognize that some MA organizations receive this information regularly or as a part of their <br/>
contracted arrangements for health services, but that not all MA organizations do. Therefore, this <br/>
proposed requirement applies to MA organizations, regardless of the type of MA plan offered by <br/>
the MA organization, but only under circumstances when the MA organization receives and <br/>
maintains this data as a part of its normal operations. This proposed requirement aligns with <br/>
existing regulations at 42 CFR 422.118, which require MA organizations to disclose to <br/>
individual enrollees any medical records or other health or enrollment information the MA <br/>
organizations maintain with respect to their enrollees.  We propose that this data be available in <br/>
the API no later than 1 business day from its receipt by the MA organization. <br/>
Similarly, the proposed regulations for Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs and managed <br/>
care plans (proposed 42 CFR 431.60(b)(4) and 457.730(b)(4)), require provision of standardized <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=85></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>85</b>  <br/>
data for clinical data, including laboratory results, through the API, if available, no later than one <br/>
(1) business day after a claim is adjudicated or the data is received (by the state or the managed <br/>
care plan/entity). This would ensure that data provided through the API would be the most <br/>
current data available, which may be critical if the data is being shared by an enrollee with a <br/>
health care provider who is basing clinical decisions on the data. Like proposed 42 CFR <br/>
422.119(c), these Medicaid and CHIP regulations propose use of the that the USCDI standard, <br/>
proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.213, as the content and vocabulary standard <br/>
for the clinical data available through the API; therefore, we are, in effect, proposing any clinical <br/>
data included in the USCDI standard, proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.213, <br/>
be available through the API.  For state agencies managing Medicaid or CHIP FFS programs, <br/>
such data must be included through the API under our proposal only if the state manages clinical <br/>
data.  Our proposed regulation for Medicaid managed care plans at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) and <br/>
CHIP managed care entities at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) would require MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs <br/>
to comply with the same standard in terms of the scope of information and the timing of its <br/>
availability through the API; the limitation about the availability of clinical data through the API <br/>
would carry through to managed care plans and entities under our proposal.    <br/>
Proposed 45 CFR 156.221(b)(3) requires QHP issuers in FFEs to also make available, <br/>
with the approval of the enrollee, clinical data, including laboratory results, if the QHP maintains <br/>
such data.   <br/>
We recognize not all of the entities subject to this requirement have uniform access to <br/>
this type of data and seek comment on what barriers exist that would discourage them from <br/>
obtaining, maintaining, and sharing this data. We request comment on these proposals.  <br/>
(4)  Drug Benefit Data, including Pharmacy Directory, and Formulary Data <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=86></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>86</b>  <br/>
We are also proposing that drug benefit data, including pharmacy directory information <br/>
and formulary or preferred drug list data, also be available through the API at proposed 42 CFR <br/>
422.119(b)(2)(ii) and (iii), 431.60(b)(5), and 457.730(b)(5). As previously discussed, Medicaid <br/>
managed care plans would be required by 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) to comply with the requirement <br/>
at 42 CFR 431.60(b)(5), and CHIP managed care entities would be required by 42 CFR <br/>
457.1233(d)(2) to comply with the requirement at 42 CFR 457.730(b)(5). <br/>
We propose at 42 CFR 422.119(b)(2)(ii) and (iii) that MA organizations offering MA-PD <br/>
plans make available pharmacy directory data, including the number, mix, and addresses of <br/>
pharmacies in the plan network, as well as formulary data including covered Part D drugs and <br/>
any tiered formulary structure or utilization management procedure which pertains to those <br/>
drugs.  The pharmacy directory information is the same information that MA-PD plans – like all <br/>
Part D plans – must provide on their websites under 42 CFR 423.128(b)(5) and (d)(2).  While <br/>
prescription drug claims would have to be made available through the API no later than 1 <br/>
business day of the MA-PD plan’s receipt of that information, we are not proposing a specific <br/>
timeframe for pharmacy directory or formulary information to be available (or updated) through <br/>
the API.  We intend that the requirements in 42 CFR part 423 requiring when and how <br/>
information related to pharmacy directories be updated will apply to the provision of this <br/>
information through the API; we solicit comment specifically whether we should address this in <br/>
the regulation text or otherwise impose a time-frame for this information to be made available <br/>
through the API.  <br/>
At proposed 42 CFR 431.60(b)(5), for Medicaid FFS programs, and at 42 CFR <br/>
457.730(b)(5) for CHIP FFS programs, states would be required to include and update covered <br/>
outpatient drug lists (including, where applicable, preferred drug lists) through the API no later <br/>
than one (1) business day after the effective date of the information or any changes. We are <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=87></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>87</b>  <br/>
proposing to set this timeframe at one (1) business day because we believe that it is critical for <br/>
beneficiaries and prescribers to have this information as soon as the information is applicable to <br/>
coverage or in near real time since this information could improve care and health outcomes. <br/>
Having timely data is particularly important during urgent or emergency situations. Medicaid <br/>
managed care plans and CHIP managed care entities would be required to comply with these <br/>
requirements as well under proposed 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) and 457.1233(d)(2). We also note <br/>
that adjudicated claims and encounter data referenced in 42 CFR 431.60(b)(1) and (2),  <br/>
438.242(b)(6), and 457.730(b)(1) and (2) include claims and encounter data for covered <br/>
outpatient drugs. To the extent that a state or managed care plan utilizes a pharmacy benefit <br/>
manager (PBM), we anticipate that, as a practical matter, the state or managed care plan would <br/>
need to obtain the data from the PBM in a timely manner to comply with these proposed <br/>
requirements.    <br/>
We request comment on these proposals.  <br/>
d. Documentation Requirements for APIs<b> </b><br/>
We are proposing that the specific business and technical documentation necessary to <br/>
interact with the proposed APIs be made freely and publicly accessible. As discussed in section <br/>
II.A.1 of this proposed rule, we believe transparency about API technology is needed to ensure <br/>
that any interested third-party application developer can easily obtain the information needed to <br/>
develop applications technically compatible with the organization’s API. Transparency is also <br/>
needed so that third-parties can understand how to successfully interact with an organization’s <br/>
API, including by satisfying any requirements the organization may establish for verification of <br/>
developers’ identity and their applications’ authenticity, consistent with its security risk analysis <br/>
and related organizational policies and procedures to ensure it maintains an appropriate level of <br/>
privacy and security protection for data on its systems. <br/>

Specifically, at 42 CFR 422.119(d), 431.60(d), 457.730(d), and 45 CFR 156.221(d), we <br/>
propose virtually identical text to require publication of complete accompanying documentation <br/>
regarding the API by posting this documentation directly on the applicable entity’s website or via <br/>
a publicly accessible hyperlink. As previously discussed, Medicaid managed care plans would be <br/>
required by 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) to comply with the requirement at 42 CFR 431.60(d), and <br/>
CHIP managed care entities would be required by 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) to comply with the <br/>
requirement at 42 CFR 457.730(d). In requiring that this documentation is “publicly accessible,” <br/>
we expect that any person using commonly available technology to browse the Internet could <br/>
access the information without any preconditions or additional steps beyond downloading and <br/>
using a third-party application to access data through the API. This is not intended to preclude <br/>
use of links the user would click to review the full text of lengthy documents or access sources of <br/>
additional information, such as if the technology’s supplier prefers to host technical <br/>
documentation at a centralized location. Rather, we mean “additional steps” to include actions <br/>
such as: collecting a fee for access to the documentation; requiring the reader to receive a copy <br/>
of the material via email; or requiring the user to read promotional material or agree to receive <br/>
future communications from the organization making the documentation available. We <br/>
specifically solicit comments on these points. <br/>
We propose that the publicly accessible documentation would be required to include, at a <br/>
minimum, the following information:  <br/>
●  API syntax, function names, required and optional parameters supported and their data <br/>
types, return variables and their types/structures, exceptions and exception handling methods and <br/>
their returns. <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=89></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>89</b>  <br/>
●  The software components and configurations an application must use in order to <br/>
successfully interact with the API (for example, to connect and receive data through the API) and <br/>
process its response(s). <br/>
●  All applicable technical requirements and attributes necessary for an application to be <br/>
registered with any authorization server(s) deployed in conjunction with the API.  <br/>
We note that these information requirements are similar to those ONC has proposed for <br/>
adoption by HHS for developers and users of health IT certified to the API criteria proposed at <br/>
45 CFR 170.315 (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>), but are proposed here to apply <br/>
specifically to the API technology deployed by organizations subject to the API requirements <br/>
proposed in section III. of this proposed rule. We request comments on this proposal. <br/>
e.  Routine Testing and Monitoring of Open APIs <br/>
At 42 CFR 422.119(c)(2), 431.60(c)(2), 457.730(c)(2), and 45 CFR 156.221(c)(2) for <br/>
MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, and QHP issuers in FFEs, <br/>
respectively, we are proposing that the API be routinely tested and monitored to ensure it is <br/>
functioning properly, including assessments to verify that the API is fully and successfully <br/>
implementing  privacy and security features such as but not limited to those minimally required <br/>
to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security requirements in 45 CFR part 164, 42 CFR parts <br/>
2 and 3, and other applicable law protecting privacy and security of individually identifiable <br/>
health information. Medicaid managed care plans would be required by 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) to <br/>
comply with the requirement at 42 CFR 431.60(c), and CHIP managed care entities would be <br/>
required by 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) to comply with the requirement at 42 CFR 457.730(c).  <br/>
Additionally, we note that while federal laws that regulate MA organizations and MA <br/>
plans supersede any state law except where noted under section 1856(b)(3) of the Act, some <br/>
state, local, or tribal laws that pertain to privacy and security of individually identifiable <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=90></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>90</b>  <br/>
information generally and are not specific to health insurance may also apply to MA <br/>
organizations and MA plans in the context of our proposal.  For the other entities regulated under <br/>
our proposals in these various programs, we also intend the phrase “other applicable law” to <br/>
include federal, state, tribal or local laws that apply to the entity. <br/>
We propose this requirement to establish and maintain processes to routinely test and <br/>
monitor the open APIs to ensure they are functioning properly, especially with respect to their <br/>
privacy and security features. Under our proposal, MA organizations, Medicaid and CHIP FFS <br/>
programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs <br/>
would have to implement, properly maintain, update (as appropriate), and routinely test <br/>
authentication features that will be used to verify the identity of individual enrollees who seek to <br/>
access their claims and encounter data and other PHI through the API. Similarly, compliance <br/>
with our proposed requirements would mean that these entities must implement, maintain, update <br/>
(as appropriate), and routinely test authorization features to ensure an individual enrollee or their <br/>
personal representative can only access claims and encounter data or other PHI that belongs to <br/>
that enrollee. As is the case under existing HIPAA requirements, where an enrollee is also a <br/>
properly designated personal representative of another enrollee, the HIPAA covered entity must <br/>
provide for appropriate access to the information of the enrollee that has designated the personal <br/>
representative, just as they would if the personal representative were an enrollee of the same <br/>
plan.   <br/>
Similarly, at proposed 45 CFR 156.221(c)(2), QHP issuers in FFEs would be required to <br/>
routinely test and monitor their API to confirm that it is functioning properly.  <br/>
 <br/>
We request comment on these proposals.  <br/>

f.  Compliance with Existing Privacy and Security Requirements <br/>
In the hands of a HIPAA covered entity or its business associate, individually identifiable <br/>
patient claims, encounter data, and other health information are PHI as defined at 45 CFR <br/>
160.103. Ensuring the privacy and security of the claims, encounter, and other health information <br/>
when it is transmitted through the API is of critical importance. Therefore, we remind MA <br/>
organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP <br/>
managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs that mechanisms and practices to release PHI, <br/>
including but not limited to authorization and authentication protocols and practices must <br/>
provide protection sufficient to comply with HIPAA privacy and security regulations at 45 CFR <br/>
part 164 and other law (whether federal, state, tribal or local) that may apply based on the <br/>
specific circumstances. Under this proposal, the entities subject to these requirements would <br/>
need to continuously ensure that all authorization and authentication mechanisms provide <br/>
sufficient protections to enrollee PHI and that they function as intended. We specifically request <br/>
public comment on whether existing privacy and security standards, including but not limited to <br/>
those in 45 CFR part 164, are sufficient with respect to these proposals, or whether additional <br/>
privacy and security standards should be required by CMS as part of this proposal.  <br/>
g. Issues Related to Denial or Discontinuation of Access to the API <br/>
As discussed in section II.A of this proposed rule, HIPAA covered entities must comply <br/>
with patients’ requests to receive their data under the HIPAA Right of Access, including having <br/>
to transmit patient data to a third party. As noted in guidance from OCR, disagreement with the <br/>
individual about the worthiness of the third party as a recipient of PHI, or even concerns about <br/>
what the third party might do with the PHI, are not grounds for denying a request.<a href="CMSs.html#91">27 </a>However, a <br/>

covered entity is not expected to tolerate unacceptable levels of risk to the PHI held by the <br/>
covered entity in its systems, as determined by its own risk analysis.<a href="CMSs.html#92">28 </a>Accordingly, it may be <br/>
appropriate for an organization to deny or terminate specific applications’ connection to its API <br/>
under certain circumstances in which the application poses an unacceptable risk to the PHI on its <br/>
systems or otherwise violates the terms of use of the API technology.  <br/>
At 42 CFR 422.119(e), 431.60(e), 438.242(b)(6), 457.730(e), 457.1233(d)(2) and 45 CFR <br/>
156.221(e) for MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed <br/>
care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs, we are proposing to specify <br/>
the circumstances under which these regulated entities, which are all HIPAA-covered entities <br/>
subject to HIPAA privacy and security requirements, may decline to establish or may terminate a <br/>
third-party application’s connection to the covered entity’s API while remaining in compliance <br/>
with our proposed requirement to offer patients access through open APIs. We intend for this <br/>
proposal to be consistent with the HIPAA rules, and we note that these circumstances apply to <br/>
specific applications, rather than the third party itself. For instance, were the individual to request <br/>
that the HIPAA covered entity provide the individual’s information through other means than <br/>
through an API to the same third party that would have received it on the individual’s behalf <br/>
through an application which has been denied access, the covered entity would be required to <br/>
approach that request as if the application’s API request or connection had not occurred. <br/>
Specifically, we propose that an MA organization, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS <br/>
program, Medicaid managed care plan, CHIP managed care entity, or QHP issuer in an FFE, <br/>
may, in accordance with HIPAA, deny access to the API if the entity reasonably determines that <br/>
allowing that application to connect or remain connected to the API would present an <br/>
                                                           <br/>

unacceptable level of risk to the security of PHI on the organization’s systems. We further <br/>
propose that this determination must be based on objective, verifiable criteria that are applied <br/>
fairly and consistently across all applications through which enrollees seek to access their <br/>
electronic health information as defined at 45 CFR 171.102, including but not limited to criteria <br/>
that may rely on automated monitoring and risk mitigation tools.  <br/>
Where we propose to require access through open APIs to otherwise publicly available <br/>
information, such as provider directories, the entities subject to our proposal may also deny or <br/>
terminate an application’s connection to the API when it makes a similar determination about <br/>
risk to its systems. However, depending on how the organization’s systems are designed and <br/>
configured, we recognize that the criteria and tolerable risk levels appropriate to assessing an <br/>
application for connection to an API for access to publicly available information may differ from <br/>
those required for API access to non-published PII. <br/>
We also anticipate that, where an application’s connection has been terminated under <br/>
these circumstances, it might be feasible in some instances for the organization to allow the <br/>
application to re-connect to the API if and when the flaw or compromise of the application has <br/>
been addressed sufficiently that the organization can no longer fairly say the application’s API <br/>
connection continues to pose an unacceptable risk. <br/>
We request comment on these proposals. <br/>
h. Enrollee and Beneficiary Resources Regarding Privacy and Security <br/>
As discussed in section II.A. of this proposed rule, we are committed to maximizing <br/>
enrollees’ access to and control over their health information. We believe this calls for providing <br/>
enrollees that would access data under our proposal with essential information about the privacy <br/>
and security of their information, and what to do if they believe they have been misled or <br/>
deceived about an application’s terms of use or privacy policy. <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=94></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>94</b>  <br/>
At 42 CFR 422.119(g), 431.60(f), and 457.730(f),  and 45 CFR 156.221(g), we propose <br/>
to require MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care <br/>
plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs, to make available to their current <br/>
and former enrollees certain information about: factors to consider in selecting a health <br/>
information management application, practical strategies to help them safeguard the privacy and <br/>
security of their data, and how to submit complaints to OCR or FTC. These proposed obligations <br/>
are proposed to apply to Medicaid managed care plans and CHIP managed care entities through <br/>
cross-references proposed in 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) and 457.1233(d)(2). <br/>
The general information about the steps individuals can take to help protect the privacy <br/>
and security of their health information should not be limited to, but should specifically include <br/>
and emphasize the importance of understanding the privacy and security practices of any <br/>
application to which they entrust their data.  Information about submitting complaints should <br/>
include both specific contact information for the OCR and FTC complaints processes and a brief <br/>
overview, in simple and easy-to-understand language, of: what organizations are HIPAA covered <br/>
entities, OCR’s responsibility to oversee compliance with HIPAA, and FTC’s complementary <br/>
responsibility to oversee unfair and deceptive practices, including by non-covered entities that <br/>
may offer direct-to-consumer health information management applications. <br/>
We propose that this information must be made available on the website of the <br/>
organization subject to this proposed requirement, and through other appropriate mechanisms <br/>
through which the organization ordinarily communicates with enrollees. This could include <br/>
customer portals, online customer service help desks, and other locations, such as any portals <br/>
through which enrollees and former enrollees might request disclosure of their data to a third-<br/>
party application through the organization’s API. We are also proposing that the entity must <br/>
make this information available in non-technical, consumer-friendly language. <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=95></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>95</b>  <br/>
We anticipate that organizations could meet the requirement to provide information to <br/>
current and former enrollees in whole or in part using materials designed for consumer audiences <br/>
that are available on the HHS website (for example, content and materials such as those available <br/>
at<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/right-to-access/index.html"> https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/right-to-access/index.html)</a> and FTC website (for <br/>
example, content and materials such as those available at <br/>
<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/online-security">https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/online-security) </a> However, we note that whether the <br/>
organization chooses to draft its own resource materials to provide the required information or to <br/>
rely on governmental or other sources for such materials, the organization will be responsible for <br/>
ensuring that the content of the materials remains current as relevant law and policy may evolve <br/>
over time. We seek comment on this proposal, and we invite additional comments on what <br/>
specific information resources in addition to those already available on the websites noted above <br/>
would be most useful to entities in meeting this requirement. We anticipate using this feedback <br/>
to help inform HHS planning and prioritization of informational resource development work in <br/>
addition to making a decision on the final rule regarding this proposal. <br/>
i. Exceptions or Provisions Specific to Certain Programs or Sub-Programs <br/>
We are proposing certain exceptions or specific additional provisions as part of this <br/>
proposed rule for certain QHPs in FFEs and certain types of MA plans, respectively. Under <br/>
sections 1856, 1857, and 1860D-12(b)(3) of the Act, we proposed at 42 CFR 422.119(b)(2) to <br/>
include additional requirements that would apply specifically to MA organizations that offer <br/>
Medicare Advantage-Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plans. The organizations offering these MA-<br/>
PD plans must comply with MA requirements in 42 CFR part 422 for Part A, Part B and non-<br/>
drug supplemental benefits; they must comply with Part D requirements in 42 CFR part 423 for <br/>
the Part D prescription drug benefit. These additional requirements would ensure that enrollees <br/>
of MA-PD plans can easily access the information they need in order to adhere to their care <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=96></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>96</b>  <br/>
plans. Including this information in an open API allows non- MA third-party applications to <br/>
properly use, aggregate, and display plan data in different contexts, enabling another means of <br/>
accessing information for patients and more options for comparing and understanding plan <br/>
information in a way that can best serve their individual needs.  <br/>
Specifically, at 42 CFR 422.119 (b)(2)(i), we propose to require MA organizations make <br/>
standardized data concerning adjudicated Part D claims, including remittances and enrollee cost-<br/>
sharing, available through the API to enrollees covered under a MA-PD plan. We propose to <br/>
require that this information be made available no later than one (1) business day after a claim is <br/>
adjudicated. This would ensure that data provided through the API would be the most current <br/>
data available, which may be critical if the data is being used by a provider who is basing clinical <br/>
decisions on the data. To the extent that an MA organization offering MA-PD plans utilizes a <br/>
PBM, the MA organization would be required to obtain the data from the PBM in order to <br/>
comply with these requirements.  <br/>
Related to QHP issuers, we propose two exceptions to this proposed rule. First, we <br/>
propose that the requirements proposed in 45 CFR 156.221(a) not apply to issuers of SADPs in <br/>
the FFEs. In contrast to QHP issuers of medical plans, issuers of SADPs offer enrollees access to <br/>
a unique and specialized form of medical care. We believe the proposed standards and health IT <br/>
investment would be overly burdensome for SADP issuers as related to their current enrollment <br/>
and premium intake and could result in SADP issuers no longer participating in FFEs, which <br/>
would not be in the best interest of enrollees. Additionally, we believe much of the benefit to <br/>
enrollees from requiring issuers of QHPs to make patient data more easily available through a <br/>
standard format depends upon deployment of open API technology that conforms to standards <br/>
proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal </b><br/>
<b>Register</b>) and a corresponding energetic response by the developer community in developing <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=97></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>97</b>  <br/>
innovative, useful, usable, and affordable consumer-facing applications through which plan <br/>
enrollees can conveniently access, use, and share their information as they choose. Through our <br/>
proposals in this section to require implementation of open API technology in the Medicare, <br/>
Medicaid and CHIP programs, as well as by QHP issuers in FFEs, we would anticipate <br/>
significantly expanding the implementation of open APIs by medical plans. However, we do not <br/>
anticipate similar widespread usage with respect to SADPs. Therefore, we believe that the utility <br/>
of access to issuers’ data is less applicable to dental coverage, and do not believe it would be in <br/>
the interest of qualified individuals and qualified employers in the state in which an FFE operates <br/>
to not certify SADPs because they do not provide patient access to their data through an openly-<br/>
published API. We seek comment on whether we should apply this policy to SADP issuers in the <br/>
future.  <br/>
We also propose to provide an exceptions process through which an FFE may certify <br/>
health plans that do not provide patient access through an openly-published API, but otherwise <br/>
meet the requirements for QHP certification. We propose in 45 CFR 156.221(h)(1) that if a plan <br/>
applying for QHP certification to be offered through an FFE does not provide patient access to <br/>
their data through an open API, the issuer must include as part of its QHP application a narrative <br/>
justification outlining the reasons why the plan cannot reasonably satisfy the requirements in <br/>
proposed 45 CFR 156.221(a),(b), or (c), the impact of non-compliance upon enrollees, the <br/>
current or proposed means of providing health information to enrollees, and proposed solutions <br/>
and timeline to achieve API compliance. In 45 CFR 156.221(h)(2), we propose that an FFE may <br/>
grant an exception to the requirement to provide enrollees access to data through open API <br/>
technology if the FFE determines that making available such health plan is in the interest of <br/>
qualified individuals and qualified employers in the state in which the FFE operates. We <br/>
anticipate that this exception would be provided in limited situations. For example, we would <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=98></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>98</b>  <br/>
consider providing an exception for small issuers, issuers who are only in the individual or small <br/>
group market, financially vulnerable issuers, or new entrants to the market who demonstrate that <br/>
deploying open API technology consistent with the required interoperability standards would <br/>
pose a significant barrier to the issuer’s ability to provide coverage to consumers, and not <br/>
certifying the issuer’s QHP or QHPs would result in consumers having few or no plan options in <br/>
certain areas. We seek comment on other circumstances in which the FFE should consider <br/>
providing an exception. <br/>
j. Applicability and Timing <br/>
At 42 CFR 422.119(h) and 45 CFR 156.221(i), we are proposing specific provisions <br/>
regarding applicability and timing for MA organizations and QHP issuers in FFEs that would be <br/>
subject to our proposal. We are not proposing specific regulation text for 42 CFR 431.60 or <br/>
438.242 because we intend to make the regulation text effective on the applicable date discussed <br/>
below.  We expect that state Medicaid and CHIP agencies will be aware of upcoming new <br/>
regulations and planning for compliance with them when they are effective and applicable, even <br/>
if the new regulation is not yet codified in the CFR; we similarly expect that such agencies will <br/>
ensure that their managed care plans/entities will be prepared for compliance. Unlike Medicaid <br/>
state agencies and managed care plans and state CHIP agencies and managed care entities, MA <br/>
organizations and QHP issuers in FFEs generally are subject to rules regarding bid and <br/>
application submissions to CMS in advance of the coverage period; for example, MA <br/>
organizations must submit bids to CMS by the first Monday in June of the year before coverage <br/>
starts in order to be awarded an MA contract. In order to ensure that these requirements for MA <br/>
organizations and QHP issuers in FFEs are enforceable and reflected in the bids and applications <br/>
these entities submit to us in advance of when the actual requirements must be met, we propose <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=99></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>99</b>  <br/>
to codify the actual compliance and applicability dates of these requirements. We solicit <br/>
comment on this approach. <br/>
For MA organizations, under 42 CFR 422.119(h), we are proposing that the requirements <br/>
would be effective beginning January 1, 2020. Under this proposal, the requirements we propose <br/>
for 42 CFR 422.119 would be applicable for all MA organizations with contracts to offer any <br/>
MA plan on that date and thereafter. We request feedback about this proposed timing from the <br/>
industry. In particular, we are interested in information and request comment from MA <br/>
organizations about their current capability to implement an API consistent with this proposal <br/>
and the costs associated with compliance by January 1, 2020, versus compliance by a future date. <br/>
For Medicaid FFS at 42 CFR 431.60, CHIP agencies that operate FFS systems at 42 CFR <br/>
457.730, Medicaid managed care plans at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6), and CHIP managed care <br/>
entities at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2), we are proposing that the API requirements would be <br/>
effective beginning July 1, 2020, regardless of when the managed care contract started. Given <br/>
the expected date of publication of this proposed rule and potential final rule, we believe July 1, <br/>
2020, would provide state Medicaid agencies and CHIP agencies that operate FFS systems, <br/>
Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP managed care entities sufficient time to implement. We <br/>
solicit comment on this proposal and whether additional flexibility would be necessary to take <br/>
into account the contract terms that states use for their Medicaid managed care plans. <br/>
For CHIP, we are aware that some states do not provide any benefits on a FFS basis, and <br/>
we do not intend for those states to implement an API outside their managed care plans. <br/>
Therefore, we also propose in 42 CFR 457.700(c) that separate CHIP agencies that provide <br/>
benefits exclusively through managed care entities may meet the requirements of 42 CFR <br/>
457.730 by requiring the managed care entities to meet the requirements of 42 CFR <br/>

For QHP issuers in FFEs, we propose in 45 CFR 156.221(i) that these requirements <br/>
would be applicable for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2020. We seek comment on <br/>
the timing of these requirements, and on how long issuers, particularly smaller issuers, anticipate <br/>
it would take to come into compliance with these requirements. <br/>
We believe that these proposals would help to create a health care information ecosystem <br/>
that allows and encourages the health care market to tailor products and services to compete for <br/>
patients, thereby increasing quality, decreasing costs, and helping them live better, healthier <br/>
lives. Additionally, under these proposals, physicians would be able to access information on <br/>
their patient’s current prescriptions and services by reviewing the information with the patient on <br/>
the patient’s personal device or by the patient sharing data with the provider’s EHR system, <br/>
which would save time during appointments and ultimately improve the quality of care delivered <br/>
to beneficiaries. Most health care professionals and consumers have widespread access to the <br/>
internet, providing many access points for viewing health care data over secure connections. We <br/>
believe that these proposed requirements would significantly improve beneficiaries’ experiences <br/>
by providing a secure mechanism through which they can access their data in a standardized, <br/>
computable format. <br/>
These proposals are designed to empower patients by making sure that they have access <br/>
to health information about themselves in a usable digital format and can make decisions about <br/>
how, with whom, and for what uses they will share it.  By making claims data readily available <br/>
and portable to the enrollee, these initiatives support efforts to move our health care system away <br/>
from a FFS payment system that pays for volume and toward a payment system that pays for <br/>
value and quality by reducing duplication of services, adding efficiency to patient visits to <br/>
providers; and, facilitating identification of fraud, waste, and abuse. Data interoperability is <br/>
critical to the success of new payment models and approaches that incentivize high quality, <br/>

efficient care. All of the health care providers for a patient need to coordinate their care for a <br/>
value-based system to work, and that requires information to be securely shareable in <br/>
standardized, computable formats. Moreover, patients need to understand and be actively <br/>
involved in their care under a value-based framework. We are committed to supporting <br/>
requirements that focus on these goals, and we believe that these specific proposals in this <br/>
proposed rule support these efforts.   <br/>
k. Request for Information on Information Sharing Between Payers and Providers through APIs <br/>
This proposed rule requires the implementation of open APIs for making accessible data <br/>
that a third-party could use to create applications for patients to access data in order to coordinate <br/>
and better participate in their medical treatment. While in some instances, direct provider to <br/>
health plan transmission of health information may be more appropriate than sharing data <br/>
through an open API, in other instances a patient may wish to send a provider a copy of their <br/>
health information via another health care provider’s API. In such cases, patients could direct the <br/>
payer to transmit the health information to a third party application (for example, an application <br/>
offered by a health care provider to obtain patient claims and encounter data, as well as lab test <br/>
results (if applicable) on a one-off and as-needed basis. To the extent a HIPAA covered entity <br/>
uses a third party application to offer patients access to their records, another HIPAA covered <br/>
entity may be able to obtain an individual's health information from the app for  treatment, <br/>
payment, or certain health care operations, if it could do so in accordance with HIPAA without <br/>
need of an individual’s authorization. (<i>See</i> 45 CFR 164.506.) Under other laws, providers may <br/>
need to obtain specific individual consent to obtain health information related to care provided <br/>
by a behavioral health provider, treatment received at a substance use disorder treatment facility, <br/>
certain 42 CFR part 2-covered diagnoses or other claims-related information, or labs that suggest <br/>
a part 2 diagnosis. We do not intend to expand any scope of authority to access patient data nor <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=102></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>102</b>  <br/>
to contravene existing requirements related to disclosure of PHI under the HIPAA Rules and <br/>
other legal standards, but instead specify a new and additional mechanism by which to share <br/>
health information as directed by the individual, through the use of API technology in <br/>
compliance with all existing federal, state, local, and tribal privacy and security laws.   <br/>
In the future, we anticipate payers and providers may seek to coordinate care and share <br/>
information in such a way as to request data on providers’ or a plan’s patient/insured overlapping <br/>
population(s) in one transaction.  Effective care coordination between plans and providers can <br/>
inform health care providers about where their patients are receiving care to better understand the <br/>
totality of their healthcare needs and manage their care. We have heard that being aware of <br/>
urgent care or emergency department visits allows clinicians to arrange appropriate follow-up, <br/>
modify treatments, and update records if services are provided (for example, tetanus boosters <br/>
given with a laceration treated in urgent care). The accompanying proposals in Section X. of this <br/>
proposed rule, to amend the conditions of participation regarding notification of patient <br/>
discharge, further support the ability of clinicians to arrange and affirm such appropriate follow-<br/>
up care. Having a complete record of tests done at specialists’ offices can reduce duplicate <br/>
testing. Having a complete list of clinicians caring for a patient facilitates appropriate notification <br/>
if treatments are changed or procedures are planned that may impact the other clinicians’ <br/>
treatment plan. We have heard from participants in our accountable care programs and models <br/>
that organizations taking risk for their patient populations need to have a complete picture of the <br/>
patients’ needs to better budget for appropriate resources. This may be particularly relevant <br/>
during disasters or public health emergencies when patients are not able to access their normal <br/>
sources of care and/or health care facilities are overwhelmed due to patient surge.  <br/>
We believe there are a variety of transmission solutions that may be employed to share <br/>
data regarding a provider’s and plan’s overlapping patient populations. For instance, some <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=103></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>103</b>  <br/>
geographic areas might have regional health information exchanges that could coordinate such <br/>
transmissions. Elsewhere, direct provider-to-provider and plan-to-plan exchange might be more <br/>
appropriate. Plans could participate in direct exchange through existing trusted networks, or <br/>
beneficiary-facing third party applications could meet this potential future requirement.   <br/>
We seek comment for possible consideration in future rulemaking on the feasibility of <br/>
providers being able to request a download on a shared patient population, and whether such a <br/>
process could leverage the APIs described in sections II.A.3. and III.C. of this proposed rule. We <br/>
seek comment on requirements for patient notice and consent, and applicable legal and <br/>
regulatory requirements, and whether or how this data transfer could be cumulative over time <br/>
and between various providers. We seek input on the utility to providers of obtaining all of their <br/>
patients’ utilization history in a timely and comprehensive fashion. We also seek input on <br/>
potential unintended consequences that could result from allowing a provider to access or <br/>
download information about a shared patient population from payers through an open API. <br/>
Finally, we seek comment on the associated burden on plans to exchange this data, as well as the <br/>
identification other potential statutory or regulatory barriers to exchanging this data.  <br/>
<b>IV. API Access to Published Provider Directory Data  </b><br/>
A. Interoperability Background and Use Cases <br/>
The proposals described in section III of this proposed rule primarily focus on patient <br/>
access to their data through a standardized, transparent API; however, we have also proposed <br/>
that entities subject to these proposals make available certain plan-level data through the API. In <br/>
this section, we provide additional context for the proposal related to making provider directory <br/>
information available through the API, including ways in which this proposal may differ from <br/>
our other proposals related to accessibility of patient data.  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=104></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>104</b>  <br/>
Provider directories make key information about health care professionals and <br/>
organizations available to help consumers identify a provider when they enroll in an insurance <br/>
plan or as new health needs arise. For example, such information might include hours of <br/>
operation, languages spoken, specialty/services, availability for new patients. Provider <br/>
directories also function as a resource used by the provider community to discover contact <br/>
information of other providers to facilitate referrals, transitions of care, and care coordination for <br/>
enrollees.    <br/>
The current applicable regulations for MA plans (42 CFR 422.111) and Medicaid and <br/>
CHIP managed care plans (42 CFR 438.10(e)(2)(vi) and (h) and 457.1207, respectively) require <br/>
that provider directories be made available to enrollees and potential enrollees in hard copy and <br/>
on the plan’s website.  Section 1902(a)(83) of the Act requires state Medicaid agencies to publish <br/>
a directory of certain physicians on the public website of the State agency.  A regulation for <br/>
QHPs in FFEs (45 CFR 156.230(b)) requires public access to the QHP’s provider directory in <br/>
addition to distribution and access for enrollees.  In addition to directing that this information be <br/>
accessible, the current regulations also address the content of such directories and the format and <br/>
manner in which MA plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and <br/>
QHP issuers in FFEs make the information available. <br/>
Making this required provider directory information available to enrollees and <br/>
prospective enrollees through an API could support development of applications (whether <br/>
standalone or integrated with providers’ EHR technology) that would pull in current information <br/>
about available providers to meet enrollees’ current needs. For instance, as part of a referral <br/>
lookup use case, API access to a provider directory could allow for a referring provider’s health <br/>
IT to enable either the enrollee or the provider to easily identify up-to-date contact information <br/>
obtained from the directory through an API, and securely send the receiving health care provider <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=105></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>105</b>  <br/>
the patient information needed to provide safe, high-quality care sensitive to the patient’s <br/>
preferences. Broad availability of provider directory data through interoperable API technology <br/>
would also allow for innovation in applications or other services that help enrollees and <br/>
prospective enrollees to more easily compare provider networks while they are considering their <br/>
options for changing health plans. Finally, a consistent, FHIR-based API-driven approach to <br/>
making provider directory data accessible could reduce provider burden by enabling payers/plans <br/>
to share more widely basic information about the providers in their networks, such as provider <br/>
type, specialty, contact information, and whether or not they are accepting new patients.  <br/>
B. Broad API Access to Provider Directory Data <br/>
In sections II.A.3. and III.C. of this proposed rule, we propose to require MA <br/>
organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP <br/>
managed care entities to make standardized information about their provider networks available <br/>
through API technology, so that third party software could access and publish that information.  <br/>
Such availability would be for current enrollees, prospective enrollees and possibly the general <br/>
public to the extent existing regulations require that information to be disclosed beyond current <br/>
enrollees. We propose to require that the API technology conform to the API standards proposed <br/>
by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>).  <br/>
At this time, because QHP issuers in FFEs are already required to make provider directory <br/>
information available in a specified, machine-readable format<a href="CMSs.html#105">29</a>, we do not propose these as <br/>
requirements for QHP issuers. However, we seek comment as to whether this same requirement <br/>
should apply to QHP issuers, or if such a requirement would be overly burdensome for them. <br/>
We note that, since the provider directory information we are proposing to require be <br/>
available through the API is already available and accessible to enrollees without cost to them, <br/>
                                                           <br/>

this information should be as accessible through the API as it is required to be when posted on <br/>
the organization’s websites. Therefore, the security protocols proposed at 45 CFR 170.215 that <br/>
are specific to authenticating users and confirming individuals’ authorization or request to <br/>
disclose their personal information to a specific application would not apply to public access to <br/>
provider directory information through APIs. While we are aware the organization will <br/>
nevertheless need to take appropriate steps to mitigate the potential security risks of allowing any <br/>
application to connect to the API through which it offers provider directory access, we <br/>
emphasize that these steps should be appropriate to the level of risk associated with the specific <br/>
use case of accessing otherwise public information through API technology. Those wishing to <br/>
access this data should not be unduly burdened by security protocols that are not necessary to <br/>
provide the appropriate degree of protection for the organization’s systems and data.<i> </i><br/>
<i> </i><br/>
As referenced in sections II. and III. of this proposed rule, we intend to develop <br/>
additional guidance, incorporating feedback from industry that provides implementation best <br/>
practices relevant to FHIR-conformant open APIs to help organizations subject to the <br/>
requirements proposed in this rulemaking. To that end, we solicit comment on what specific <br/>
resources would be most helpful to organizations implementing APIs under requirements <br/>
proposed in this proposed rule. <br/>
<b>V.  Health Information Exchange and Care Coordination Across Payers:  Establishing a </b><br/>
<b>Coordination of Care Transaction to Communicate Between Plans </b><br/>
We are proposing a new requirement for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, Medicaid <br/>
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHPs in the FFEs to require these plans to <br/>
maintain a process to coordinate care between plans by exchanging, at a minimum, the USCDI at <br/>
enrollee request at the specific times specified in the proposed regulation text.  Understanding <br/>
that this information could  already be available for exchange between plans, this proposal is <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=107></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>107</b>  <br/>
specifically requiring this information sharing not only occur when initiated by an enrollee <br/>
request, but that the information requested, in the form of the USCDI data set, would then be <br/>
incorporated into the recipient plan’s systems. The USCDI (Version 1) data set would have to be <br/>
sent to another plan that covers the enrollee or a recipient identified by the enrollee at any time <br/>
during coverage or up to 5 years after coverage ends, and the plan would have to receive the <br/>
USCDI (version 1) data set from any health plan that covered the enrollee within the preceding 5 <br/>
years.  Under our proposal we are supporting patient directed coordination of care and each of <br/>
the plans subject to the requirement would, upon an enrollee’s request:  (1) accept the data set <br/>
from another plan that had covered the enrollee within the previous 5 years; (2) send the data set <br/>
at any time during an enrollee’s enrollment and up to 5 years later, to another plan that currently <br/>
covers the enrollee; and (3) send the data set at any time during enrollment or up to 5 years after <br/>
enrollment has ended to a recipient identified by the enrollee. <br/>
As we discussed in section III.C.2. of this proposed rule, this proposal is based on our <br/>
authority under sections 1856(b) and 1857(e) of the Act to adopt standards and contract terms for <br/>
MA plans; section 1902(a)(4) of the Act to adopt methods of administration for state Medicaid <br/>
plans, including requirements for Medicaid managed care plans (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs); <br/>
section 2101(a) of the Act for CHIP managed care entities (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs); and <br/>
section 1311(e)(1)(B) of the ACA for QHP issuers in an FFE (not including SADP issuers). We <br/>
believe that our proposal will help to reduce provider burden and improve patient access to their <br/>
health information through coordination of care between health plans. We also note that the <br/>
CHIP regulations incorporate and apply, through an existing cross-reference at 42 CFR <br/>
457.1216, the Medicaid managed care plan requirements codified at 42 CFR 438.62(b)(1)(vi). <br/>
Therefore, the proposal for Medicaid managed care plans described above will also apply to <br/>
CHIP managed care entities without new regulation text in part 457. We are proposing that this <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=108></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>108</b>  <br/>
new requirement would be effective starting January 1, 2020 for MA plans, Medicaid managed <br/>
care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs. Among other topics related to <br/>
this proposal, we solicit comments on this proposed effective date.  <br/>
We propose to codify this new requirement at 42 CFR 422.119(f)(1) for MA <br/>
organizations; at 42 CFR 438.62(b)(1)(vi) for Medicaid managed care plans (and by extension <br/>
under existing rules in part 457, to CHIP managed care entities); and at 45 CFR 156.221(c) for <br/>
QHPs in FFEs.  This proposed new requirement is virtually identical for MA plans, Medicaid <br/>
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs, with modifications <br/>
in the proposal necessary for specific plans types to account for the program needs of the MA <br/>
program, Medicaid and CHIP managed care programs, and QHP program. Our proposed <br/>
regulation text references the content standard adopted at 45 CFR 170.213, which ONC is <br/>
proposing as the USCDI Version 1 data set (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>). We <br/>
believe that exchanging this minimum data would help both plan enrollees and health care <br/>
providers coordinate care and reduce administrative burden to ensure that plans provide <br/>
coordinated high-quality care in an efficient and cost-effective way that protects program <br/>
integrity.   <br/>
Leveraging interoperability to facilitate care coordination among plans can, with <br/>
thoughtful execution, significantly reduce unnecessary care, as well as ensure that health care <br/>
providers are able to spend their time providing care rather than performing unnecessary <br/>
administrative tasks.  We believe that use of the USCDI to exchange information furthers care <br/>
coordination. For instance, effective information exchange between plans could improve care <br/>
coordination by reducing the need for health care providers to write unneeded letters of medical <br/>
necessity; by reducing instances of inappropriate step therapy; and by reducing repeated <br/>
utilization reviews, risk screenings, and assessments. It can also streamline prior authorization <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=109></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>109</b>  <br/>
processes and reduce instances where an enrollee’s health care provider needs to intervene <br/>
personally with the enrollee’s MA plan, Medicaid managed care plan, CHIP managed care <br/>
entity, or QHP in the FFE to ensure his or her patient received the necessary treatment. This <br/>
addresses concerns stakeholders have previously raised with CMS and ONC regarding such <br/>
administrative burdens, as the USCDI standard contains many of the data points required to more <br/>
effectively coordinate care.   <br/>
In addition to the benefits for care coordination at the plan level and reduced provider <br/>
burden, we note that once the combined health information, specified by the USCDI standard, <br/>
from a prior plan is available to the patient’s current plan, the enrollee would also have access to <br/>
multiple years of their health information through the proposed patient access API discussed in <br/>
section III of this proposed rule. The USCDI (Version 1) data set includes laboratory results and <br/>
tests, medications, health concerns, assessment and plan of treatment, care teams, clinical notes, <br/>
and other data points essential for care coordination. This would provide the patient with a more <br/>
comprehensive history of their medical care, helping them to make better informed health care <br/>
decisions. We seek comments on how plans might combine records and address error <br/>
reconciliation or other factors in establishing a more longitudinal record for each patient.  <br/>
We propose to allow multiple methods for electronic exchange of the information, <br/>
including use of the APIs proposed in section III. of this proposed rule, to allow for patient-<br/>
mediated exchange of payer information or direct payer-to-payer communication, subject to <br/>
HIPAA requirements, 42 CFR part 2, and other applicable laws. We considered requiring the use <br/>
of the FHIR-based API discussed in section III. of this proposed rule for the information <br/>
exchange; however, we understand that some geographic areas might have a regional health <br/>
information exchange that could coordinate such transitions for the MA plans, Medicaid <br/>
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHPs in the FFEs that are subject to this <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=110></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>110</b>  <br/>
proposal. We seek comment on whether it would be beneficial to interoperability and patient <br/>
care coordination for us to require the use of the FHIR-based API discussed in section III. of this <br/>
proposed rule, and whether this should be the only mechanism allowed for this exchange, or <br/>
whether multiple methods for electronic exchange of the information should be allowed under <br/>
this proposed policy. <br/>
We also propose that a patient should be able to request his or her information from their <br/>
prior plan up to 5 years after dis-enrollment, which is considerably less than existing data <br/>
retention policies for some of the plans.<a href="CMSs.html#110">30</a> Further, if a plan has access to multiple years of health <br/>
information for a patient, either due to the fact that the patient has been enrolled with the plan for <br/>
multiple years, or because the enrollee has requested transfer of the health information from prior <br/>
plans which previously covered the enrollee, we propose that the health information would be <br/>
incorporated into the IT and data systems of each plan that receives the USCDI data set under <br/>
this proposed requirement, such that the enrollee’s data would be cumulative and move with the <br/>
enrollee as he or she changes enrollment. For example, if a patient is enrolled in Plan 1 in 2020 <br/>
and Plan 2 in 2021, then requests the data from Plan 1 to be sent to Plan 2, Plan 2 would have at <br/>
least 2 years (2020 and 2021) of health information for that patient. If the patient moves to Plan 3 <br/>
in 2022, Plan 3 should receive both 2020 and 2021 data from Plan 2 at the patient’s request. <br/>
While our proposal is to require compliance (and thus exchange of these data sets) only by MA <br/>
plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHPs in the FFEs, we <br/>
hope that compliance by these plans could be the first step toward adoption and implementation <br/>
of these standards on a voluntary basis by other health plans and health issuers throughout the <br/>
health care system. <br/>
                                                           <br/>
30 Under 42 CFR 422.504(d) and 438.3(u), MA organizations and Medicaid managed care plans  and CHIP plans <br/>must retain records for at least 10 years. Under 45 CFR 156.705; 45 CFR 155.1210(b)(2), (3) and (5) QHPs in the <br/>FFEs must also retain records for 10 years. <br/>

Research indicates that the completeness of a patient record and the availability of up-to-<br/>
date and relevant health information at the point of care can have a significant impact on patient <br/>
outcomes.<a href="CMSs.html#111">31 </a>Our proposal here for MA plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care <br/>
entities, and QHPs in the FFEs to exchange a minimum data set in particular scenarios would <br/>
support improvement in care coordination by allowing for sharing of key patient health <br/>
information when an enrollee requests it. The USCDI (Version 1) data set would have to be sent <br/>
to another plan that covers the enrollee or a recipient identified by the enrollee at any time during <br/>
coverage or up to 5 years after coverage ends and the plan would have to receive the USCDI <br/>
(version 1) data set from any health plan that covered the enrollee within the preceding 5 years,. <br/>
We propose that the plans subject to this new requirement would be required to <br/>
exchange, at a minimum, the USCDI Version 1 data set. On behalf of HHS, ONC has proposed <br/>
to adopt the USCDI as a standard (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>), to be codified <br/>
at 45 CFR 170.213, and our proposed regulation text cross-references this regulation. These data <br/>
exchanges would provide the enrollee’s new plan with a core set of data that can be used to <br/>
support better care coordination and improved outcomes for the enrollee. We considered <br/>
requiring plans to exchange all the data that we proposed be available through an API (see <br/>
section III. of this proposed rule) but we understand that ingesting data and reconciling errors has <br/>
challenges and proposed this more limited data set to address those concerns.  We are seeking <br/>
comment on whether the USCDI data set is comprehensive enough to facilitate the type of care <br/>
coordination and patient access described in this proposal, or whether additional data fields and <br/>
data elements that would be available under our API proposal in section III of this proposed rule, <br/>
should also be required. <br/>

Many key attributes of the USCDI make it suitable for the purpose outlined in our <br/>
proposal. The USCDI includes data classes that can be supported by commonly used standards, <br/>
including the Health Level Seven (HL7®) Consolidated Clinical Data Architecture (C-CDA) <br/>
Version 2.1 and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standards for essential <br/>
patient health information like vital signs, lab results, medications and medication allergies. The <br/>
USCDI establishes a minimum set of data elements that would be required to be interoperable <br/>
nationwide and is designed to be expanded in an iterative and predictable way over time. The <br/>
USCDI, at a minimum, transferred for each enrollee moving among the plans subject to our <br/>
proposal would greatly improve each plan’s coordination of care efforts and spotlight areas of <br/>
urgent need. Having this information would allow the new MA plan, Medicaid managed care <br/>
plan, CHIP managed care entity or a QHP in the FFE to evaluate and review an enrollee’s <br/>
utilization history in a timely and comprehensive fashion and thus assist each enrollee to <br/>
transition to the new plan with minimal disruption to care. By being able to perform timely <br/>
outreach to enrollees based on past and current utilization, these plans could take steps to prevent <br/>
unnecessary emergency room visits and lapses in medication and ongoing care; further, they <br/>
could proactively address any network deficiencies that may impact the enrollee. We believe that <br/>
having an enrollee’s utilization history in a timely and comprehensive fashion would facilitate <br/>
outreach and coordination efforts in ways heretofore unavailable on a broad basis. In all, this <br/>
ability would mean that these plans could help new enrollees transition to new coverage rules <br/>
and a new network with minimal disruptions to care.  <br/>
 <br/>
While our proposal is to require, at a minimum, exchange of the USCDI Version 1 data <br/>
set, we reiterate that we do not propose to specify the means of exchanging this data at this time.  <br/>
While we anticipate that plans may opt to use APIs (such as those described in section III of this <br/>
proposed rule) as the means to exchange this data, we intend to not be overly prescriptive as to <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=113></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>113</b>  <br/>
how USCDI data set information for applicable enrollees is exchanged as we expect there are a <br/>
variety of transmission solutions that may be employed. For instance, some geographic areas <br/>
might have a regional health information exchange that could coordinate such transitions for the <br/>
MA plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHPs in the FFEs <br/>
that are subject to this proposal. Elsewhere, direct plan-to-plan exchange might be more <br/>
appropriate, or beneficiary-facing third party applications could be used by MA plans, Medicaid <br/>
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHPs in the FFEs to meet this proposed <br/>
requirement. We also expect there may be instances where these plans may leverage their <br/>
connections to Health Information Exchanges to engage in the information exchanges necessary <br/>
to comply with this proposed rule. We expect enrolled beneficiaries to have constant access to <br/>
requesting an exchange of data as our proposal would require exchange of the USCDI data set <br/>
whenever an enrollee makes such a request, which may occur at times other than enrollment or <br/>
disenrollment. We request comments on other means that the applicable plans may prefer to use <br/>
for meeting this requirement and whether CMS might be able to leverage its program authority <br/>
to facilitate the data exchanges contemplated by this proposal. We acknowledge that in some <br/>
cases plans subject to this proposed requirement may be exchanging patient health information <br/>
with other plans that are not similarly required to exchange USCDI data sets for enrollees, and <br/>
we request comment on how to support patients and providers in those situations.  <br/>
We believe that this proposed requirement would also support dual eligible individuals <br/>
who are concurrently enrolled in MA plans and Medicaid managed care plans. Under our <br/>
proposal, both of the dual eligible individual’s plans would be subject to the requirement to <br/>
exchange that individual’s data in the USCDI Version 1, which should improve the ability of <br/>
both plans to coordinate care based on that data. For example, when an enrollee is initially <br/>
eligible for only one program (that is, only for Medicare and enrolled in a MA plan, or only for <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=114></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>114</b>  <br/>
Medicaid and enrolled in a Medicaid MCO) and then becomes dually eligible for a second <br/>
program, the sharing of data between the existing plan and the new plan reduces the burden on <br/>
the new plan, on the enrollee, and on health care providers in the new plan regarding collecting <br/>
information about prior utilization or health information. Rather than completing a lengthy health <br/>
assessment, the enrollee in this example would benefit from having similar (or possibly the <br/>
same) information transferred directly between the MA plan and the Medicaid managed care <br/>
plan under our proposal. We seek comment on how plans should coordinate care and exchange <br/>
information in those situations. We also seek comment on the associated burden on plans to <br/>
exchange the USCDI data set under our proposal. In addition, we are interested in comments <br/>
about potential legal barriers to exchanging the USCDI data set as would be required under our <br/>
proposal; for example, are there federal, state, local and tribal laws governing privacy for <br/>
specific use cases (such as in the care of minors or for certain behavioral health treatments) that <br/>
raise additional considerations we should address in this regulation or guidance. <br/>
We believe that activities related to this proposal may qualify as a quality improvement <br/>
activity (QIA) meeting the criteria described in section 2718(a)(2) of the PHSA for purposes of <br/>
the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) requirements for QHP issuers in an FFE (excluding SADP <br/>
issuers)<a href="CMSs.html#114">32</a>, and similar standards for treatment of quality improvement standards applicable to <br/>
Medicaid managed care plans (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs) under 42 CFR 438.8, CHIP managed <br/>
care entities under 42 CFR 457.1203(f), and MA plans under 42 CFR 422.2400 through <br/>
422.2490.  We request comments related to this assumption and its implications.  <br/>
                                                           <br/>
32 While this rulemaking is specific to QHP issuers participating in FFEs, we note that to the extent other <br/>commercial market issuers incur similar costs for coverage sold in the individual or group markets, those expenses <br/>may similarly qualify as QIA.  <br/>

<b>VI.  Care Coordination Through Trusted Exchange Networks:  Trust Exchange Network </b><br/>
<b>Requirements for MA Plans, Medicaid Managed Care Plans, CHIP Managed Care </b><br/>
<b>Entities, and QHPs in the FFEs</b>  <br/>
We are proposing to require MA plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed <br/>
care entities, and QHPs in the FFEs (excluding SADP issuers) to participate in trust networks in <br/>
order to improve interoperability in these programs. We would codify this requirement in, <br/>
respectively, 42 CFR 422.119(f)(2), 438.242(b)(5), and 457.1233(d) (which incorporates <br/>
requirements in 42 CFR 438.242(b)(5) by reference) and 45 CFR 156.221.  In general, payers <br/>
and patients’ ability to communicate between themselves and with health care providers could <br/>
considerably improve patient access to data, reduce provider burden, and reduce redundant and <br/>
unnecessary procedures. Trusted exchange networks allow for broader interoperability beyond <br/>
one health system or point to point connections among payers, patients, and providers. Such <br/>
networks establish rules of the road for interoperability, and with maturing technology, such <br/>
networks are scaling interoperability and gathering momentum with participants, including <br/>
several federal agencies, EHR vendors, retail pharmacy chains, large provider associations, and <br/>
others. <br/>
The importance of a trusted exchange framework to such interoperability is reflected in <br/>
section 4003(b) of the Cures Act, as discussed in more detail in section I.D. of this proposed rule. <br/>
A trusted exchange framework allows for the secure exchange of electronic health information <br/>
with, and use of electronic health information from, other health IT without special effort on the <br/>
part of the user. Widespread payer participation in such a framework might allow for more <br/>
complete access and exchange of all electronically accessible health information for authorized <br/>
use under applicable state or federal law, which we believe would lead to better use of such data. <br/>
While we cannot require widespread payer participation in trust networks, we are proposing here <br/>

to use our program authority in the MA program, Medicaid managed care program, CHIP <br/>
managed care program, and QHP certification program for the FFEs to increase participation in <br/>
trust networks and to bring the benefits of such participation to those programs. <br/>
We are proposing to require, effective beginning January 1, 2020, that MA plans, <br/>
Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities and QHPs in the FFEs (excluding not <br/>
stand alone SADPs) participate in a trusted exchange network. This proposal is based on our <br/>
authority under:  sections 1856(b) and 1857(e) of the Act to adopt standards and contract terms <br/>
for MA plans; section 1902(a)(4) of the Act to adopt methods of administration for the <br/>
administration state Medicaid plans, including requirements for Medicaid Managed Care Plans <br/>
(MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs); section 2101(a) for CHIP managed care entities (MCOs, PIHPs, <br/>
and PAHPS); and section 3001(c)(9)(F)(iii) of the Public Health Service Act and section <br/>
1311(e)(1)(B) of the Affordable Care Act for QHP issuers in an FFE. Under our proposal, <br/>
participation would be required in a trusted exchange framework that meets the following <br/>
criteria:  <br/>
(1) The trusted exchange network must be able to exchange PHI, defined in 45 CFR <br/>
160.103, in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws across jurisdictions.  <br/>
(2) The trusted exchange network must be capable of connecting both inpatient EHRs <br/>
and ambulatory EHRs.  <br/>
(3) The trusted exchange network must support secure messaging or electronic querying <br/>
by and between patients, providers and payers.  <br/>
We propose to codify these requirements for these plans at 42 CFR 422.119(f)(2) for MA <br/>
organizations, 438.242(b)(5) for Medicaid managed care plans, 457.1233(d)(2) for CHIP <br/>
managed care entities, and 45 CFR 156.221(d) for QHPs in the FFEs.    <br/>

On January 5, 2018, ONC released the draft Trusted Exchange Framework for public <br/>
comment. Commenters to the draft framework, particularly payers providing comments, <br/>
requested that existing trust networks operating successfully be leveraged in further advancing <br/>
interoperability; thus, we are considering proposing in the future an approach to payer to payer <br/>
and payer to provider interoperability that leverages existing trust networks to support care <br/>
coordination and improve patient access to their data. We request comments on this approach <br/>
and how it might be aligned in the future with section 4003(b) of the Cures Act. We also request <br/>
comments on the effective date we have proposed for this requirement and what benefits and <br/>
challenges the plans (MA organization, Medicare managed care plans, CHIP managed care <br/>
entities and QHPs in the FFE) may face meeting this requirement for additional consideration in <br/>
future rulemaking.  <br/>
We believe that activities related to this proposal may qualify as a QIA meeting the <br/>
criteria described in section 2718(a)(2) of the PHSA for purposes of the MLR requirements for <br/>

A. Increasing the frequency of federal-state data exchanges for dually eligible individuals. <br/>
1.  Background  <br/>
The Medicare and Medicaid programs were originally created as distinct programs with <br/>
different purposes. The programs have different rules for eligibility, covered benefits, and <br/>
payment, and the programs have operated as separate and distinct systems despite a growing <br/>
number of people who depend on both programs for their health care. There is an increasing <br/>
need to align these programs – and the data and systems that support them – to improve care <br/>
delivery and the beneficiary experience for dually eligible beneficiaries, while reducing <br/>
administrative burden for providers, health plans, and states. The interoperability of state and <br/>
CMS eligibility systems is a critical part of modernizing the programs and improving beneficiary <br/>
and provider experiences. Improving the accuracy of data on dual eligibility status by increasing <br/>
the frequency of federal-state data exchanges is a strong first step in improving how these <br/>
systems work together. <br/>
2.  Data Exchanges to Support State Buy-in for Medicare Parts A and B   <br/>
States and CMS routinely exchange data on who is enrolled in Medicare, and which <br/>
parties are liable for paying that beneficiary’s Parts A and B premiums. These data exchanges <br/>
support state, CMS, and SSA premium accounting, collections, and enrollment functions. <br/>
Section 1843 of the Act permits states to enter into an agreement with the Secretary to facilitate <br/>
state “buy-in,” that is, payment of Medicare premiums, in this case Part B premiums, on behalf <br/>
of certain individuals. For those beneficiaries covered under the agreement, the state pays the <br/>
beneficiary’s monthly Part B premium. Section 1818(g) of the Act establishes the option for <br/>
states to amend their buy-in agreement to include enrollment and payment of the Part A premium <br/>
for certain specified individuals. All states and the District of Columbia have a Part B buy-in <br/>
agreement; 36 states and the District of Columbia have a Part A buy-in agreement.    <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=119></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>119</b>  <br/>
To effectuate the state payment of Medicare Part A or Part B premiums, a state submits <br/>
data on a buy-in file to CMS via an electronic file transfer (EFT) exchange setup. The state’s <br/>
input file includes a record for each Medicare beneficiary for whom the state is adding or <br/>
deleting coverage, or changing buy-in status. In response, CMS returns an updated transaction <br/>
record that provides data identifying, for each transaction on the state file, whether CMS <br/>
accepted, modified, or rejected it, as well a Part A or Part B billing record showing the state’s <br/>
premium responsibility. In addition, the CMS file may “push” new updates obtained from SSA <br/>
to the state, for example, changes to the Medicare Beneficiary Identifier number or a change of <br/>
address. <br/>
 <br/>
We have issued regulations for certain details of the state buy-in processes. For Medicare <br/>
Part A, 42 CFR 407.40 describes the option for states to amend the buy-in agreement to cover <br/>
Part A premiums for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs). For Medicare Part B, 42 CFR <br/>
406.26 codifies the process for modifying the buy-in agreement to identify the eligibility groups <br/>
covered. CMS subregulatory guidance, specifically Chapter 3 of the State Buy-in Manual,<a href="CMSs.html#119">34 </a><br/>
specifies that states should exchange buy-in data with CMS at least monthly, but describes the <br/>
option for states to exchange buy-in data with CMS daily or weekly. Likewise, states can choose <br/>
to receive the CMS response data file daily or monthly. We note that 31 states and the District of <br/>
Columbia are now submitting buy-in data to CMS daily; 28 states and the District of Columbia <br/>
are now receiving buy-in response files from CMS daily. <br/>
 <br/>
While many states submit and receive buy-in files daily, some continue to only do so on a <br/>
monthly basis. We have become increasingly concerned about the limitations of monthly buy-in <br/>
data exchanges with states. The relatively long lag in updating buy-in data means that the state is <br/>
                                                           <br/>

not able to terminate or activate buy-in coverage sooner, so the state or beneficiary may be <br/>
paying premiums for longer than appropriate. In most cases, funds must be recouped and <br/>
redistributed –a burdensome administrative process involving debits and payments between the <br/>
beneficiary, state, CMS, and SSA. Additionally, transaction errors do occur in the current data <br/>
exchange processes. In a monthly exchange, it can take multiple months to correct and resubmit <br/>
an improperly processed transaction, exacerbating the delays in appropriately assigning premium <br/>
liability, leading to larger mispayment, recoupment, and redistribution of premiums. <br/>
Exchanging the buy-in data with greater frequency supports more timely access to <br/>
coverage. All states’ systems already have the capacity to exchange buy-in data. We <br/>
acknowledge that states who do not already exchange data daily will need an initial, one-time <br/>
systems change to do so. However, moving to a daily data exchange would result in a net <br/>
reduction of burden for states, and further, reduce administrative complexity for beneficiaries <br/>
and providers. More frequent submission of updates to individuals’ buy-in status positively <br/>
impacts all involved. Based on our experience with the states currently exchanging buy-in data <br/>
daily, we have found: <br/>
•  States can terminate buy-in coverage sooner and lower the risk of paying Part A or Part <br/>
B premiums for individuals once they no longer qualify. Enrollees for whom the buy-in is ending <br/>
have less risk of a retroactive deduction from their Social Security check due to delayed Part B <br/>
buy-in terminations (while 42 CFR 407.48(c) limits retroactive recoupments to a maximum of 2 <br/>
months, an unexpected deduction of up to $268 [2 months of Part B premiums in 2018] is <br/>
significant for those with incomes low enough to be dually eligible); <br/>
•  States can detect and fix errors sooner, limiting the impact of such errors;  <br/>
•  State staff can spread the workload of resolving rejected records across the whole <br/>
month rather than a spike when they receive the monthly CMS response file; <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=121></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>121</b>  <br/>
•  States can effectuate an earlier shift to Medicare as primary payer for many health care <br/>
services, for those already covered by Medicaid;<b> </b>  <br/>
•  Beneficiaries newly eligible for buy-in who had been paying premiums themselves can <br/>
stop having the Part B premium deducted from their Social Security check sooner; and, <br/>
•  Beneficiaries newly eligible for buy-in who could not afford Medicare premiums can <br/>
access Medicare Parts A and B services and providers can be assured of coverage sooner. <br/>
While there exist opportunities to modernize the platform for buy-in data exchange, we <br/>
believe that an important first step is to promote the exchange of the most current available data. <br/>
Section 1843(f) of the Act specifies that Part B buy-in agreements shall contain such provisions <br/>
as will facilitate the financial transactions of the State and the carrier with respect to deductions, <br/>
coinsurance, and otherwise, and as will lead to economy and efficiency of operation” Further, <br/>
section 1818(g)(2)(A) of the Act on Part A buy-in identifies this section 1843(f) requirement as <br/>
applicable to Part A buy-in. While the regulations governing buy-in agreements (see 42 CFR <br/>
406.26 and 407.40) are silent on the frequency of buy-in data exchanges, current guidance <br/>
articulates that the required buy-in data may be submitted daily, weekly, or monthly. We are <br/>
proposing to establish frequency requirements in the regulations at 42 CFR 406.26(a)(1) and <br/>
407.40(c) to require all states to participate in daily exchange of buy-in data to CMS, with <br/>
“daily” meaning every business day, but that if no new transactions are available to transmit, <br/>
data would not need to be submitted on a given business day. We believe these requirements will <br/>
improve the economy and efficiency of operation of the “buy-in” process. We propose that states <br/>
would be required to begin participating in daily exchange of buy-in data with CMS by April 1, <br/>
2022. We believe this effective date will allow states to phase in any necessary operational <br/>
changes or bundle this required change with any new systems implementation. There are 19 <br/>
states that we anticipate will need to make a system change to send buy-in data to CMS daily, <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=122></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>122</b>  <br/>
and 22 states that we anticipate will need to make a system change to receive buy-in data from <br/>
CMS daily. We estimate the one-time cost to be a little less than $80,000 per state, per change. <br/>
So a state that needs to make systems updates to both send buy-in data daily, and receive buy-in <br/>
data daily would have a one-time cost of just under $160,000. We seek comment on these <br/>
proposals. <br/>
3.  Exchange of State MMA Data Files <br/>
States submit data on files at least monthly to CMS to identify all dually eligible <br/>
individuals, including full-benefit and partial-benefit dually eligible beneficiaries (that is, those <br/>
who get Medicaid help with Medicare premiums, and often for cost-sharing). The file is called <br/>
the “MMA file,” but is occasionally referred to as the “State Phasedown file.” The MMA file <br/>
was originally developed to meet the need to timely identify dually eligible beneficiaries for the <br/>
then-new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) <br/>
established that beginning January 1, 2006, Medicare would be primarily responsible for <br/>
prescription drug coverage for full-benefit dually eligible individuals; established auto-<br/>
enrollment of full-benefit dually eligible beneficiaries into Medicare prescription drug plans <br/>
(with regulations further establishing facilitated enrollment into prescription drug plans for <br/>
partial-benefit dually eligible beneficiaries), provided that dually eligible beneficiaries are treated <br/>
as eligible for the Medicare Part D Low Income Subsidy (LIS), sometimes called Extra Help; <br/>
defined phased down state contributions to partly finance Part D costs for dually eligible <br/>
beneficiaries; and required risk-adjusting capitation payments for low-income subsidy (which <br/>
include dually eligible) enrollees of Part D plans. To support these new requirements, we issued <br/>
42 CFR 423.910, establishing monthly reporting by states, in which states would submit, at least <br/>
monthly, a data file identifying dually eligible individuals in their state. Over time, we used these <br/>
files’ data on dual eligibility status to support Part C capitation risk-adjustment, and most <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=123></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>123</b>  <br/>
recently, to feed dual eligibility status to Part A and B eligibility and claims processing systems <br/>
so providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries have accurate information on beneficiary cost-sharing <br/>
obligations.   <br/>
It is required at 42 CFR 423.910 that states to submit at least one MMA file each month. <br/>
However, states have the option to submit multiple MMA files throughout the month (up to one <br/>
per day). Most states submit MMA data files at least weekly; however, only 13 states submit <br/>
MMA data files daily. As CMS now leverages MMA data on dual eligibility status into systems <br/>
supporting all four parts of the Medicare program, it is becoming even more essential that dual <br/>
eligibility status is accurate and up-to-date. Dual eligibility status can change at any time in a <br/>
month. Waiting up to a month for status updates can negatively impact access to the correct level <br/>
of benefit at the correct level of payment. Based on our experience with states that exchange data <br/>
daily, more frequent MMA file submissions benefit states, beneficiaries, and providers, in a <br/>
number of ways including: <br/>
•  Enabling an earlier transition to Medicare coverage for prescription drugs, which <br/>
reduces the number of claims the state pays erroneously and has to recoup from pharmacists (that <br/>
then have the burden of reaching out to reconcile with the new Part D plan); <br/>
•  Effectuating an earlier shift to Medicare as primary payer for many health care <br/>
services;  <br/>
•  Aiding timely error identification and resolution, mitigating the payment and other <br/>
implications of the error;  <br/>
•  Supporting states that promote enrollment in integrated care by expediting the <br/>
enrollment into Medicare, since beneficiaries must have Medicare Parts A and B, as well as <br/>
Medicaid to be eligible for integrated products such as Dual-eligible Special Needs Plans, <br/>
Medicare-Medicaid Plans, and the Programs for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE);   <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=124></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>124</b>  <br/>
•  Supporting beneficiaries to obtain access to Medicare Part D benefits and related <br/>
subsidies sooner, as dual eligibility status on the MMA file prompts CMS to deem individuals <br/>
automatically eligible for the Medicare Part D LIS and make changes to LIS status (for <br/>
example, reducing copayments to $0 when data indicate a move to a nursing facility or use of <br/>
home and community based long term care services) and auto-enroll them into Medicare <br/>
prescription drug coverage back to the start of dual eligibility status; and,  <br/>
•  Promoting protections for QMBs by improving the accuracy of data for providers and <br/>
QMBs on zero cost-sharing liability for services under Medicare Parts A and B.   <br/>
As noted, current regulation requires that the MMA files be submitted at least monthly. <br/>
We have implemented “work-arounds” for lags in dual eligibility status for Part D, including the <br/>
“Best Available Evidence” policy (see 42 CFR 423.800(d)), as well as the Limited Income <br/>
Newly Eligible Transition demonstration, which provides short term drug coverage for dually <br/>
eligible beneficiaries with no Part D plan enrollment in a given month (see Medicare Prescription <br/>
Drug Benefit Manual, Chapter 3, Section 40.1.4).<a href="CMSs.html#124">35</a> While these work-arounds provide needed <br/>
protections, more frequent data exchanges would mitigate the need for them.  <br/>
Ensuring information on dual eligibility status is accurate and up-to-date by increasing <br/>
the frequency of federal-state data exchange is an important step in the path to interoperability. <br/>
As a result, we are proposing to update the frequency requirements in 42 CFR 423.910(d) to <br/>
require that starting April 1, 2022, all states submit the required MMA file data to CMS daily, <br/>
and to make conforming edits to 42 CFR 423.910(b)(1). Daily would mean every business day, <br/>
but that if no new transactions are available to transmit, data would not need to be submitted on a <br/>
                                                           <br/>

to CMS by April 1, 2022, because we believe this effective date will allow states to phase in any <br/>
necessary operational changes or bundle this required change with any new systems <br/>
implementation. There are 37 states and the District of Columbia that we anticipate will need to <br/>
make a system change to send MMA data to CMS daily. We estimate the one-time cost for a <br/>
state to be a little less than $80,000 for this MMA data systems change. For a detailed discussion <br/>
of the costs associated with these requirements we refer readers to section XVI. of this proposed <br/>
rule. We seek comment on these proposals. <br/>
B.  Request for Stakeholder Input   <br/>
In addition to the proposals recommended above, we seek public comment for <br/>
consideration in future rulemaking on how we can achieve greater interoperability of federal-<br/>
state data for dually eligible beneficiaries, including in the areas of program integrity and care <br/>
coordination, coordination of benefits and crossover claims, beneficiary eligibility and <br/>
enrollment, and their underlying data infrastructure. Specifically, we seek comment on: <br/>
•  Whether existing regulations, as well as those proposed here, sufficiently support <br/>
interoperability among those serving dually eligible beneficiaries, and if not, what additional <br/>
steps would advance interoperability. <br/>
•  How to enhance the interoperability of existing CMS processes to share Medicare data <br/>
with states for care coordination and program integrity. <br/>
•  How to improve the CMS and state data infrastructure to support interoperability (for <br/>
example, more frequent data exchanges, common data environment, etc.). <br/>
•  For eligibility, how interoperability can provide timely, integrated eligibility and <br/>
enrollment status across Medicare, Medicaid, and related agencies (for example, SSA), and <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=126></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>126</b>  <br/>
reduce the need for persons to provide, and states to collect/process, the same demographic <br/>
information (for example, address, income). <br/>
•  For provider enrollment in both Medicaid and Medicare, how interoperability can <br/>
streamline provider enrollment and reduce provider and state burden to increase systems <br/>
accuracy and beneficiary utilization of provider enrollment data (for example, disability <br/>
competence, hours of service, types of insurance accepted, etc.). <br/>
•  For coordination of benefits, including crossover claims, the underlying changes that <br/>
would need to be made to support interoperability (for example, coding, file formats, <br/>
provider/beneficiary identifier, and encounter versus FFS data).  <br/>
Please include specific examples when possible while avoiding the transmission of <br/>
protected information. Please also include a point of contact who can provide additional information <br/>
upon request.   <br/>
<b>VIII. Information Blocking Background and Public Reporting </b><br/>
A. Information Blocking Background <br/>
1. Legislative Background and Policy Considerations <br/>
The nature and extent of information blocking has come into focus in recent years. In <br/>
2015, at the request of the Congress, ONC submitted a Report on Health Information <br/>
Blocking<a href="CMSs.html#126">36 </a>(hereinafter referred to as the “Information Blocking Congressional Report”), in <br/>
which ONC commented on the then current state of technology, health IT, and health care <br/>
markets. Notably, ONC observed that prevailing market conditions create incentives for some <br/>
individuals and entities to exercise their control over electronic health information in ways that <br/>
limit its availability and use. Since that time, ONC and other divisions of HHS have continued <br/>
                                                           <br/>
36 ONC, Report to Congress on Health Information Blocking (Apr. 2015), <br/><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/reports/info_blocking_040915.pdf">https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/reports/info_blocking_040915.pdf. </a><br/>

<a name=127></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>127</b>  <br/>
to receive feedback regarding practices which may constitute information blocking from <br/>
patients, clinicians, health care executives, payers, app developers and other technology <br/>
companies, registries and health information exchanges, professional and trade associations, and <br/>
many other stakeholders. Despite significant public and private sector efforts to improve <br/>
interoperability and data liquidity, engagement with stakeholders confirms that adverse <br/>
incentives remain and continue to undermine progress toward a more connected health system.  <br/>
Based on these economic realities and first-hand experience working with the health IT <br/>
industry and stakeholders, ONC concluded in the Information Blocking Congressional Report <br/>
that information blocking is a serious problem and recommended that the Congress prohibit <br/>
information blocking and provide penalties and enforcement mechanisms to deter these harmful <br/>
practices.  <br/>
MACRA became law in the same month that the Information Blocking Congressional <br/>
Report was published. Section 106(b)(2)(A) of MACRA amended section 1848(o)(2)(A)(ii) of <br/>
the Act to require that an eligible professional must demonstrate that he or she has not knowingly <br/>
and willfully taken action (such as to disable functionality) to limit or restrict the compatibility or <br/>
interoperability of certified EHR technology, as part of being a meaningful EHR user. Section <br/>
106(b)(2)(B) of MACRA made corresponding amendments to section 1886(n)(3)(A)(ii) of the <br/>
Act for eligible hospitals and, by extension, under section 1814(l)(3) of the Act for CAHs. <br/>
Sections 106(b)(2)(A) and (B) of MACRA provide that the manner of this demonstration is to be <br/>
through a process specified by the Secretary, such as the use of an attestation. To implement <br/>
these provisions, as discussed further below, we established and codified attestation requirements <br/>
to support the prevention of information blocking, which consist of three statements containing <br/>
specific representations about a health care provider’s implementation and use of CEHRT. To <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=128></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>128</b>  <br/>
review our discussion of these requirements, we refer readers to the CY 2017 Quality Payment <br/>
Program final rule (81 FR 77028 through 77035). <br/>
Recent empirical and economic research further underscores the complexity of the <br/>
information blocking problem and its harmful effects. In a national survey of health information <br/>
organizations, half of respondents reported that EHR developers routinely engage in <br/>
information blocking, and a quarter of respondents reported that hospitals and health systems <br/>
routinely do so.<a href="CMSs.html#128">37</a> Perceived motivations for information blocking described by respondents <br/>
included, for EHR vendors, maximizing short term revenue and competing for new clients, and <br/>
for hospitals and health systems, strengthening their competitive position relative to other <br/>
hospitals and health systems. Other research suggests that these practices weaken competition <br/>
among health care providers by limiting patient mobility, encouraging consolidation, and <br/>
creating barriers to entry for developers of new and innovative applications and technologies <br/>
that enable more effective uses of clinical data to improve population health and the patient <br/>
experience.<a href="CMSs.html#128">38</a>  <br/>
In December 2016, section 4004 of the Cures Act added section 3022 of the PHSA (the <br/>
“PHSA information blocking provision”), which defines conduct by health care providers, <br/>
health IT developers, and health information exchanges and networks, that constitutes <br/>
information blocking. The PHSA information blocking provision was enacted in response to <br/>
ongoing concerns that some individuals and entities are engaging in practices that unreasonably <br/>
                                                           <br/>
37 See, for example, Julia Adler-Milstein and Eric Pfeifer, Information Blocking: Is It Occurring And What Policy <br/>Strategies Can Address It?, 95 Milbank Quarterly 117, 124–25 (Mar. 2017), available at <br/><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12247/full">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12247/full.</a>  <br/>38 See, for example, Martin Gaynor, Farzad Mostashari, and Paul B.

limit the availability and use of electronic health information for authorized and permitted <br/>
purposes (see the definition of electronic health information proposed by ONC for HHS <br/>
adoption at 45 CFR 171.102 (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>)). These practices <br/>
undermine public and private sector investments in the nation’s health IT infrastructure and <br/>
frustrate efforts to use modern technologies to improve health care quality and efficiency, <br/>
accelerate research and innovation, and provide greater value and choice to health care <br/>
consumers.  <br/>
 <br/>
The information blocking provision added to PHSA defines and creates possible penalties <br/>
and disincentives for information blocking in broad terms, working to deter the entire spectrum <br/>
of practices likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of <br/>
electronic health information. The PHSA information blocking provision applies to health care <br/>
providers, health IT developers, exchanges, and networks. The information blocking provision <br/>
added to PHSA by the Cures Act also provides that the “Secretary, through rulemaking, shall <br/>
identify reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking for <br/>
purposes of the definition at section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA.” ONC has taken the lead on this <br/>
rulemaking effort, and in addition to the attestation discussed in this section, all health care <br/>
providers would also be subject to the separate information blocking regulations proposed by <br/>
ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR part 171 (published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>).   <br/>
We propose to publicly report certain information about eligible clinicians’ attestations <br/>
under the QPP on Physician Compare and eligible hospitals’ and CAHs’ attestations under the <br/>
Medicare FFS Promoting Interoperability Program (previously known as the Medicare EHR <br/>
Incentive Program) on a CMS website. As discussed below, although we have already <br/>
implemented what is required by sections 106(b)(2)(A) and (B) of MACRA through the <br/>
attestation requirements we have established in prior rulemaking (81 FR 77028 through 77035), <br/>

<a name=130></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>

<b>130</b>  <br/>
we believe publishing information on which eligible clinicians, eligible hospitals, and CAHs <br/>
have negatively attested that they have not knowingly and willfully taken action to limit or <br/>
restrict the compatibility or interoperability of certified EHR technology would serve to <br/>
discourage knowing and willful behavior that limits interoperability and prevents the sharing of <br/>
information discussed in both MACRA and the Cures Act.  <br/>
B.  Public Reporting and Prevention of Information Blocking on Physician Compare <br/>
Physician Compare <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare">(http://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare)</a> draws its operating <br/>
authority from section 10331(a)(1) of the Affordable Care Act. Consistent with section <br/>
10331(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, Physician Compare initiated a phased approach to <br/>
publicly reporting performance scores that provide comparable information on quality and <br/>
patient experience measures. A complete history of public reporting on Physician Compare is <br/>
detailed in the CY 2016 Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) final rule with comment period (80 FR <br/>
71117 through 71122).  More information about Physician Compare, including the history of <br/>
public reporting and regular updates about what information is currently available, can also be <br/>
accessed on the Physician Compare Initiative website a<a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/physician-compare-initiative/">t https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/physician-compare-initiative/">initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/physician-compare-initiative/. </a> <br/>
As discussed in the CY 2018 Quality Payment Program final rule (82 FR 53820), <br/>
Physician Compare has continued to pursue a phased approach to public reporting under <br/>
MACRA in accordance with section 1848(q)(9) of the Act. Specifically, subparagraphs (A) and <br/>
(D) of section 1848(q)(9) of the Act facilitate the continuation of the phased approach to public <br/>
reporting by requiring the Secretary to make available on the Physician Compare Website, in an <br/>
easily understandable format, individual MIPS eligible clinician and group performance <br/>
information, including: the MIPS eligible clinician’s final score; the MIPS eligible clinician’s <br/>
performance under each MIPS performance category (quality, cost, improvement activities, and <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=131></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>131</b>  <br/>
Promoting Interoperability); names of eligible clinicians in Advanced APMs and, to the extent <br/>
feasible, the names of such Advanced APMs and the performance of such models; and, <br/>
aggregate information on the MIPS, posted periodically, including the range of final scores for <br/>
all MIPS eligible clinicians and the range of the performance of all MIPS eligible clinicians for <br/>
each performance category.  <br/>
In the CY 2018 Quality Payment Program final rule (82 FR 53827), we finalized a policy <br/>
to include an indicator on Physician Compare, as technically feasible, for any eligible clinician or <br/>
group who successfully meets the Promoting Interoperability performance category. We also <br/>
finalized a policy to include, as technically feasible, additional information on Physician <br/>
Compare, either on the profile pages or in the downloadable database, including, but not limited <br/>
to objectives, activities, or measures specified in the CY 2018 Quality Payment Program final <br/>
rule (82 FR 53827; see 82 FR 53663 through 53688) with respect to the Promoting <br/>
Interoperability performance category. <br/>
Generally, all data available for public reporting on Physician Compare must meet our <br/>
established public reporting standards under 42 CFR 414.1395(b). In addition, for each program <br/>
year, CMS provides a 30-day preview period for any clinician or group with QPP data being <br/>
publicly reported on Physician Compare under 42 CFR 414.1395(d). All data available for public <br/>
reporting – such as final scores – are available for review and correction during the targeted <br/>
review process as finalized in the CY 2017 Quality Payment Program final rule (81 FR 77392).  <br/>
Building upon the continuation of our phased approach to public reporting and <br/>
understanding the importance of preventing information blocking, promoting interoperability and <br/>
the sharing of information, we propose to make certain data about the attestation statements on <br/>
the prevention of information blocking referenced earlier in section VIII.A. of this proposed rule <br/>
available for public reporting on Physician Compare, drawing upon our authority under section <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=132></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>132</b>  <br/>
10331(a)(2) of Affordable Care Act, which requires us to make publicly available on Physician <br/>
Compare information on physician performance that provides comparable information for the <br/>
public on quality and patient experience measures. Section 10331(a)(2) of the Affordable Care <br/>
Act provides that to the extent scientifically sound measures that are developed consistent with <br/>
the requirements of section 10331 of the Affordable Care Act are available, such information <br/>
shall include, to the extent practicable, an assessment of the coordination of care and other <br/>
information as determined appropriate by the Secretary. We believe section 10331(a)(2) of the <br/>
Affordable Care Act provides the statutory authority to publicly report certain data about the <br/>
prevention of information blocking attestation statements as an assessment of care coordination <br/>
and as other information determined appropriate by the Secretary. Furthermore, the prevention of <br/>
information blocking attestation statements are required for a clinician to earn a Promoting <br/>
Interoperability performance category score, which is then incorporated into the final score for <br/>
MIPS, and we are required to publicly report both of these scores under section 1848(q)(9)(A) of <br/>
the Act. Publicly posting this information as an indicator is consistent with our finalized policy to <br/>
publicly report, either on the profile pages or in the downloadable database, other aspects of the <br/>
Promoting Interoperability performance category, such as objectives, activities, or measures <br/>
specified in the CY 2018 Quality Payment Program final rule. <br/>
There are three prevention of information blocking attestation statements under 42 CFR <br/>
414.1375(b)(3)(ii)(A) through (C) to which eligible clinicians reporting on the Promoting <br/>
Interoperability performance category of MIPS must attest. To report successfully on the <br/>
Promoting Interoperability performance category, in addition to satisfying other requirements, an <br/>
eligible clinician must submit an attestation response of “yes” for each of these statements. For <br/>
more information about these statements, we refer readers to the preamble discussion in the CY <br/>
2017 Quality Payment Program final rule (81 FR 77028 through 81 FR 77035).  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=133></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>133</b>  <br/>
We believe it would benefit the public to know if eligible clinicians have attested <br/>
negatively to the statements under 42 CFR 414.1375(b)(3)(ii) as this may assist the patient in <br/>
selecting a clinician or group who collaborates with other clinicians, groups, or other types of <br/>
health care providers by sharing information electronically, and does not withhold information <br/>
that may result in better care. Therefore, we are proposing to include an indicator on Physician <br/>
Compare for the eligible clinicians and groups that submit a “no” response to any of the three <br/>
statements under 42 CFR 414.1375(b)(3)(ii)(A) through (C). In the event that these statements <br/>
are left blank, that is, a “yes” or a “no” response is not submitted, the attestations would be <br/>
considered incomplete, and we would not include an indicator on Physician Compare. We also <br/>
propose to post this indicator on Physician Compare, either on the profile pages or the <br/>
downloadable database, as feasible and appropriate, starting with the 2019 performance period <br/>
data available for public reporting starting in late 2020.  <br/>
Under 42 CFR 414.1395(b), these data must meet our established public reporting <br/>
standards, including that to be included on the public facing profile pages, the data must resonate <br/>
with website users, as determined by CMS. In previous testing with patients and caregivers, we <br/>
have learned that effective use of CEHRT is important to them when making informed health <br/>
care decisions. To determine how to best display and meaningfully communicate the indicator on <br/>
the Physician Compare website, the exact wording and, if applicable, profile page indicator <br/>
would be determined after user testing and shared with stakeholders through the Physician <br/>
Compare Initiative page, listservs, webinars, and other available communication channels. We <br/>
note this proposal is contingent upon the availability of and technical feasibility to use these data <br/>
for public reporting. We request comment on this proposal. <br/>

C. Public Reporting and Prevention of Information Blocking for Eligible Hospitals and Critical <br/>
Access Hospitals (CAHs)  <br/>
Section 1886(n)(4)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to post in an easily <br/>
understandable format a list of the names and other relevant data, as determined appropriate by <br/>
the Secretary, of eligible hospitals and CAHs who are meaningful EHR users under the Medicare <br/>
FFS program, on a CMS website. In addition, that section requires the Secretary to ensure that an <br/>
eligible hospital or CAH has the opportunity to review the other relevant data that are to be made <br/>
public with respect to the eligible hospital or CAH prior to such data being made public. We <br/>
believe certain information related to the prevention of information blocking attestation <br/>
statements under 42 CFR 495.40(b)(2)(i)(I)(<i>1</i>) through (<i>3</i>) would constitute other relevant data <br/>
under section 1886(n)(4)(B) of the Act.  Specifically, we are referring to the three prevention of <br/>
information blocking attestation statements under 42 CFR 495.40(b)(2)(i)(I)(1) through (3) to <br/>
which eligible hospitals and CAHs must attest for purposes of the Promoting Interoperability <br/>
Program. As part of successfully demonstrating that an eligible hospital or CAH is a meaningful <br/>
EHR user for purposes of the Promoting Interoperability Program, the eligible hospital or CAH <br/>
must submit an attestation response of “yes” for each of these statements. For more information <br/>
about these statements, we refer readers to the preamble discussion in the CY 2017 Quality <br/>
Payment Program final rule (81 FR 77028 through 81 FR 77035). <br/>
We believe it would be relevant to the public to know if eligible hospitals and CAHs have <br/>
attested negatively to the statements under 42 CFR 495.40(b)(2)(i)(I)(1) through (3) as it could <br/>
indicate that they are knowingly and unreasonably interfering with the exchange or use of <br/>
electronic health information in ways that limit its availability and use to improve health care. As <br/>
we stated in the CY 2017 Quality Payment Program final rule, we believe that addressing issues <br/>
related to information blocking would require additional and more comprehensive measures (81 <br/>
<hr/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>135</b>  <br/>
FR 77029). In addition, publicly posting this information would reinforce our commitment to <br/>
focus on increased interoperability and the appropriate exchange of health information. We <br/>
propose to post information on a CMS website available to the public indicating that an eligible <br/>
hospital or CAH attesting under the Medicare FFS Promoting Interoperability Program <br/>
submitted a “no” response to any of the three statements under 42 CFR 495.40(b)(2)(i)(I)(1) <br/>
through (3). In the event that these statements are left blank, that is, a “yes” or a “no” response is <br/>
not submitted, the attestations would be considered incomplete, and we would not post any <br/>
information related to these attestation statements for that hospital or CAH. We propose to post <br/>
this information starting with the attestations for the EHR reporting period in 2019, and we <br/>
expect the information would be posted in late 2020.  In accordance with section 1886(n)(4)(B) <br/>
of the Act, we propose to establish a process for each eligible hospital and CAH to review the <br/>
information related to their specific prevention of information blocking attestation statements <br/>
before it is publicly posted on a CMS website. Specifically, for each program year, we propose a <br/>
30-day preview period for an eligible hospital or CAH to review this information before it is <br/>
publicly posted. During the 30-day preview period, we propose that all of the information that <br/>
we would publicly post would be available for the eligible hospital or CAH to review, and we <br/>
would consider making changes to the information on a case-by-case basis (for example, in the <br/>
event the eligible hospital or CAH identifies an error, and we subsequently determine that the <br/>
information is not accurate). Additional information on the review process will be provided <br/>
outside of the rulemaking process through the usual communication channels for the program. <br/>
We invite comments on this proposal. <br/>

<b>IX.  Provider Digital Contact Information </b> <br/>
A. Background <br/>
Congress required the Secretary to create a provider digital contact information index in <br/>
section 4003 of the Cures Act. This index must include all individual health care providers and <br/>
health care facilities, or practices, in order to facilitate a comprehensive and open exchange of <br/>
patient health information. Congress gave the Secretary the authority to use an existing index or <br/>
to facilitate the creation of a new index. In comments received on the FY 2019 IPPS proposed <br/>
rule RFI, there was strong support for a single, public directory of provider digital contact <br/>
information. Commenters noted that digital communication could improve interoperability by <br/>
facilitating efficient exchange of patient records, eliminating the burden of working with scanned <br/>
paper documents, and ultimately enhancing care coordination. <br/>
To ensure the index is accessible to all clinicians and facilities, we have updated the <br/>
NPPES<a href="CMSs.html#136">39 </a>to be able to capture digital contact information for both individuals and facilities. <br/>
NPPES currently supplies National Provider Identifier (NPI) numbers to health care providers <br/>
(both individuals and facilities), maintains their NPI record, and publishes the records online.<a href="CMSs.html#136">40</a>  <br/>
The Secretary adopted the NPI as the HIPAA administrative simplification standard identifier for <br/>
health care providers (69 FR 3434). HIPAA covered entities, including health care providers, <br/>
health plans, and health care clearinghouses, must use the NPI in HIPAA transactions. All health <br/>
care providers that transmit health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA <br/>
transaction must obtain an NPI. <br/>
Health care providers are required to communicate to the NPPES any information that <br/>
has changed within 30 days of the change (45 CFR 162.410(a)(4)). CMS reviews NPPES to <br/>
                                                           <br/>
39 The NPPES Web site is available a<a href="https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/">t https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/.</a> <br/>40 S<a href="https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/">ee https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/.</a> <br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>137</b>  <br/>
ensure a provider has a valid NPI as part of the Medicare enrollment process, as well as the <br/>
revalidation process, which occurs every 3 to 5 years depending on the provider or supplier type.  <br/>
Information in NPPES is publicly accessible via both an online search option and a <br/>
downloadable database option. As a result, adding digital contact information to this existing <br/>
index is an efficient and effective way to meet the Congressional requirement to establish a <br/>
digital contact information index and to promote the sharing of information.  <br/>
As of June 2018, NPPES has been updated to include the capability to capture one or <br/>
more pieces of digital contact information that can be used to facilitate secure sharing of health <br/>
information. For instance, providers can submit a Direct address, which functions similar to a <br/>
regular e-mail address, but includes additional security measures to ensure that messages are <br/>
only accessible to the intended recipient in order to keep the information confidential and secure. <br/>
“Direct” is a technical standard for exchanging health information. Direct addresses are available <br/>
from a variety of sources, including EHR vendors, State Health Information Exchange entities, <br/>
regional and local Health Information Exchange entities, as well as private service providers <br/>
offering Direct exchange capabilities called Health Information Service Providers (HISPs) <br/>
<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/directbasicsforprovidersqa_05092014.pdf">(https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/directbasicsforprovidersqa_05092014.pdf)</a>. NPPES <br/>
can also capture information about a wide range of other types of endpoints that providers can <br/>
use to facilitate secure exchange of health information, for instance a FHIR server URL or query <br/>
endpoint associated with a health information exchange.  <br/>
In addition, NPPES can now maintain information about the type of contact information <br/>
providers and organizations are associated with, along with the preferred uses for each address. <br/>
Each provider in NPPES can maintain their own unique information or associate themselves with <br/>
information shared among a group of providers. Finally, NPPES has also added a public API <br/>
which can be used to obtain contact information stored in the database. Although NPPES is now <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=138></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>138</b>  <br/>
better equipped to maintain provider digital contact information, many providers have not <br/>
submitted this information. In the 2015 final rule, “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Electronic <br/>
Health Record Incentive Program-Stage 3 and Modifications to Meaningful Use in 2015 <br/>
Through 2017” (80 FR 62901), we finalized a policy to collect information in NPPES about the <br/>
electronic addresses of participants in the EHR Incentive Program (specifically, a Direct address <br/>
and/or other “electronic service information” as available). However, this policy was not fully <br/>
implemented at the time, in part due to the limitations of the NPPES system which have since <br/>
been addressed. As a result, many providers have not yet added their digital contact information <br/>
to NPPES and digital contact information is frequently out of date.  <br/>
In light of these updates to the NPPES system, all individual health care providers and <br/>
facilities can take immediate action to update their NPPES record online to add digital contact <br/>
information. This simple step will significantly improve interoperability by making valuable <br/>
contact information easily accessible. For those providers who continue to rely on the use of <br/>
cumbersome, fax-based modes of sharing information, we hope that greater availability of digital <br/>
contact information will help to reduce barriers to electronic communication with a wider set of <br/>
providers with whom they share patients. Ubiquitous, public availability of digital contact <br/>
information for all providers is a crucial step towards eliminating the use of fax machines for the <br/>
exchange of health information. We urge all providers to take advantage of this resource to <br/>
implement Congress’ requirement that the Secretary establish a digital contact information index.   <br/>
B. Proposed Public Reporting of Missing Digital Contact Information <br/>
Entities seeking to engage in electronic health information exchange need accurate <br/>
information about the electronic addresses (for example, Direct address, FHIR server URL, <br/>
query endpoint, or other digital contact information) of potential exchange partners. A common <br/>
directory of the electronic addresses of health care providers and organizations could enhance <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=139></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>139</b>  <br/>
interoperability and information exchange by providing a resource where users can obtain <br/>
information about how to securely transmit electronic health information to a provider.  <br/>
We propose to increase the number of providers with valid and current digital contact <br/>
information available through NPPES by publicly reporting the names and NPIs of those <br/>
providers who do not have digital contact information included in the NPPES system. We <br/>
propose to begin this public reporting in the second half of 2020, to allow individuals and <br/>
facilities time to review their records in NPPES and update the system with appropriate digital <br/>
contact information. We are also requesting comment from stakeholders on the most appropriate <br/>
way to pursue this public reporting initiative, including where these names should be posted, <br/>
with what frequency, and any other information stakeholders believe would be helpful.  <br/>
We believe this information is extremely valuable to facilitate interoperability, and we <br/>
appreciate Congress’ leadership in requiring the establishment of this directory. We are <br/>
interested in stakeholder comment on additional possible enforcement authorities to ensure that <br/>
individuals and facilities make their digital contact information publicly available through <br/>
NPPES. For example, should Medicare reporting programs, such as MIPS, require eligible <br/>
clinicians to update their NPPES data with their digital contact information? Should CMS <br/>
require this information to be included as part of the Medicare enrollment and revalidation <br/>
process? How can CMS work with states to promote adding information to the directory through <br/>
state Medicaid programs and CHIP? Should CMS require providers to submit digital contact <br/>
information as part of program integrity processes related to prior authorization and submission <br/>
of medical record documentation? We will review comments for possible consideration in future <br/>
rulemaking on these questions. <br/>

<b>(CAHs)</b> <br/>
A. Background <br/>
As noted earlier in this proposed rule, CMS appreciates the pathways Congress has <br/>
created for action on interoperability and has been working diligently with ONC to implement <br/>
them. In order to ensure broad stakeholder input to inform our proposals, we published a Request <br/>
for Information (RFI) on interoperability in several recently published proposed rules, including <br/>
the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule (83 FR 20550). Specifically, we published the RFI entitled, <br/>
“Promoting Interoperability and Electronic Healthcare Information Exchange Through Possible <br/>
Revisions to the CMS Patient Health and Safety Requirements for Hospitals and Other <br/>
Medicare- and Medicaid-Participating Providers and Suppliers.” We requested stakeholders’ <br/>
input on how we could use the CMS health and safety standards that are required for providers <br/>
and suppliers participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs (that is, the Conditions of <br/>
Participation (CoPs), Conditions for Coverage (CfCs), and Requirements for Participation (RfPs) <br/>
for long term care facilities) to further advance electronic exchange of information that supports <br/>
safe, effective transitions of care between hospitals and community providers. Specifically, we <br/>
asked for comment on revisions to the current CMS CoPs for hospitals such as: requiring that <br/>
hospitals transferring medically necessary information to another facility upon a patient transfer <br/>
or discharge do so electronically; requiring that hospitals electronically send required discharge <br/>
information to a community provider via electronic means if possible and if a community <br/>
provider can be identified; and, requiring that hospitals make certain information available to <br/>
patients or a specified third-party application (for example, required discharge instructions) via <br/>
electronic means if requested. <br/>

<b>141</b>  <br/>
The RFI discussed several steps we have taken in recent years to update and modernize <br/>
the CoPs and other health and safety standards to reflect current best practices for clinical care, <br/>
especially in the area of care coordination and discharge planning. On November 3, 2015, we <br/>
published a proposed rule, “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Revisions to Requirements for <br/>
Discharge Planning for Hospitals, Critical Access Hospitals, and Home Health Agencies” (80 FR <br/>
68126), to implement the discharge planning requirements of the IMPACT Act and to revise the <br/>
discharge planning CoP requirements that hospitals (including short-term acute care hospitals, <br/>
LTCHs, rehabilitation hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, children's hospitals, and cancer hospitals), <br/>
CAHs, and HHAs must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The <br/>
final rule in response to public comment on our proposed new requirements for discharge <br/>
planning for hospitals, CAHs, and HHAs is under development while we review and respond to <br/>
public comments (our deadline to finalize this rule is November 3, 2019). Several of the <br/>
proposed requirements from the 2015 Discharge Planning proposed rule directly addressed the <br/>
issue of communication between providers and between providers and patients, as well as the <br/>
issue of interoperability: <br/>
●  Hospitals and CAHs would be required to transfer certain necessary medical <br/>
information and a copy of the discharge instructions and discharge summary to the patient's <br/>
practitioner, if the practitioner is known and has been clearly identified; <br/>
●  Hospitals and CAHs would be required to send certain necessary medical information <br/>
to the receiving facility/PAC providers, at the time of discharge; and, <br/>
●  Hospitals, CAHs, and HHAs would need to comply with the IMPACT Act <br/>
requirements that would require hospitals, CAHs, and certain PAC providers to use data on <br/>
quality measures and data on resource use measures to assist patients during the discharge <br/>
planning process, while taking into account the patient's goals of care and treatment preferences. <br/>

We also published the “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Hospital and Critical Access <br/>
Hospital Changes to Promote Innovation, Flexibility and Improvement in Patient Care” proposed <br/>
rule (81 FR 39448) on June 16, 2016, which is under development while we review and respond <br/>
to public comments (our deadline to finalize this rule is June 15, 2019). In that rule, we proposed <br/>
updating a number of CoP requirements that hospitals and CAHs would have to meet to <br/>
participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. One of the proposed hospital CoP revisions <br/>
directly addressed the issues of communication between providers and patients, patient access to <br/>
their medical records, and interoperability. We proposed that patients have the right to access <br/>
their medical records, including current medical records, upon an oral or written request, in the <br/>
form and format requested by such patients, if the information is readily producible in such form <br/>
and format (including in an electronic form or format when such medical records are maintained <br/>
electronically); or, if not, in a readable hard copy form or such other form and format as agreed <br/>
to by the facility and the individual, and within a reasonable timeframe. Under the proposal, a <br/>
hospital could not frustrate the legitimate efforts of individuals to gain access to their own <br/>
medical records and would be required to meet these patient requests as quickly as record <br/>
keeping systems permit. <br/>
In response to the recent RFI in the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule, many stakeholders <br/>
supported our goals of increasing interoperability and acknowledged the important role that <br/>
hospital settings play in supporting care coordination. Stakeholders agreed that use of electronic <br/>
technology was an important factor in ensuring safe transitions. At the same time, many <br/>
stakeholders expressed concerns about implementing policy changes within the CoPs, which <br/>
may increase the compliance burden on hospitals. <br/>
Given responses to the recent RFI, as well as previous rulemaking activities, we are <br/>
seeking to further expand CMS requirements for interoperability within the hospital and CAH <br/>

CoPs as part of this proposed rulemaking by focusing on electronic patient event notifications. In <br/>
addition, we are committed to taking further steps to ensure that facilities that are electronically <br/>
capturing information are electronically exchanging that information with providers who have <br/>
the capacity to accept it. We expect that this will be required through rulemaking at a future point <br/>
in time, with one option being alignment with the TEFCA described in section 4003 of the Cures <br/>
Act. We will also continue to consider the RFI responses as we pursue this goal in future <br/>
rulemaking. <br/>
Infrastructure supporting the exchange of electronic health information across settings <br/>
has matured substantially in recent years. Research studies have increasingly found that health <br/>
information exchange interventions can effect positive outcomes in health care quality and public <br/>
health, in addition to more longstanding findings around reductions in utilization and costs. A <br/>
recent review of how health information exchange interventions can improve cost and quality <br/>
outcomes identified a growing body of high-quality studies showing that these interventions are <br/>
associated with beneficial results.<a href="CMSs.html#143">41</a> The authors identified a number of studies demonstrating <br/>
positive effects on outcomes associated with better care coordination, such as reductions in 30-<br/>

Electronic patient event notifications from hospitals, or clinical event notifications, are <br/>
one type of health information exchange intervention that has been increasingly recognized as an <br/>
effective and scalable tool for improving care coordination across settings, especially for patients <br/>
at discharge. This approach has been identified with a reduction in readmissions following <br/>
implementation.<a href="CMSs.html#144">46 </a>We note that the evidence cited in this section to support the use of innovative <br/>
health information exchange interventions and approaches, such as the patient event notifications <br/>
that we are proposing to require in this rule, can be applied to various types of hospitals, <br/>
including psychiatric hospitals, as well as to CAHs, as discussed below. <br/>
Patient event notifications are automated, electronic communications from the <br/>
discharging provider to another facility, or to another community provider as identified by the <br/>
patient, which alerts the receiving provider that the patient has received care at a different <br/>
setting. Depending on the implementation, information included with these notifications can <br/>
range from conveying the patient’s name, other basic demographic information, and the sending <br/>
institution to a richer set of clinical data on the patient. Regardless of the information included, <br/>
these notifications can help ensure that a receiving provider is aware that the patient has received <br/>
care elsewhere. The notification triggers a receiving provider to reach out to the patient and <br/>
deliver appropriate follow-up care in a timely manner. By notifying the physician, care manager, <br/>
or care management team, the notification can help to improve post-discharge transitions and <br/>
reduce the likelihood that a patient would face complications from inadequate follow-up care.  <br/>
In addition to their effectiveness in supporting care coordination, virtually all EHR <br/>
systems generate the basic messages commonly used to support electronic patient event <br/>
notifications. These notifications are based on admission, discharge, and transfer (ADT) <br/>
                                                           <br/>

messages, a standard message used within an EHR as the vehicle for communicating information <br/>
about key changes in a patient’s status as they are tracked by the system (more information about <br/>
the current standard supporting these messages is available at <br/>
<a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=144">http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=144)</a>. As noted in the ISA <br/>
published by ONC, this messaging standard has been widely adopted across the health care <br/>
system (se<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isa/sending-a-notification-a-patients-admission-discharge-andor-transfer-status-other-providers">e https://www.healthit.gov/isa/sending-a-notification-a-patients-admission-discharge-andor-</a><br/>

ADT messages provide each patient’s personal or demographic information (such as the <br/>
patient’s name, insurance, next of kin, and attending physician), when that information has been <br/>
updated, and also indicate when an ADT status has changed. To create an electronic patient <br/>
event notification, a system can use the change in ADT status to trigger a message to a receiving <br/>
provider or to a health information exchange system that can then route the message to the <br/>
appropriate provider. In addition to the basic demographic information contained in the ADT <br/>
message, some patient event notification implementations attach more detailed information to the <br/>
message regarding the patient’s clinical status and care received from the sending provider.   <br/>
B. Proposal for Hospitals (Proposed 42 CFR 482.24(d))   <br/>
We propose to revise the CoPs for Medicare- and Medicaid-participating hospitals at 42 <br/>
CFR 482.24 by adding a new standard at paragraph (d), “Electronic Notifications,” that would <br/>
require hospitals to send electronic patient event notifications of a patient’s admission, discharge, <br/>
and/or transfer to another health care facility or to another community provider. As noted in the <br/>
discussion above, we would require hospitals to convey, at a minimum, the patient’s basic <br/>
personal or demographic information, as well as the name of the sending institution (that is, the <br/>
hospital), and, if not prohibited by other applicable law, diagnosis.  We would also encourage <br/>
hospitals, as their systems and those of the receiving providers allow, to work with patients and <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=146></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>146</b>  <br/>
their practitioners to offer more robust patient information and clinical data upon request in <br/>
accordance with applicable law. <br/>
For a hospital that currently possesses an EHR system with the capacity to generate the <br/>
basic patient personal or demographic information for electronic patient event (ADT) <br/>
notifications, compliance with this proposed standard within the Medical records services CoP <br/>
(42 CFR 482.24) would be determined by the hospital demonstrating that its system:  (1) is fully <br/>
operational and that it operates in accordance with all State and Federal statutes and regulations <br/>
regarding the exchange of patient health information; (2) utilizes the content exchange standard <br/>
incorporated by reference at 45 CFR 170.299(f)(2); (3) sends notifications that must include the <br/>
minimum patient health information (which must be patient name, treating practitioner name, <br/>
sending institution name, and, if not prohibited by other applicable law, patient diagnosis); and <br/>
(4) sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates exchange of health <br/>
information, and at the time of the patient’s admission to the hospital and either immediately <br/>
prior to or at the time of the patient’s discharge and/or transfer from the hospital. We recognize <br/>
that some existing ADT messages might not include diagnosis and therefore seek comment on <br/>
the technical feasibility of including this information as well as the challenges in appropriately <br/>
segmenting this information in instances where the diagnosis may not be permitted for disclosure <br/>
under other applicable laws. <br/>
We propose to limit this requirement to only those hospitals which currently possess <br/>
EHR systems with the technical capacity to generate information for electronic patient event <br/>
notifications as discussed below, recognizing that not all Medicare- and Medicaid-participating <br/>
hospitals have been eligible for past programs promoting adoption of EHR systems. Our goal <br/>
with this proposed requirement is to ensure that hospital EHR systems have a basic capacity to <br/>
generate messages that can be utilized for notifications by a wide range of receiving providers, <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=147></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>147</b>  <br/>
enabled by common standards. We believe that a system that utilizes the ADT messaging <br/>
standard, which is widely used as the basis for implementing these notifications and other similar <br/>
use cases, would meet this goal by supporting the availability of information that can be used to <br/>
generate information for patient event notifications. Specifically, we propose that the system <br/>
utilize the ADT Messaging standard incorporated by reference at 45 CFR 170.299(f)(2).<a href="CMSs.html#147">47</a>  <br/>
While there is no criterion under the ONC Health IT Certification Program which <br/>
certifies health IT to create and send electronic patient event notifications, this standard is <br/>
referenced by other certification criteria under the program. Specifically, this standard supports <br/>
certification criteria related to transferring information to immunization registries, as well as <br/>
transmission of laboratory results to public health agencies as described at 45 CFR 170.315(f) <br/>
under the 2015 Edition certification criteria, and at 45 CFR 170.314(f) under the 2014 Edition. <br/>
Thus, we expect systems that include Health IT Modules certified to meet criteria which <br/>
reference this standard will possess the basic capacity to generate information for notification <br/>
messages. We further note that adopting certified health IT that meets these criteria has been <br/>
required for any hospital seeking to qualify for the Promoting Interoperability Programs <br/>
(formerly the EHR Incentive Programs).  <br/>
We recognize that there is currently significant variation in how hospitals have utilized <br/>
the ADT messages to support implementation of patient event notifications. We also recognize <br/>
that many hospitals, which have already implemented notifications, may be delivering additional <br/>
information beyond the basic information included in the ADT message (both automatically <br/>
when a patient’s status changes and then upon request from receiving providers) to receiving <br/>
practitioners, patient care team members, and post-acute care services providers and suppliers <br/>
                                                           <br/>

with whom they have established patient care relationships and agreements for patient health <br/>
information exchange as allowed by law. We believe consensus standards for ADT-based <br/>
notifications may become more widely adopted in the future (we refer readers to ONC’s ISA<a href="CMSs.html#148">48 </a><br/>
for more information about standards under consideration). However, at this time, we do not <br/>
wish to restrict hospitals from pursuing more advanced content as part of patient notifications, <br/>
nor to create redundant requirements where hospitals already have a suitable notification system <br/>
in place. Accordingly, while we are requiring that hospitals subject to this proposal possess a <br/>
system utilizing this standard, hospitals may utilize other standards or features to support their <br/>
notification systems.  We request comment on this proposal, and whether this requirement would <br/>
achieve the goal of setting a baseline for hospitals’ capacity to generate information for <br/>
electronic notifications, while still allowing for innovative approaches that would potentially <br/>
increase the effectiveness of these notifications toward improving patient outcomes and safety <br/>
during transitions in care. <br/>
We further propose that the hospital would need to demonstrate that the system’s <br/>
notification capacity is fully operational, that it operates in accordance with all state and federal <br/>
statutes and regulations regarding the exchange of patient health information.  We intend for <br/>
these notifications to be required, at minimum, for inpatients admitted to, and discharged and/or <br/>
transferred from the hospital. However, we also note that patient event notifications are an <br/>
effective tool for coordinating care across a wider set of patients that may be cared for by a <br/>
hospital. For instance, a patient event notification could ensure a primary care physician is aware <br/>
that their patient has received care at the emergency room, and initiate outreach to the patient to <br/>
ensure that appropriate follow-up for the emergency visit is pursued. While we encourage <br/>
hospitals to extend the coverage of their notification systems to serve additional patients, outside <br/>
                                                           <br/>

of those admitted and seen as inpatients, we also seek comment on whether we should identify a <br/>
broader set of patients to whom this requirement would apply, and if so, how we should <br/>
implement such a requirement in a way that minimizes administrative burden on hospitals. <br/>
Additionally, we are proposing that the hospital must demonstrate that its system sends <br/>
notifications that must include the minimum patient health information (which must be patient <br/>
name, treating practitioner name, sending institution name, and, if not prohibited by other <br/>
applicable law, patient diagnosis). The hospital would also need to demonstrate that the system <br/>
sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates exchange of health <br/>
information, and at the time of the patient’s admission to the hospital, to licensed and qualified <br/>
practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services providers and suppliers that:  <br/>
(1) receive the notification for treatment, care coordination, or quality improvement purposes; (2) <br/>
have an established care relationship with the patient relevant to his or her care; and (3) for <br/>
whom the hospital has a reasonable certainty of receipt of notifications. Similarly, we are also <br/>
proposing that the hospital would need to demonstrate the transmission of these notifications <br/>
either directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates the exchange of health information, and <br/>
either immediately prior to or at the time of the patient’s discharge or transfer from the hospital, <br/>
to licensed and qualified practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services <br/>
providers and suppliers that:  (1) receive the notification for treatment, care coordination, or <br/>
quality improvement purposes; (2) have an established care relationship with the patient relevant <br/>
to his or her care; and (3) for whom the hospital has a reasonable certainty of receipt of <br/>
notifications. We believe this proposal will allow for a diverse set of strategies that hospitals <br/>
might use when implementing patient event notifications.  <br/>
Through these provisions, we are seeking to allow for different ways that a hospital might <br/>
identify those practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services providers and <br/>

suppliers that are most relevant to both the pre-admission and post-discharge care of a patient. <br/>
We are proposing that hospitals should send notifications to those practitioners or providers that <br/>
have an established care relationship with the patient relevant to his or her care. We recognize <br/>
that hospitals and their partners may identify appropriate recipients through various methods. For <br/>
instance, hospitals might identify appropriate practitioners by requesting this information from <br/>
patients or caregivers upon arrival, or by obtaining information about care team members from <br/>
the patient’s record.  We expect hospitals might develop or optimize processes to capture <br/>
information about established care relationships directly, or work with an intermediary that <br/>
maintains information about care relationships. In other cases, hospitals may, directly or through <br/>
an intermediary, identify appropriate notification recipients through the analysis of care patterns <br/>
or other attribution methods that seek to determine the provider most likely to be able to <br/>
effectively coordinate care post-discharge for a specific patient. The hospital or intermediary <br/>
might also develop processes to allow a provider to specifically request notifications for a given <br/>
patient for whom they are responsible for care coordination as confirmed through conversations <br/>
with the patient.  <br/>
Additionally, we would expect hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs to comply with <br/>
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rules set out at 45 CFR <br/>
Parts 160 and 164 when these proposed CoP requirements for patient event notifications are <br/>
finalized. As required at 42 CFR 482.11 for hospitals and psychiatric hospitals and at 42 CFR <br/>
485.608 for CAHs, these providers must comply with all pertinent currently existing federal <br/>
laws, including the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The patient event notifications and other exchanges of <br/>
patient information would be permitted as disclosures for treatment purposes under 45 CFR part <br/>
164.   <br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>151</b>  <br/>
We also recognize that factors outside of the hospital’s control may determine whether or <br/>
not a notification is successfully received and utilized by a practitioner. Accordingly, we have <br/>
proposed that a hospital would only need to send notifications to those practitioners for whom <br/>
the hospital has reasonable certainty of receipt. While we expect hospitals will, to the best of <br/>
their ability, seek to ensure that notification recipients are able to receive notifications (for <br/>
instance, by obtaining a recipient’s Direct address), we understand that technical issues beyond <br/>
the hospital’s control may prevent successful receipt and use of a notification. <br/>
Finally, we note that hospitals have an existing responsibility under the CoPs at 42 CFR <br/>
482.43(d) to “transfer or refer patients, along with necessary medical information, to appropriate <br/>
facilities, agencies, or outpatient services, as needed, for follow-up or ancillary care.” We wish to <br/>
emphasize that our proposal regarding patient event notifications would be separate from the <br/>
requirement regarding necessary medical information at 42 CFR 482.43(d). We recognize that <br/>
processes to implement this proposal, if finalized, may intersect with the hospital’s discharge <br/>
planning process. We note that nothing in this proposal would affect the hospital’s <br/>
responsibilities under 42 CFR 482.43(d). However, if this proposal is finalized, hospitals may <br/>
wish to consider ways to fulfill these requirements in ways that reduce redundancy while still <br/>
remaining compliant with existing requirements. For instance, where appropriate and allowed by <br/>
law, hospitals may seek to include required necessary medical information within the same <br/>
message as a patient event notification. <br/>
As previously stated, we are committed to continuing to identify further steps we can take <br/>
to ensure that facilities that are electronically capturing information are exchanging that <br/>
information electronically with providers that have the capacity to accept it. We expect that this <br/>
will be required through rulemaking at a future point in time with one option being alignment <br/>
with the TEFCA described in the Cures Act. <br/>

C. Proposal for Psychiatric Hospitals (Proposed 42 CFR 482.61(f)) <br/>
Medicare- and Medicaid-participating psychiatric hospitals must comply with all of the <br/>
hospital CoPs at 42 CFR 482.1 through 482.23 and at 42 CFR 482.25 through 482.57. They also <br/>
must adhere to special provisions regarding medical records at 42 CFR 482.61 and staffing <br/>
requirements at 42 CFR 482.62. Since the medical records requirements are different for <br/>
psychiatric hospitals, and since these hospitals do not have to comply with our regulations at 42 <br/>
CFR 482.24, we are proposing a new electronic notification standard at 42 CFR 482.61(f) within <br/>
the special provisions for psychiatric hospitals in this section.  <br/>
Similar to our proposal for hospitals at 42 CFR 482.24(d), we are proposing a new <br/>
standard at 42 CFR 482.61(f), “Electronic Notifications,” that would require psychiatric hospitals <br/>
to send electronic patient event notifications of a patient’s admission, discharge, and/or transfer <br/>
to another health care facility or to another community provider. <br/>
As we have proposed for hospitals, we propose to limit this requirement to only those <br/>
psychiatric hospitals which currently possess EHR systems with the technical capacity to <br/>
generate information for electronic patient event notifications, defined as systems that utilize the <br/>
content exchange standard incorporated by reference at 45 CFR 170.299(f)(2). We propose that <br/>
that for a psychiatric hospital that currently possesses an EHR system with the capacity to <br/>
generate the basic patient personal or demographic information for electronic patient event <br/>
(ADT) notifications, compliance with this proposed standard within the Special medical records <br/>
requirements for psychiatric hospitals CoP (42 CFR 482.61) would be determined by the hospital <br/>
demonstrating that its system:  (1) is fully operational and that it operates in accordance with all <br/>
State and Federal statutes and regulations regarding the exchange of patient health information; <br/>
(2) utilizes the content exchange standard incorporated by reference at 45 CFR 170.299(f)(2); (3) <br/>
sends notifications that must include the minimum patient health information (which must be <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=153></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>153</b>  <br/>
patient name, treating practitioner name, sending institution name, and, if not prohibited by other <br/>
applicable law, patient diagnosis) ;  and (4) sends notifications directly, or through an <br/>
intermediary that facilitates exchange of health information, and at the time of the patient’s <br/>
admission to the hospital and either immediately prior to or at the time of the patient’s discharge <br/>
and/or transfer from the hospital.  Please note that we are requesting comment on this policy as <br/>
part of this hospital proposal in section X.B. of this proposed rule above. Please see additional <br/>
discussion in the proposal for hospitals above. <br/>
Additionally, we are proposing that the hospital would need to demonstrate that the system <br/>
sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates exchange of health <br/>
information, and at the time of the patient’s admission to the hospital, to licensed and qualified <br/>
practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services providers and suppliers that:  <br/>
(1) receive the notification for treatment, care coordination, or quality improvement purposes; (2) <br/>
have an established care relationship with the patient relevant to his or her care; and (3) for <br/>
whom the hospital has a reasonable certainty of receipt of notifications. Similarly, we are also <br/>
proposing that the hospital would need to demonstrate the transmission of these notifications <br/>
either directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates the exchange of health information, and <br/>
either immediately prior to or at the time of the patient’s discharge or transfer from the hospital, <br/>
to licensed and qualified practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services <br/>
providers and suppliers that:  (1) receive the notification for treatment, care coordination, or <br/>
quality improvement purposes; (2) have an established care relationship with the patient relevant <br/>
to his or her care; and (3) for whom the hospital has a reasonable certainty of receipt of <br/>
notifications.  <br/>
We refer readers to the extended discussion of these proposals in sections X.A. and B. of <br/>
this proposed rule. We seek comment on these proposals. <br/>

<b>154</b>  <br/>
D. Proposal for CAHs <br/>
We believe implementation of patient event notifications are also important for CAHs to <br/>
support improved care coordination from these facilities to other providers in their communities. <br/>
Therefore, similar to our proposals for the hospital and psychiatric hospital medical records <br/>
requirements as discussed in the preceding sections, we would revise 42 CFR 485.638, by adding <br/>
a new standard to the CAH Clinical records CoP at paragraph (d), “Electronic Notifications.” <br/>
This proposed standard would require CAHs to send electronic patient event notifications of a <br/>
patient’s admission, discharge, and/or transfer to another health care facility or to another <br/>
community provider.  <br/>
We propose to limit this requirement to only those CAHs which currently possess EHR <br/>
systems with the technical capacity to generate information for electronic patient event <br/>
notifications, defined as systems that utilize the content exchange standard incorporated by <br/>
reference at 45 CFR 170.299(f)(2). We propose that for a CAH that currently possesses an EHR <br/>
system with the capacity to generate the basic patient personal or demographic information for <br/>
electronic patient event (ADT) notifications, compliance with this proposed standard within the <br/>
Clinical records services CoP (42 CFR 485.638) would be determined by the CAH <br/>
demonstrating that its system:  (1) is fully operational and that it operates in accordance with all <br/>
State and Federal statutes and regulations regarding the exchange of patient health information; <br/>
(2) utilizes the content exchange standard incorporated by reference at 45 CFR 170.299(f)(2); (3) <br/>
sends notifications that must include the minimum patient health information (which must be <br/>
patient name, treating practitioner name, sending institution name, and, if not prohibited by other <br/>
applicable law, patient diagnosis); and (4) sends notifications directly, or through an <br/>
intermediary that facilitates exchange of health information, and at the time of the patient’s <br/>
admission to the CAH and either immediately prior to or at the time of the patient’s discharge <br/>
<hr/>

and/or transfer from the CAH. Please note that we are requesting comment on this policy as part <br/>
of the hospital proposal above in section X.B. of this proposed rule. Please see additional <br/>
discussion in the proposal for hospitals above.  <br/>
Additionally, we are proposing that the CAH would need to demonstrate that the system <br/>
sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates exchange of health <br/>
information, and at the time of the patient’s admission to the CAH, to licensed and qualified <br/>
practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services providers and suppliers that:  <br/>
(1) receive the notification for treatment, care coordination, or quality improvement purposes; (2) <br/>
have an established care relationship with the patient relevant to his or her care; and (3) for <br/>
whom the CAH has a reasonable certainty of receipt of notifications. Similarly, we are also <br/>
proposing that the CAH would need to demonstrate the transmission of these notifications either <br/>
directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates the exchange of health information, and either <br/>
immediately prior to or at the time of the patient’s discharge or transfer from the CAH, to <br/>
licensed and qualified practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services <br/>
providers and suppliers that:  (1) receive the notification for treatment, care coordination, or <br/>
quality improvement purposes; (2) have an established care relationship with the patient relevant <br/>
to his or her care; and (3) for whom the CAH has a reasonable certainty of receipt of <br/>
notifications.  <br/>
We request comments on all of these proposals. We are especially interested in <br/>
stakeholder feedback about how these proposals should be operationalized. Additionally, we <br/>
seek comment on how CMS should implement these proposals as part of survey and certification <br/>
guidance in a manner that minimizes compliance burden on hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and <br/>
CAHs while ensuring adherence with the standards. We are also interested in stakeholder input <br/>

<b>XI. Request for Information on Advancing Interoperability Across the Care Continuum </b><br/>
A. Background <br/>
Transitions across care settings have been characterized as common, complicated, costly, <br/>
and potentially hazardous for individuals with complex health needs. Yet despite the need for <br/>
functionality to support better care coordination, discharge planning, and timely transfer of <br/>
essential health information, interoperability by certain health care providers such as long term <br/>
and PAC, behavioral health, and home and community-based services continues to lag behind <br/>
acute care providers. Research from the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) <br/>
and CMS, showed that in 2014, 44 percent of patients discharged from an acute care <br/>
hospitalization received post-acute services, such as an admission to a SNFs, an IRF or a LTCH, <br/>
or received HHA services. Specifically, of the 1,260,958 patients that received post-acute <br/>
services following an acute care hospitalization, “…47.8 percent were discharged to a HHA, <br/>
42.1 percent to a SNF, 8.4 percent to an IRF, 1.0 percent to a LTCH and .7 percent to LTCH-Site <br/>
Neutral.”<a href="CMSs.html#156">49 </a>In addition to the frequency of patients discharged from acute care to PAC, a <br/>
remarkable number of patients discharged from PAC services receive subsequent care by another <br/>
PAC provider. For instance, while more current analysis is being finalized, we note that 2012 <br/>
data from the Post-Acute Care Reform Demonstration (PAC PRD) found, “67 percent of those <br/>
discharged to SNFs continued on to additional services. Almost a quarter of them were <br/>
readmitted to the acute hospital (23.1 percent). Another third (32.7 percent) were discharged <br/>
from the SNF to a HHA.  <br/>
                                                           <br/>

<hr/>
<a name=157></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>157</b>  <br/>
In patients with the Acute-SNF-HHA pattern, almost 20 percent (19.9 percent) returned <br/>
to the acute care hospital within 30 days of discharge from the HHA. Hospital patients <br/>
discharged to LTCHs and IRFs were also likely to use multiple types of PAC services and a <br/>
substantial share of these cases were readmitted within 30 days of discharge, ranging from 15.9 <br/>
percent (LTCH-to-IRF cases) to 42.8 percent (LTCH to SNF cases).”<a href="CMSs.html#157">50</a> In examining the home <br/>
health patterns, it is important to keep in mind that a significant number of the home health <br/>
population does not come through an acute admission or as part of a post-acute trajectory of care <br/>
but instead are directly admitted to the HHA from the community. The percentages of PAC use <br/>
and patterns of multiple transitions reinforce the need for safeguards around transitions of care. <br/>
These findings also speak to the importance of the interoperable exchange of information <br/>
necessary to ensure continuity of care, and mitigate the risks of unintended events, such as those <br/>
associated with medication errors, that can result from inadequate and untimely exchange of <br/>
information.  <br/>
Poor patient outcomes, resulting from poor communication and lack of information, have <br/>
been found to contribute to hospital readmissions, emergency department (ED) visits, and <br/>
adverse outcomes. A well-documented contributor to this problem is incomplete and missing <br/>
information for patients with frequent transitions across care settings. While interoperable, <br/>
bidirectional exchange of essential health information can improve these transitions, many long-<br/>
term and PAC, behavioral health, and home and community-based service providers have not <br/>
adopted health IT at the same rate as acute care hospitals. One major contributing factor to this <br/>
difference in adoption rates can be attributed to the fact that PAC providers were not eligible for <br/>
                                                           <br/>

the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs (now known as the Promoting <br/>
Interoperability Programs), which slowed adoption of EHRs and other forms of interoperable <br/>
health IT for these providers. <br/>
National data on EHR adoption and interoperability by these providers is limited. For <br/>
PAC facilities that do possess EHRs, vendor adoption of interoperable functionality has been <br/>
slow and uneven. A national survey of SNFs found that 64 percent of facilities used an EHR in <br/>
2016, 29 percent of SNFs could send or receive health information, but only 7 percent could <br/>
send, find, receive, and integrate such information.<a href="CMSs.html#158">51 </a>According to the 2015 National Electronic <br/>
Health Records Survey (NEHRS), 61.3 percent of psychiatrists were using an EHR, of which <br/>
40.8 percent were certified systems.<a href="CMSs.html#158">52 </a>A CDC survey found that 26 percent of residential care <br/>
communities used EHRs in 2016.<a href="CMSs.html#158">53 </a><br/>
B. Solicitation of Comments  <br/>
We are soliciting comment on several potential strategies for advancing interoperability <br/>
across care settings to inform future rulemaking activity in this area.  <br/>
As discussed above, health IT adoption has lagged in care settings that were not part of <br/>
the EHR Incentive Programs. We are seeking input on how HHS can more broadly incentivize <br/>
the adoption of interoperable health IT systems and use of interoperable data across settings such <br/>
as long-term and PAC, behavioral health, and those settings serving individuals who are dually <br/>
eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and/or receiving home and community-based services. We <br/>

invite comment on specific policy strategies HHS could adopt to deliver financial support for <br/>
technology adoption and use in these settings. <br/>
We also recognize that an ongoing challenge to advancing and incentivizing <br/>
interoperability is the lack of agreed-upon measure concepts with which to gauge how well <br/>
providers are routinely and effectively engaging in exchange of information across settings. To <br/>
date, the measurement of interoperability has largely focused on the use of certified technology <br/>
and the percentage of information exchanged. Expanding the scope of interoperability <br/>
measurement beyond settings that were eligible for the EHR Incentive Programs is critical as <br/>
efforts are being made to enable health IT and exchange capabilities across a broader range of <br/>
care settings. In light of the interest by the stakeholder community to enable interoperability <br/>
across all providers, HHS is seeking public comment on measure concepts that assess <br/>
interoperability, including measure concepts that address PAC, behavioral health, home and <br/>
community-based services, and other provider settings.  <br/>
A National Quality Forum report on <i>Quality in Home and Community-Based Services to </i><br/>
<i>Support Community Living: Addressing Gaps in Performance Measurement</i> suggested that new <br/>
types of measure concepts that assess quality across the continuum of care are needed. <br/>
Specifically, NQF cited the domain of “service delivery and effectiveness,” which encompasses <br/>
the level to which individuals who use Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) receive <br/>
services and supports sufficient to meet their needs, as well as the domain of “person-centered <br/>
planning and coordination,” which includes a focus on the level to which services and supports <br/>
across the health and social service systems are coordinated for individuals who receive HCBS. <br/>
We seek comment on needed measure development work and quality improvement efforts <br/>
focused on assuring individuals receive sufficient needed services across the care continuum and <br/>

that their services are coordinated.<a href="CMSs.html#160">54</a> We are also interested in comments on the applicability and <br/>
feasibility of measure concepts for PAC, behavioral health, home and community-based services <br/>
as identified in previous ASPE reports<a href="CMSs.html#160">55,56</a> and the report, <i>A Measurement Framework to Assess </i><br/>
<i>Nationwide Progress Related to Interoperable Health Information Exchange to Support the </i><br/>
<i>National Quality Strategy,</i> published by the National Quality Forum.<a href="CMSs.html#160">57</a> <br/>
As part of its work under the IMPACT Act, which requires, in part, that certain patient <br/>
assessment data be standardized and interoperable to allow for exchange of the data among PAC <br/>
providers and other providers, CMS has defined certain standardized patient assessment data <br/>
elements<a href="CMSs.html#160">58</a> and their associated health IT vocabularies across PAC settings. Implementation of <br/>
these standardized data elements is designed to support more seamless and effective assessment <br/>
of quality across PAC settings, while also presenting a significant improvement in the ability of <br/>
these settings to potentially share structured electronic data with other providers across the care <br/>
continuum.  <br/>

To enable the bidirectional exchange of this health information, we are seeking public <br/>
comment on whether hospitals and physicians should adopt the capability to collect and <br/>
electronically exchange a subset of the same PAC standardized patient assessment data elements <br/>
(for example, functional status, pressure ulcers/injuries) in their EHRs. As these health care <br/>
providers have generally been eligible for the EHR Incentive Programs (now known as <br/>
Promoting Interoperability Programs), many of them would have adopted certified EHR <br/>
technology and health IT systems, which are required to capture and exchange certain data <br/>
elements under the ONC Health IT certification program. The set of data which systems must <br/>
include under the certification program is set to expand in coming years under the USCDI <br/>
Version 1 ONC has proposed for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.213, which would establish a <br/>
minimum set of data classes that would be required to be interoperable nationwide. (See the <br/>
ONC proposed rule published elsewhere in this <b>Federal Register</b>) The USCDI is designed to be <br/>
expanded in an iterative and predictable way over time.   <br/>
We are seeking comment on whether to move toward the adoption of PAC standardized <br/>
data elements through the expansion of the USCDI process. We are interested in whether the <br/>
standardized patient assessment data elements that are implemented in CMS PAC assessment <br/>
instruments in satisfaction of the IMPACT Act would be appropriate. If the full set of such <br/>
standardized patient assessment data elements is not appropriate, we are seeking comment on <br/>
whether a subset of these standardized items would be appropriate, and input on which data <br/>
elements should be prioritized as part of a subset. We are also seeking information on what <br/>
implementation timeline would be most appropriate for requiring adoption of these data elements <br/>
in provider and hospital systems under the ONC Health IT Certification Program. We are also <br/>
seeking comment on the administrative, development, and implementation burden that may be <br/>
associated with adopting these data elements.  <br/>

<b>XII. Advancing Interoperability in Innovative Models  </b><br/>
A.  Promoting Interoperability <br/>
CMS plans to utilize Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (&#34;Innovation Center&#34;) <br/>
authority under section 1115A of the Act to test ways to promote interoperability across the <br/>
health care spectrum. Section 1115A of the Act authorizes the Innovation Center to test <br/>
innovative payment and service delivery models expected to reduce program expenditures, while <br/>
preserving or enhancing the quality of care furnished to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries <br/>
and CHIP enrollees. Interoperability and health data sharing are critical to the success of new <br/>
payment and service delivery models that incentivize high quality, efficient care.     <br/>
Innovation Center models can include multiple types of health care providers and other <br/>
entities such as physician group practices, hospitals, PAC facilities, community-based <br/>
organizations providing community-based long-term care services and supports or non-medical <br/>
services, and dialysis centers.  These types of health care providers furnish care to patients in <br/>
different care settings, have different health IT systems, and have varied levels of experience <br/>
with, and access to, EHR technology. The historically disparate and inadequate use of health IT <br/>
among these providers and other entities has posed challenges to interoperability. Additionally, <br/>
many of these types of health care providers are not eligible for the Promoting Interoperability <br/>
Programs (previously known as the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs) and the <br/>
associated financial incentives for EHR adoption and meaningful use. <br/>
We believe Innovation Center models <a href="https://innovation.cms.gov/">(https://innovation.cms.gov/)</a> provide an important <br/>
lever to advance progress toward interoperability. These models offer unique opportunities to <br/>
engage with health care providers and other entities in innovative ways and to test concepts that <br/>
have the ability to accelerate change in the U.S. health care system, including to promote <br/>
interoperability.  One example of CMS’s use of Innovation Center Models to promote <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=163></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>163</b>  <br/>
interoperability is found in the Innovation Center’s State Innovation Models (SIM) initiative <br/>
<a href="https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/state-innovations/">(https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/state-innovations/)</a>, under which several awards to states <br/>
are focused on health information exchanges and health IT investment.  Another example of this <br/>
work is found in the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) model <br/>
<a href="https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/comprehensive-primary-care-plus">(https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/comprehensive-primary-care-plus)</a>, in which primary care <br/>
practices use health IT to strengthen their ability to deliver care, with some practices partnering <br/>
with health IT vendors to implement advanced health IT functionality in their practices, <br/>
including functionality that promotes interoperability and sharing of electronic health <br/>
information.  <br/>
B. Examples of Interoperability-Related Areas of Focus for New Model Development <br/>
Examples of how we may focus on interoperability related-issues in future model <br/>
development may include: models that incorporate piloting emerging standards; models <br/>
leveraging non-traditional data in model design (for example, data from schools, data regarding <br/>
housing and data on food insecurity); and models leveraging technology-enabled patient <br/>
engagement platforms. The Innovation Center has incorporated non-clinical data in prior models, <br/>
but anticipates addressing additional uses and types of non-clinical data in future models.  <br/>
We are now requesting public comment on the following general principles around <br/>
interoperability within Innovation Center models for integration into new models, through <br/>
provisions in model participation agreements or other governing documents. In applying these <br/>
general principles, we intend to be sensitive to the details of individual model design, and the <br/>
characteristics and capacities of the participants in each specific model. <br/>
C. Establishing Principles for Promoting Interoperability in Innovative Model Tests <br/>
1.  Provide Patients Access to their Own Electronic Health Information <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=164></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>164</b>  <br/>
The MyHealthEData and Medicare Blue Button 2.0 initiatives aim to empower patients <br/>
by ensuring that they have access to their health care data and can decide how their data is going <br/>
to be used, all while keeping their data safe and secure. Certain Innovation Center models <br/>
already require that participants with direct patient interactions provide their patients with <br/>
electronic access to their health information within 24 hours of any encounter. New Innovation <br/>
Center models may also require that providers and other health care entities with direct patient <br/>
interactions provide patients access to their own electronic health information and, upon the <br/>
patient’s authorization, to third party developers via APIs. <br/>
2.  Promote Trusted Health Information Exchange <br/>
Innovation Center model participants may, where appropriate, be required to participate <br/>
in a trusted exchange network that meets the following criteria:   <br/>
●  The trusted exchange network must be able to exchange PHI in compliance with all <br/>
applicable state and federal laws across jurisdictions.  <br/>
●  The trusted exchange network must connect both inpatient EHRs and ambulatory <br/>
EHRs.  <br/>
●  The trusted exchange network must support secure messaging or electronic querying <br/>
by and between patients, providers and payers.   <br/>
Additionally, model participants may be required to participate in electronic alerting via <br/>
one of the standards described in the ISA, II-A: Admission, Discharge, and Transfer published <br/>
and updated by ONC. <br/>
3.  Adopt Leading Health IT Standards and Pilot Emerging Standards  <br/>
Emerging health data standards present new opportunities to exchange more types of <br/>
health care data between health care providers. Innovation Center model participants, along with <br/>
their health IT vendors, may pilot new FHIR standards and advance adoption of new data classes <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=165></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>165</b>  <br/>
in USCDI (for example, psychosocial data) to improve interoperability for care management, <br/>
quality reporting or other priority use cases. As part of the design and testing of innovative <br/>
payment and service delivery models, the Innovation Center anticipates taking on a leadership <br/>
role in developing new or less mature FHIR and supporting more innovative interventions <br/>
undertaken by states, whenever possible. <br/>
D. Request for Stakeholder Input <br/>
 <br/>
The Innovation Center seeks public comment on the principles for promoting <br/>
interoperability in innovative payment and service delivery models described above. <br/>
Additionally, the Innovation Center is requesting public comment on other ways in which the <br/>
Innovation Center may further promote interoperability among model participants and other <br/>
health care providers as part of the design and testing of innovative payment and service delivery <br/>
models. <br/>
<b>XIII. Request for Information on Policies to Improve Patient Matching </b><br/>
A. Background <br/>
Through stakeholder feedback such as roundtables, stakeholder meetings, and <br/>
rulemaking, we have received considerable feedback that the lack of a UPI inhibits <br/>
interoperability efforts because, without a unique identifier for each patient, the safe and secure <br/>
electronic exchange of health information is constrained as it is difficult to ensure that the <br/>
relevant records are all for the same patient. HIPAA required the adoption of a “unique <br/>
individual identifier for healthcare purposes,” commonly referred to as a UPI. At the time <br/>
HIPAA was enacted, HHS began to consider what information would be needed to develop a <br/>
rule to adopt a UPI standard. An initial Notice of Intent to issue a proposed rule on requirements <br/>
for a unique health identifier for individuals was published in the November 2, 1998 <b>Federal </b><br/>
<b>Register</b> (63 FR 61773 through 61774).  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=166></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>166</b>  <br/>
Appreciating the significant privacy and security concerns raised by stakeholders <br/>
regarding implementing a UPI, Congress included language in the Omnibus Consolidated and <br/>
Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277, enacted October 21, <br/>
1998) and in each subsequent Appropriations bill, stating none of the funds made available in <br/>
this Act may be used to promulgate or adopt any final standard under section 1173(b) of the Act <br/>
(42 U.S.C. 1320d–2(b)) providing for, or providing for the assignment of, a unique health <br/>
identifier for an individual (except in an individual’s capacity as an employer or a health care <br/>
provider), until legislation is enacted specifically approving the standard. This language has <br/>
effectively prohibited HHS from engaging in rulemaking to adopt a UPI standard. Consequently, <br/>
the Secretary withdrew the Notice of Intent to pursue rulemaking on this issue on August 9, 2000 <br/>
<a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=200010&RIN=0938-AI91">(https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=200010&amp;RIN=0938-AI91).</a> <br/>
Although the appropriations language regarding the UPI standard has remained <br/>
unchanged, in the report accompanying the 2017 appropriations bill, Congress additionally <br/>
stated, although the Committee continues to carry a prohibition against HHS using funds to <br/>
promulgate or adopt any final standard providing for the assignment of a unique health identifier <br/>
for an individual until such activity is authorized, the Committee notes that this limitation does <br/>
not prohibit HHS from examining the issues around patient matching. Accordingly, the <br/>
Committee encouraged the Secretary, acting through ONC and CMS, to provide technical <br/>
assistance to private-sector led initiatives to develop a coordinated national strategy that will <br/>
promote patient safety by accurately identifying patients to their health information. (H.R. Rep. <br/>
No. 114–<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114hrpt699/pdf/CRPT-114hrpt699.pdf">699, p. 110, https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114hrpt699/pdf/CRPT-</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114hrpt699/pdf/CRPT-114hrpt699.pdf">114hrpt699.pdf)</a>. Congress has repeated this guidance for 2018 and 2019. This guidance directed <br/>
HHS to focus on examining issues around patient matching and to provide technical assistance to <br/>
private sector-led initiatives focusing on a patient matching solution.  <br/>

<a name=167></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>167</b>  <br/>
In conjunction with ONC, we are posing a request for information regarding how CMS <br/>
could leverage our program authority to improve patient identification to facilitate improved <br/>
patient safety, enable better care coordination, and advance interoperability. Inaccurate patient <br/>
matching can lead to adverse events, compromised safety and privacy, inappropriate and <br/>
unnecessary care, increased health care costs, and poor oversight of fraud and abuse. We <br/>
consider this a quality of care and patient safety issue and seek stakeholder input on ways we can <br/>
incent improvements.  <br/>
In section 4007 of the 21st Century Cures Act, the Government Accountability Office <br/>
(GAO) was directed to conduct a study to determine whether ONC and other stakeholders could <br/>
improve patient matching through various mechanisms, to survey ongoing efforts related to the <br/>
policies and activities and the effectiveness of such efforts occurring in the private sector, and to <br/>
evaluate current methods used in certified EHRs for patient matching. The GAO was also tasked <br/>
with submitting to Congress a report concerning the findings of the study. This report was <br/>
released in January 2019.<a href="CMSs.html#167">59</a> <br/>
In section I of this proposed rule, we discuss further how patient identification and <br/>
matching pose challenges to interoperability. We look forward to working with ONC as we <br/>
review the responses to this RFI in concert with the GAO report to help inform potential <br/>
appropriate methods to scale best practices and leverage program authority to improve patient <br/>
matching.  <br/>
B. Solicitation of Comments  <br/>
We are soliciting comment on potential strategies to address patient matching. Many <br/>
stakeholders commenting on the interoperability RFIs included in the various 2019 proposed <br/>
payment rules, including the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule (83 FR 20550), indicated that patient <br/>
                                                           <br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>168</b>  <br/>
matching is a “core functionality” of patient identification and necessary to ensure care <br/>
coordination and the best patient outcomes. Commenters also noted that a consistently used <br/>
matching strategy could accomplish the original goals of a UPI with a diminished risk to <br/>
individual privacy and health information security. We solicit comment on how and in what way <br/>
patient matching does or does not present the same security and privacy risks as a UPI. <br/>
We understand the significant health information privacy and security concerns raised <br/>
around the development of a UPI standard and the current prohibition against using HHS funds <br/>
to adopt a UPI standard. Recognizing Congress’ statement regarding patient matching and <br/>
stakeholder comments stating that a patient matching solution would accomplish the goals of a <br/>
UPI, we seek comment on ways for us to continue to facilitate private sector work on a workable <br/>
and scalable patient matching strategy so that the lack of a specific UPI does not impede the free <br/>
flow of information for future consideration. <br/>
We are also seeking comment on how we may leverage our program authority to provide <br/>
support to those working to improve patient matching. We specifically seek input on the <br/>
following questions and the potential authority for the requirement:  <br/>
1.  Should CMS require Medicare FFS, MA Plans, Medicaid FFS, Medicaid managed <br/>
care plans (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs), CHIP FFS, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP <br/>
issuers in FFEs (not including SADP issuers), use a patient matching algorithm with a proven <br/>
success rate of a certain percentage where the algorithm and real world processes associated with <br/>
the algorithm used are validated by HHS or a 3rd party?  <br/>
2.  Should CMS require Medicare FFS, the MA Plans, Medicaid FFS, Medicaid managed <br/>
care plans, CHIP FFS, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs to use a particular <br/>
patient matching software solution with a proven success rate of a certain percentage validated <br/>
by HHS or a 3rd party?  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=169></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>169</b>  <br/>
3.  Should CMS expand the recent Medicare ID card efforts by requiring a CMS-wide <br/>
identifier which is used for all beneficiaries and enrollees in health care programs under CMS <br/>
administration and authority, specifically by requiring any or all of the following: <br/>
●  That MA organizations, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors, entities offering cost <br/>
plans under section 1876 of the Act, and other Medicare health plans use the Medicare ID in <br/>
their plan administration. <br/>
●  That State Medicaid and CHIP agencies in their FFS or managed care programs use <br/>
the Medicare ID for dual eligible individuals when feasible. <br/>
●  That QHP issuers in FFEs use the Medicare ID for their enrollees in the administration <br/>
of their plans.   <br/>
4.  Should CMS advance more standardized data elements across all appropriate <br/>
programs for matching purposes, perhaps leveraging the USCDI proposed by ONC for HHS <br/>
adoption at 45 CFR 170.213.  <br/>
5.  Should CMS complement CMS data and plan data in Medicaid managed care plans <br/>
(MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs), CHIP managed care entities, MA Plans, and QHP issuers in an <br/>
FFE (not including SADP issuers) with one or more verifying data sources for identity proofing? <br/>
What potential data source should be considered? What are possible restrictions or limitations to <br/>
accessing such information? <br/>
6.  Should CMS support connecting EHRs to other complementary verifying data sources <br/>
for identity proofing? What potential data source should be considered? What are possible <br/>
restrictions or limitations to accessing such information? <br/>
7. To what extent should patient-generated data complement the patient-matching <br/>
efforts?  <br/>
 <br/>

<b>XIV.  Collection of Information Requirements </b><br/>
 <br/>
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, we are required to provide 60-day notice in <br/>
the <b>Federal Register</b> and solicit public comment before a collection of information requirement <br/>
is submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval.  In order <br/>
to fairly evaluate whether an information collection should be approved by OMB, section <br/>
3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires that we solicit comment on the <br/>
following issues: <br/>
●  The need for the information collection and its usefulness in carrying out the proper <br/>
functions of our agency. <br/>
●  The accuracy of our estimate of the information collection burden. <br/>
●  The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected.  <br/>
●  Recommendations to minimize the information collection burden on the affected <br/>
public, including automated collection techniques. <br/>
We are soliciting public comment on each of these issues for the following sections of <br/>
this document that contain information collection requirements (ICRs): <br/>
A.  Background <br/>
Health plans should have the ability to exchange data instantly with other payers for care <br/>
and payment coordination or transitions, and with providers to facilitate more efficient care. <br/>
Health plans are in a unique position to provide enrollees a complete picture of their claims and <br/>
encounter data, allowing patients to piece together their own information that might otherwise be <br/>
lost in disparate systems. To advance our commitment to interoperability, we are proposing new <br/>
requirements to implement APIs for MA organizations at 42 CFR 422.119, Medicaid FFS at 42 <br/>
CFR 431.60, CHIP FFS at 42 CFR 457.730, Medicaid managed care at 42 CFR 438.242, CHIP <br/>
managed care at 42 CFR 457.1233(d), and QHP issuers in FFEs, excluding SADPs at 45 CFR <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=171></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>171</b>  <br/>
156.221. These openly published APIs will permit third-party applications to retrieve <br/>
standardized data for adjudicated claims, encounters with capitated and subcapitated providers, <br/>
provider remittances, beneficiary cost-sharing, reports of lab test results (depending on whether <br/>
the plan manages such data), provider directories, and, as applicable, preferred drug lists. We <br/>
believe that these proposals are designed to empower patients by making sure that they can <br/>
access their healthcare data, through the use of common technologies, without special effort and <br/>
in an easily usable digital format.  We also expect our API proposals to enable the enrollees in <br/>
the plans that are subject to our proposal to share their healthcare data. By making claims data <br/>
readily available and portable to the patient, these initiatives support moving our healthcare <br/>
system away from a FFS payment system that pays for volume and toward a payment system <br/>
that pays for value and quality by reducing duplication of services; adding efficiency to provider <br/>
visits; and, facilitating identification of fraud, waste, and abuse.   <br/>
B. Wage Estimates <br/>
To derive average costs, we used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May <br/>
2017 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates for Direct Health and Medical <br/>
Insurance Carriers (NAICS 524114)<a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics5_524114.htm"> (https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics5_524114.htm).</a> <br/>

As indicated, we are adjusting our employee hourly wage estimates by a factor of 100 <br/>
percent. This is necessarily a rough adjustment, both because fringe benefits and overhead costs <br/>
vary significantly from employer to employer, and because methods of estimating these costs <br/>
vary widely from study to study. Nonetheless, there is no practical alternative and we believe <br/>
that doubling the hourly wage to estimate total cost is a reasonable accurate estimation method.  <br/>
C. Information Collection Requirements (ICRs)  <br/>
1. ICRs Regarding MMA File Requirements (42 CFR 423.910) <br/>
States submit data on files at least monthly to CMS to identify all dually eligible <br/>
individuals, including full-benefit and partial-benefit dually eligible beneficiaries (that is, those <br/>
who get Medicaid help with Medicare premiums, and often for cost-sharing). The file is called <br/>
the MMA file, but is occasionally referred to as the “State Phasedown file.” Section 423.910(d) <br/>
requires states to submit at least one MMA file each month.  However, states have the option to <br/>
submit multiple MMA files throughout the month (up to one per day). Most states submit at least <br/>
weekly.  This information collection activity is currently approved under OMB control number <br/>
0938-0958. <br/>
Ensuring information on dual eligibility status is accurate and up-to-date by increasing <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=173></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>173</b>  <br/>
the frequency of federal-state data exchange is an important step toward interoperability. As a <br/>
result, we are proposing to update the frequency requirements in 42 CFR 423.910(d) to require <br/>
that starting April 1, 2022, all states submit the required MMA file data to CMS daily, and to <br/>
make conforming edits to 42 CFR 423.910(b)(1). Daily would mean every business day, but that <br/>
if no new transactions are available to transmit, data would not need to be submitted on a given <br/>
business day. We estimate it would take a computer systems analyst about 6 months <br/>
(approximately 960 hours) to complete the systems updates necessary to process and submit the <br/>
MMA data daily. As only 13 states currently submit MMA data daily, we estimate a one-time <br/>
burden for 37 states and the District of Columbia complying with submission of daily MMA data <br/>
at $3,034,406 (38 states (and DC) x 960 hours x $83.18 per hour for a computer system analyst). <br/>
We will be revising the information collection request currently approved under 0938-0958 to <br/>
include the requirements discussed in this section.  <br/>
2. ICRs Regarding API Proposals (42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, and 438.242, and 45 CFR 156.221) <br/>
To promote our commitment to interoperability, we are proposing new requirements for <br/>
APIs for MA organizations at 42 CFR 422.119, Medicaid FFS at 42 CFR 431.60, CHIP FFS at <br/>
42 CFR 457.730, Medicaid managed care at 42 CFR 438.242, CHIP managed care at 42 CFR <br/>
457.1233(d), and QHP issuers in FFEs at 45 CFR 156.221. These openly published APIs will <br/>
permit third-party applications to retrieve standardized data for adjudicated claims, encounters <br/>
with capitated and subcapitated providers, provider remittances, beneficiary cost-sharing, reports <br/>
of lab test results, provider directories, and preferred drug lists. To implement the new <br/>
requirements for APIs, we estimate that plans and states will conduct three major work phases:  <br/>
initial design; development and testing; and long-term support and maintenance.  <br/>
In the initial design phase, we believe tasks would include: determining available <br/>
resources (personnel, hardware, cloud space, etc.); assessing whether to use in-house resources to <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=174></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>174</b>  <br/>
facilitate an API connection or contract the work to a third party; convening a team to scope, <br/>
build, test, and maintain the API; performing a data availability scan to determine any gaps <br/>
between internal data models and the data required for the necessary FHIR resources; and, <br/>
mitigating any gaps discovered in the available data.  <br/>
During the development and testing phase, we believe plans and states would need to <br/>
conduct the following: map existing data to FHIR, which would constitute the bulk of the work <br/>
required for implementation; allocate hardware for the necessary environments (development, <br/>
testing, production); build a new FHIR server or leverage existing FHIR servers; determine the <br/>
frequency and method by which internal data is populated on the FHIR server; build connections <br/>
between the databases and FHIR server; perform capability and security testing; and vetting <br/>
third-party applications. <br/>
After the completion of the API development, we believe that plans and states would <br/>
need to conduct the following on an annual basis: allocate resources to maintain the FHIR server, <br/>
and perform capability and security testing. <br/>
The burden estimate related to the new requirements for APIs reflects the time and effort <br/>
needed to collect the information described above and disclose this information.  We estimate an <br/>
initial set one-time costs associated with the implementing the API requirements.  We presume <br/>
that it will take administrators and network architects 1440 hours (at $92.70 an hour), security <br/>
engineers 960 hours (at $101.32 an hour), computer and information analysts 480 hours (at <br/>
$83.96 an hour), operations research analysts 960 hours (at $74.66 an hour), software developers <br/>
960 hours (at $91.14 an hour), computer and information systems managers 720 hours (at <br/>
$142.20 an hour), general and operations managers 720 hours (at $145.02 an hour), designers <br/>
960 hours (at $58.64 an hour), technical writers 240 hours (at $65.36 an hour), and computer <br/>
systems analysts 960 hours (at $83.18 an hour). We estimate a one-time burden assessment of <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=175></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>175</b>  <br/>
8,400 (1440hrs + 960hrs + 480hrs + 960hrs + 960hrs + 720hrs + 720hrs + 960hrs + 240hrs + <br/>
960hrs) hours per organization or state and a total of 3,898,000 (8,400hrs x 345 organizations) <br/>
hours across all organizations or states.  The one-time cost to implement API requirements is <br/>
$789,356.00 per organization or state per implementation and $275,432,820 across all <br/>
organizations or states to complete the task described above. <br/>
Once the API is established, we believe that there would be an annual cost for performing <br/>
necessary capability and security testing, performing necessary upgrades and vetting of third-<br/>
party applications. We presume that it would take administrators and network architects 180 <br/>
hours (at $92.70 an hour), network and computer systems administrators 420 hours (at $87.28 an <br/>
hour), security engineers 240 hours (at $101.32 an hour), computer and information analysts 60 <br/>
hours (at $83.96 an hour), operations research analysts 120 hours (at $74.66 an hour), software <br/>
developers 240 hours (at $91.14 an hour), computer and information systems managers 90 hours <br/>
(at $142.20 an hour), general and operations managers 90 hours (at $145.02 an hour), designers <br/>
120 hours (at $58.64 an hour), technical writers 30 hours (at $65.36 an hour), and computer <br/>
systems analysts 120 hours (at $83.96 an hour). We estimate the total annual burden to be 1,710 <br/>
hours (180hrs + 420hrs + 60hrs + 120hrs + 240hrs + 90hrs + 120hrs + 30hrs + 120hrs) per <br/>
organization or state, and 589,950 hours (1,710hrs x 345 organizations) across all organizations <br/>
and states. Thus, the total annual cost to maintain the API requirements is $158,359.80 per <br/>
organization or state and $54,634,131 across all organizations and states.  <br/>

D. Exempt ICRs <br/>
1. Usual and Customary Business Practices  <br/>
While the requirements under 42 CFR 482.24(d), 482.61(f) and 485.638 are subject to the <br/>
PRA, we believe the burden associated with those requirements is exempt from the PRA in <br/>
accordance with 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2). We believe that the time, effort, and financial resources <br/>
necessary to comply with these requirements would be incurred by persons during the normal <br/>
course of their activities, and therefore, should be considered usual and customary business <br/>
practices.  <br/>
We are proposing to further expand CMS requirements for interoperability within the <br/>
hospital, psychiatric hospital, and CAH CoPs by focusing on electronic patient event <br/>
notifications. For hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs, we are proposing similar <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=177></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>177</b>  <br/>
requirements to revise the CoPs for Medicare- and Medicaid-participating hospitals, psychiatric <br/>
hospitals, and CAHs by adding a new standard, “Electronic Notifications,” that would require <br/>
hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs to send electronic patient event notifications of a <br/>
patient’s admission, discharge, and/or transfer to another health care facility or to another <br/>
community provider. We propose to limit this requirement to only those hospitals, psychiatric <br/>
hospitals, and CAHs which currently possess EHR systems with the technical capacity to <br/>
generate information for electronic patient event notifications, recognizing that not all Medicare- <br/>
and Medicaid-participating hospitals and psychiatric hospitals have been eligible for past <br/>
programs promoting adoption of EHR systems. We intend for these notifications to be required, <br/>
at minimum, for inpatients admitted to, and discharged and/or transferred from the hospital, <br/>
psychiatric hospital, or CAH. These requirements would help support coordination of a patient’s <br/>
care between settings or with services received through different care settings. These sections <br/>
would require updates to discharge planning processes, which has been a long-standing industry <br/>
practice. Electronic patient event notifications from these care settings, or clinical event <br/>
notifications, are one type of health information exchange intervention that has been increasingly <br/>
recognized as an effective and scalable tool for improving care coordination across settings. <br/>
These notifications are typically automated, electronic communications from the admitting or <br/>
discharging provider to a receiving facility or to another community provider that alert the <br/>
receiving provider that a patient is receiving, or has received, care at a different setting. <br/>
These notifications are based on “admission, discharge, and transfer” (ADT) messages, a <br/>
standard message used within an EHR as the vehicle for communicating information about key <br/>
changes in a patient’s status as they are tracked by the system (more information about the <br/>
current standard supporting these messages is available at <br/>
<a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=144">http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=144)</a>. As noted in the <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=178></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>178</b>  <br/>
ISA published by ONC, this messaging standard has been widely adopted across the health care <br/>
system (se<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isa/sending-a-notification-a-patients-admission-discharge-andor-transfer-status-other-providers">e https://www.healthit.gov/isa/sending-a-notification-a-patients-admission-discharge-</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isa/sending-a-notification-a-patients-admission-discharge-andor-transfer-status-other-providers">andor-transfer-status-other-providers).</a>  <br/>
We note that hospitals have an existing responsibility under the CoPs at 42 CFR <br/>
482.43(d) to transfer or refer patients, along with necessary medical information, to appropriate <br/>
facilities, agencies, or outpatient services, as needed, for follow-up or ancillary care. We wish to <br/>
emphasize that the proposal in this proposed rule around patient event notifications is <br/>
independent of the requirement regarding necessary medical information at 42 CFR 482.43(d). <br/>
As these processes are already required, and as many EHR systems already have an electronic <br/>
notification system in place, we do not anticipate a significant increase in burden on hospitals, <br/>
psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs with the adoption of this proposal. However, we recognize that <br/>
processes to implement this proposal, if finalized, might intersect with the hospital’s discharge <br/>
planning process. We note that nothing in this proposal would affect the hospital’s <br/>
responsibilities under 42 CFR 482.43(d). However, if this proposal is finalized, hospitals might <br/>
wish to consider ways to fulfill these requirements in ways that reduce redundancy while still <br/>
fully meeting the provisions of each. For instance, where appropriate, hospitals might seek to <br/>
include required necessary medical information within the same message as a patient event <br/>
notification. <br/>

<b>XVI.  Regulatory Impact Analysis </b><br/>
A.  Statement of Need <br/>
As described in detail in section III. of this proposed rule, the changes to 42 CFR parts <br/>
422, 431, 438, 457 and 45 CFR part 156 are part of the agency’s broader efforts to empower <br/>
patients by ensuring that they have full access to their own health care data, through common <br/>
technologies and without special effort, while keeping that information safe and secure. <br/>
Interoperability and the capability for health information systems and software applications to <br/>
communicate, exchange, and interpret data in a usable and readable format, such as pdf or text, is <br/>
vital, but allowing access to health care data through pdf and text format also limits the utility <br/>
and sharing of the data. Moving to a system in which patients have access of their health care <br/>
data will help empower them to make informed decisions about their health care, as well as share <br/>
their data with providers who can assist these patients with their health care.  Our proposals here <br/>
are designed to move the Medicare, MA, Medicaid, CHIP and QHP programs further to that <br/>
ultimate goal of empowering their enrollees.  As technology has advanced, we have encouraged <br/>
states, health plans, and providers to adopt various forms of technology to improve the accurate <br/>
and timely exchange of standardized health care information; these proposals would enable <br/>
beneficiaries and enrollees to be active partners in the exchange of electronic health care data by <br/>
easily monitoring or sharing their data. <br/>
States and CMS routinely exchange data on who is enrolled in Medicare, and which <br/>
parties are liable for paying that beneficiary’s Parts A and B premiums. These “buy-in” data <br/>
exchanges support state, CMS, and SSA premium accounting, collections, and enrollment <br/>
functions. We have become increasingly concerned about the limitations of monthly buy-in data <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=180></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>180</b>  <br/>
exchanges with states. The relatively long lag in updating buy-in data means that the state is not <br/>
able to terminate or activate buy-in coverage sooner, so the state or beneficiary may be paying <br/>
premiums for longer than appropriate. We note that once the data catch up, states and CMS <br/>
reconcile the premiums by recouping and re-billing, so premiums collected are ultimately <br/>
accurate, but only with– an administratively burdensome process involving debits and payments <br/>
between the beneficiary, state, CMS, SSA, and potentially providers. Daily buy-in data exchange <br/>
would reduce this administrative burden.  As described in detail in section VII. of this proposed <br/>
rule, the changes to 42 CFR parts 406, 407, and 423 establish frequency requirements that <br/>
necessitate all states to participate in daily exchange of buy-in data, and updates frequency <br/>
requirements to require all states to participate in daily exchange of MMA file data, with CMS <br/>
by April 1, 2022. <br/>
States submit data on files at least monthly to CMS to identify all dually eligible <br/>
individuals, including full-benefit and partial-benefit dually eligible beneficiaries (that is, those <br/>
who get Medicaid help with Medicare premiums, and often for cost-sharing). The MMA file was <br/>
originally developed to meet the need to timely identify dually eligible beneficiaries for the then-<br/>
new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Over time, we used these files’ data on dual <br/>
eligibility status to support Part C capitation risk-adjustment, and most recently, feeding dual <br/>
eligibility status to Part A and B eligibility and claims processing systems so providers, <br/>
suppliers, and beneficiaries have accurate information on beneficiary cost-sharing obligations.  <br/>
As CMS now utilizes MMA data on dual eligibility status in systems supporting all four parts of <br/>
the Medicare program, it is becoming even more essential that dual eligibility status is accurate <br/>
and up-to-date. Dual eligibility status can change at any time in a month. Waiting up to a month <br/>
for status updates can negatively impact access to the correct level of benefit at the correct level <br/>
of payment.    <br/>

B.  Overall Impact <b> </b> <br/>
We have examined the impacts of this proposed rule as required by Executive <br/>
Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993), Executive Order 13563 <br/>
on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011), the Regulatory Flexibility <br/>
Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96-354), section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, <br/>
section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (March 22, 1995; Pub. L. 104-4), <br/>
Executive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999), the Congressional Review Act <br/>
(5 U.S.C. 804(2)), and Executive Order 13771 on Reducing Regulation and Controlling <br/>
Regulatory Costs (January 30, 2017). <br/>
Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of <br/>
available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches <br/>
that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and <br/>
safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 defines a <br/>
“significant regulatory action” as an action that is likely to result in a rule:  (1) having an annual <br/>
effect on the economy of $100 million or more in any 1 year, or adversely and materially <br/>
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health <br/>
or safety, or state, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as “economically <br/>
significant”); (2) creating a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or <br/>
planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, <br/>
user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel <br/>
legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President’s priorities, or the principles set <br/>
forth in the Executive Order.   <br/>
A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) must be prepared for major rules with economically <br/>
significant effects ($100 million or more in any 1 year). We estimate that this rulemaking is <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=182></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>182</b>  <br/>
“economically significant” as measured by the $100 million threshold, and hence also a major <br/>
rule under the Congressional Review Act. Accordingly, we have prepared an RIA that to the best <br/>
of our ability presents the costs and benefits of the rulemaking. Table 3 summarizes the <br/>
estimated costs presented in the Collection of Information section of this proposed rule. We note <br/>
that estimates below do not account for enrollment growth or higher costs associated with <br/>
medical care. This is because the cost of requirements to implement patient access through APIs <br/>
and for states to comply with data exchange requirements are not impacted by enrollment growth <br/>
or higher costs associated with medical care. Per OMB guidelines, the projected estimates for <br/>
future years do not take into account ordinary inflation. <br/>

Allocation of Cost Impact by Program: As stated in the Collection of Information Section <br/>
of this proposed rule, cost estimates have been aggregated at the parent organization level <br/>
because we believe that an organization that offers commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP <br/>
products would create one system that would be used by all “plans” it offers. We note that due to <br/>
the implementation of APIs across multiple business lines, there is no straightforward method to <br/>
immediately estimate Parent Organization expenditures on how much of the cost is born by each <br/>
program.  <br/>
Preliminary Estimates: Later in this RIA section, we provide several detailed estimates of <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=183></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>183</b>  <br/>
cost by program where we account for Federal matching for Medicaid and payments by the Trust <br/>
Fund for Medicare Advantage Organizations. However, these estimates are approximate as <br/>
explained in detail below. Therefore, the purpose of this preliminary estimate section, is to <br/>
observe that the costs of this proposed rule are negligible relative to the costs of the various <br/>
programs it impacts.  <br/>
For purposes of clarification we use the metric of “costs per enrollee.” The “costs per <br/>
enrollee” whether for Medicaid or Medicare, does not refer to actual costs paid by the enrollee <br/>
but rather is a metric, it is the quotient of total program expenditures divided by total enrollees. <br/>
The cost per enrollee metric facilitates comparison of costs. Since program expenditures for both <br/>
Medicaid and MA are typically hundreds of millions (or billions) of dollars, concepts like <br/>
negligibility do not have intuitive meaning. Contrastively, the costs per enrollee are more <br/>
manageable and understandable. The 2018 Medicare Trust Fund<a href="CMSs.html#183">60</a> states that costs per enrollee <br/>
are projected to be roughly $12,000 - $14,000 for contract years 2020 - 2023 (Table IV.C3). The <br/>
costs per enrollee for the Medicaid program are similarly several thousand dollars. We estimate <br/>
169 million enrollees will be affected by these provisions since. Currently there are 76, 66<a href="CMSs.html#183">61, </a><br/>
20<a href="CMSs.html#183">62, a</a>nd 72 million enrollees in the commercial, Medicaid, MA and separate CHIP programs <br/>
respectively. <br/>
The total first year (implementation) cost per enrollee is $1.63 ($276.1 million cost <br/>
(Table 3) divided by 169 million enrollees); maintenance cost per enrollee in the following years <br/>
are 34 cents ($56.9 million total cost (Table 3) divided by 169 million enrollees). The assertion <br/>

that $1.63 and $0.34 is negligible compared to the $12,000 - $14,000 cost per enrollee for the <br/>
MA program or the several thousand-dollar cost per enrollee for the Medicaid program has <br/>
intuitive appeal. However, these are very rough preliminary estimates. In the remainder of this <br/>
RIA, we provide, subject to the limitations noted, more detailed impact by program. <br/>
Data Sources for Cost by Program: To obtain allocation of cost by program we used the <br/>
CMS public use files for MLR data, for 2016<a href="CMSs.html#184">63</a>,<a href="CMSs.html#184">64</a>The MLR data sets are for private insurance <br/>
plans but the issuers of that private (commercial) insurance in many cases also have contracts to <br/>
provide MA, Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans and report revenue, expense, and <br/>
enrollment data for these plans on the commercial MLR reporting form.   <br/>
Thus, these MLR data sets omit organizations that only have Medicare or Medicaid. The <br/>
data from the CMS MLR files also omits: (1) the CHIP program; and (2) Medicaid State <br/>
Agencies. We now discuss these omissions to assess the accuracy of using these MLR files.   <br/>
CHIP: 85 percent of the 194 CHIP managed care plans also offer Medicaid and hence are <br/>
covered by the parent entity. We believe it reasonable that the remaining CHIP plans also have <br/>
commercial offerings since it would be inefficient to operate a CHIP-only plan as the total <br/>
national CHIP enrollment is currently only about 7 million. Similarly, except for one state, CHIP <br/>
programs are run through the state Medicaid agency; again, there would be one interoperability <br/>
cost for the one state agency since the resulting software would be used both by Medicaid and <br/>
CHIP. Thus, while we are leaving out CHIP programs in this analysis since they are not in the <br/>
                                                           <br/>
63<a href="https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data-Resources/mlr.html"> https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data-Resources/mlr.html.</a> <br/>64  Although the 2017 MLR data recently became available, using them would not change the bottom line of the <br/>analysis. The 2016 data gives $113 billion, $157 billion and $370 billion enrollees for commercial, MA, and <br/>Medicaid plans respectively resulting in revenue proportions of 57.81 percent, 24.53 percent, 17.68 percent. The <br/>2017 data gives $119.5, $170.3 and $381.5 billion for commercial MA, and Medicaid plans resulting in proportions <br/>of 56.8 percent, 25.36 percent, and 17.79 percent. The 76 million commercial enrollees from the 2016 data <br/>decreased to 73.5 million in 2017. Using these alternate proportions and numbers would not change significantly our <br/>dollar-per-enrollee estimates of impacts. <br/>

CMS MLR files, we do not believe this materially alters the overall picture.  <br/>
Medicare Advantage: We compared the CMS MLR files with the CMS Trustee Report<a href="CMSs.html#185">65</a>. <br/>
According to the Trustee Report (Table IV.C2), total MA revenue for 2016 was $189.1 billion. <br/>
Thus, the reported amount in the CMS MLR files of $157 billion for MA represents 83 percent <br/>
(157/189.1) of all MA activity reflected in the Trustee Report. Therefore, we believe the <br/>
proportions obtained from these MLR files are accurate. <br/>
Medicaid: For the year for which these MLR files provide data, 2016, about 70 percent of <br/>
Medicaid enrollees were enrolled in Medicaid Managed Care.<a href="CMSs.html#185">66 </a>Thus although the MLR files <br/>
omit State Agencies, we believe that the 70 percent Medicaid enrollees enrolled in Medicaid <br/>
Managed Care provides a good approximation.  <br/>
Finally, as noted in the section “Preliminary Estimates”, independent of these omissions, <br/>
the average cost per enrollee is capped at $1.63 and $0.34 in first and follow up years. <br/>
Best Estimates of Impact per Program: We present two methods to obtain an estimate of <br/>
cost by program both for purposes of assessing impact on small entities, as well as for purposes <br/>
of assessing impacts of the provision on the Federal government, programs, and enrollees: We <br/>
could assume costs proportional to current enrollment, or alternatively, we could assume costs <br/>
proportional to total premium. For purposes of analyzing impact on small entities and impacts of <br/>
the provision on the Federal Government, programs, and enrollees we are using the method of <br/>
assuming costs proportional to total premium (the method of assuming costs proportional to <br/>
current enrollment will be used below to assess impact on transfers to enrollees). <br/>
Among issuers with products in both Commercial and MA or Commercial and Medicaid, <br/>
the 2016 CMS MLR files show $370 billion reported in premium for commercial plans, $157 <br/>

billion reported for MA, and $113 billion reported for Medicaid. Consequently, the proportion of <br/>
interoperability cost for each of the programs is 57.81 percent (370/(370+157+113)), 24.53 <br/>
percent (157/(370+157+113)), and 17.66 percent (113/(370+157+113)) for Commercial, MA , <br/>

Using these proportions, Table 4 breaks out the top row in Table 3, the total cost by year <br/>
of implementing and maintaining the API, by program. <br/>

Methods of Bearing Cost by Program: Commercial plans have the options to deal with <br/>
increased costs by either temporarily absorbing them (for purposes of market competitiveness), <br/>
increasing premiums to enrollees, or reducing benefits. <br/>
 <br/>
To the extent that issuers increase premiums for plans in the FFE, there would be Federal <br/>
premium tax credit (PTC) impacts.  However, the PTC formula is highly individual-specific, that <br/>
is, it is the result of the relationship between the premium of the second lowest-cost silver plan <br/>
applicable to a specific consumer in a specific month, the cost of the actual plan purchased by <br/>
that consumer for that month, and that consumer’s income.  Consequently, it would not be <br/>
possible to estimate the magnitude of the PTC impact with a reliable degree of accuracy, since <br/>
we cannot predict: (1) what proportion of costs would be passed on to enrollees as increased <br/>
premiums; (2) to what extent commercial issuers may recoup investment costs through raising <br/>
premiums on the second-lowest cost silver plans or on other plans; and (3) whether or in what <br/>
ways such premium increases may impact the PTC calculation or eligibility with respect to <br/>
various consumers,  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=187></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>187</b>  <br/>
 <br/>
To deal with this uncertainty, we list the possible Federal PTC impacts as a qualitative <br/>
impact. Most importantly, we assume the unlikely worst case scenario that all cost is passed on <br/>
as premium to the enrollee without subsidization; we then show that the net impact per enrollee <br/>
per month is extremely small (see Table 7).  <br/>
Medicare Advantage: Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) pass increased costs <br/>
back to the Trust Fund. For those (most) MAOs whose bid amount is below the benchmark, the <br/>
Trust Fund provides total expenditures to the MAOs consisting of:  (1) full payment of the bid <br/>
amount; and (2) the rebate, a portion of the difference between the benchmark and the bid <br/>
amount. Since MAOs are increasing their bid amounts to reflect the costs of this proposed rule, it <br/>
follows that the rebate, equaling the difference between the benchmark and bid, is decreased, <br/>
resulting in less rebates paid to the MAOs. Based on our historical and projected experience, the <br/>
rebate is estimated as 34 percent of the difference between benchmark and bid. Thus, although <br/>
the Trust Fund pays the bid in full, nevertheless, 66 percent of the increased bid costs arising <br/>
from this proposed rule, are reduced from the rebates. The MAO in its submitted bid, can address <br/>
this reduction of rebates by either:  (1) temporarily, for marketing purposes, absorbing the loss, <br/>
and reducing its profit margin; (2) reduce the additional benefits it provides the enrollee paid for <br/>
by the rebate; or (3) raise enrollee premiums. <br/>
Medicaid: State Medicaid agencies may be allowed to allocate the costs of state <br/>
information retrieval systems between the costs attributable to design, development, installation, <br/>
or enhancement of the system—at a 90 percent federal match—and for ongoing operations of the <br/>
system—at a 75 percent federal match.  <br/>
For Medicaid Managed Care entities, we assume an MCO, PIHP, and PAHP cost for <br/>
implementing the open API provisions would be built into the capitation rates and matched at the <br/>
State’s medical assistance match rate. For purposes of these estimates we use the weighted <br/>
<hr/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>188</b>  <br/>
FMAP, 58.44. <br/>
CHIP: Most states operate Medicaid and CHIP from the same state agency. One state is a <br/>
notable exception in that it has a separate Medicaid and CHIP agency. The federal government <br/>
pays an enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (EFMAP) to states for all costs <br/>
associated with CHIP, including systems costs (this is unlike Medicaid where there are different <br/>
FMAPs for different types of costs). For federal FY 2019 the EFMAPs will range from 88 to 100 <br/>
percent. For federal FY 2020 the EFMAPs will range from approximately 76.5 to 93 percent. <br/>
After federal FY 2020, the EFMAPs will range from approximately 65 to 81.5 percent. Since the <br/>
CHIP program Federal rebate ranges include the 90 percent and 75 percent federal matching <br/>
proportions of the Medicaid program, we are applying the 90 percent and 75 percent from <br/>
Medicaid to the CHIP programs. Since the CHIP program is small relative to the Medicaid <br/>
program, we believe this approach reasonable. <br/>
Table 5 uses these proportions to estimate the impact of the API on the Federal <br/>
Government. For example, the $28.4 million cost to the Federal government for Medicaid/CHIP <br/>
for 2020, the implementation year of the API, is obtained by multiplying the State Agency <br/>
Medical Assistance average match rate to Medicaid Managed Care Plans, 58.44%, by the $48.6 <br/>
million total cost to Medicaid for 2020 listed in Table 4. <br/>

($48.6 million total cost for 2020 (Table 4) - $28.4 million matched by Medicaid State Agencies <br/>

The further discussion of bearing these costs, is clarified, if we reformulate the costs in <br/>
terms of costs per enrollee. To do this we use enrollments by program. For commercial <br/>
enrollment we use the 2016 MLR data, for MA enrollment we use the August 2018 data, and for <br/>
Medicaid and CHIP we use September 2018 data. These enrollment numbers are 76, 66<a href="CMSs.html#189">67, 2068, </a><br/>
and 74 million enrollees in the commercial, Medicaid, MA and separate CHIP programs <br/>
respectively. Thus, for purposes of this analysis, we use a total of 169 million (76+67+20+6) <br/>
enrollees in all programs. Table 7 presents cost per enrollee by program and year. For example, <br/>
there is a 28-cent cost to Medicaid/CHIP state agencies in 2020 (20.3 million remaining cost <br/>
(Table 6) divided by 73 million (66 million Medicaid + 7 million CHIP)).<a href="CMSs.html#189">69 </a><br/>

The <br/>resulting per-enrollee-per-year cost impacts would be $2.17, 0.28, and $2.04 versus the numbers in Table 7 which <br/>are $2.10, 0.28, and $2.24. These changes per enrollee per year would not affect any of our conclusions about <br/>negligibility relative to the 4 and 5 digit per enrollee per year expenses for Medicare, Medicaid and the Federally <br/>Funded exchange.  <br/>

 <br/>
Using Table 7 we can assess the approximate impact of the remaining cost. <br/>
Commercial:  As pointed out above, the Commercial program has the options of <br/>
absorbing costs or passing costs to enrollees either in the form of premiums or reduced benefits. <br/>
The cost per enrollee in 2021 through 2024 is under a half dollar and could comfortably be <br/>
passed on to enrollees. For purposes of market competitiveness, it is very likely that some of the <br/>
2020 cost of $2.10 per enrollee will be absorbed by each QHP in an FFE.  <br/>
Medicaid: Medicaid state agencies are adding a cost under 30 cents per enrollee for 2020-<br/>
2024. Since total costs per enrollee for the Medicaid program are several thousand dollars we do <br/>
not believe this additional 30 cents per enrollee cost to be a significant burden. <br/>
Medicare Advantage: Medicare Advantage plans in their June-submitted bids would <br/>
address the reduced rebates (arising from increased bid costs due to the increased costs of this <br/>
proposed rule being included in the bid)  by either:  (1) temporarily absorbing costs by reducing <br/>
profit margins; (2) reducing additional benefits paid for by the rebates; or (3) raising enrollee <br/>
cost sharing (however, many plans for competitive reasons would chose to remain zero premium <br/>
and either absorb losses for one year or reduce additional, rebate-funded benefits in the amount <br/>
per enrollee shown in Table 7). <br/>
Table 8 summarizes these methods of bearing the remaining costs. <br/>

<b>Potential Plan </b><br/>
Commercial plans have the options of absorbing costs (for example, in 2020 for reasons of market <br/>
Commercial <br/>
competitiveness), increasing premiums to enrollees, or reducing benefits. <br/>Medicaid Managed Care plan would bear the cost (under a dime per enrollee) which is negligible <br/>
Medicaid/CHIP <br/>
compared to current costs per enrollee. <br/>
MA plans in their June-submitted bids would address the reduced rebates (arising from increased bid <br/>
Medicare <br/>
costs due to the increased costs of this proposed rule being included in the bid)  by either:  (1) <br/>
Advantage <br/>
temporarily absorbing costs by reducing profit margins; (2) reducing additional benefits paid for by <br/>
(MA) <br/>
the rebates; or (3) raising enrollee cost sharing (however, many plans for competitive reasons would <br/>chose to remain zero premium and either absorb losses for one year or reduce additional, rebate-<br/>funded benefits in the amount per enrollee shown in Table 7). <br/>
 <br/>
C.  Anticipated Effects <br/>
The RFA, as amended, requires agencies to analyze options for regulatory relief of small <br/>
businesses, if a rule has a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For <br/>
purposes of the RFA, small entities include small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and small <br/>
governmental jurisdictions. <br/>
This proposed rule affects (1) Commercial Issuers (2) MA plans, including those that are <br/>
also Part D sponsors of MA-PD plans, as well as (3) Medicaid MCOs with a minimum threshold <br/>
for small business size of $38.5 milli<a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-guide/size-standards">on (https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-guide/size-standards">guide/size-standards)</a>).  <br/>
Assessment of impact is complicated by the fact that costs have been aggregated at the <br/>
Parent Organization level. A typical Parent Organization might have products with the <br/>
commercial, MA, or Medicaid /CHIP programs. We have no way of directly assessing the size of <br/>
Parent Organizations. Therefore, as a proxy, we analyze each program separately. <br/>
Medicare Advantage: We first assess the impact on MA plans. To clarify the flow of <br/>
payments between these entities and the federal government, we note that MAOs submit <br/>
proposed plan designs and estimates of the amount of revenue necessary to cover the cost of <br/>
those plan designs (called bids) by the first Monday in June of the year preceding the coverage <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=192></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>192</b>  <br/>
year. Regulations governing this process are in 42 CFR part 422, subpart F.  These bids must be <br/>
broken down in the following: <br/>
(1) The revenue requirements for providing Medicare Part A and Part B benefits with <br/>
actuarially equivalent cost sharing (this is the “basic benefit bid”);  <br/>
(2) The revenue requirements for providing supplemental benefits; and <br/>
(3) A Part D bid consistent with Part D regulations in 42 CFR part 423. <br/>
These bids project payments to hospitals, providers and staff, as well as the cost of <br/>
administration and profits.  Because the API requirements proposed in this rule will apply to <br/>
every MA plan and each MA plan must furnish at least the Medicare Part A and Part B benefits, <br/>
the cost of the API will be built into the administrative component of the basic benefit bid. These <br/>
bids in turn determine one component of the payments of the Medicare Trust Fund to the MAOs <br/>
who reimburse providers and other stakeholders for their services. A second component of the <br/>
Trust Fund payment to MAOs are the rebates, which are a portion  of the difference between the  <br/>
basic benefit bid compared to an administratively-set benchmark for the MA plan’s service area <br/>
(currently, based on our past and projected experience, rebates are approximately 66 percent) <br/>
Benchmarks are based on a formula using an estimate of the Medicare FFE per capita cost for <br/>
the geographic area, which are adjusted to reflect the per capita cost of each county in the United <br/>
States and its territories.  Payments from the Medicare Trust Funds for monthly capitation are <br/>
capped at the benchmark; for basic benefit bids under the benchmark, a portion, currently 66 <br/>
percent, of the difference between the bid and benchmark is made available to the MA <br/>
organization to either: (1) pay the premium for supplemental benefits; (2) include reductions in <br/>
cost sharing; (3) provide additional non-Medicare covered benefits; or (4) provide buy-downs of <br/>
Part B or Part D premiums. Basic benefit bids that are at or above the benchmark receive <br/>
payment from the Trust Funds of the benchmark amount, with any excess charged to the enrollee <br/>
<hr/>

<b> </b><br/>

as a premium.  <br/>
 <br/>
MAOs are made aware of the benchmark through the annual CMS publication, <br/>
“Medicare<b> </b>Advantage Capitation Rates and Medicare Advantage and Part D Payment Policies <br/>
and Final Call Letter,” which, consistent with section 1853 of the Act, is released prior to MAO <br/>
submission of bids. Therefore, the bids of most MAOs are below the benchmark and <br/>
consequently most MAOs receive from the Trust Fund a total expenditure equaling payment for <br/>
the bid plus the rebate. <br/>
 <br/>
Because of these proposed API provisions, MAOs would be raising the June-submitted <br/>
bid amount to reflect additional costs. While the Trust Fund pays these bid amounts in full, the <br/>
rebate goes down: That is, since the bid amount goes up, the rebate, equaling the difference <br/>
between the benchmark and bid, decreases and results in less rebate payment to the MAO. The <br/>
MAO has several options of dealing with these increased bid costs and reduced rebates: The <br/>
MAO might decide to:  (1) temporarily absorb the loss by reducing its profit margin (so as to <br/>
reduce the bid amount and thereby increase the rebates); (2) reduce additional benefits paid to <br/>
the enrollee from the rebates; or (3) raise enrollee premiums so as to compensate for the <br/>
reduction of enrollee premium that would have happened if the bid had not been increased (note: <br/>
for marketing purposes, many plans operate at zero premium, and we do not consider this a <br/>
likely possibility). In this RIA we have referred to options (2) and (3) reduction of additional <br/>
benefits and raising of enrollee premiums as “passing the costs to the enrollee” the intent being <br/>
that the “effect” of reduced rebates is less additional benefits or higher enrollee premiums than <br/>
would have happened had the cost of the provisions of this proposed rule not been included in <br/>
the bid. <br/>
There are various types of Medicare health plans, including MA HMOs, POS plans, and <br/>
PPOs; Demonstration plans; Cost Plans; Prescription Drug Plans (PDP); and Programs of All-<br/>
<hr/>

Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) organizations. This proposed rule affects MA HMOs, MA <br/>
POS plans, and MA PPOs but does not affect Cost Plans, Prescription Drug Plans nor PACE <br/>
organizations.   <br/>
There are a variety of ways to assess whether MAOs meet the $38.5 million threshold for <br/>
small businesses. The assessment can be done by examining net worth, net income, cash flow <br/>
from operations and projected claims as indicated in their bids. Using projected monetary <br/>
requirements and projected enrollment for 2018 from submitted bids, 32 percent of the MAOs <br/>
fell below the $38.5 million threshold for small businesses. Additionally, an analysis of 2016 <br/>
data, the most recent year for which we have actual data on MAO net worth, shows that 33 <br/>
percent of all MAOs fall below the minimum threshold for small businesses. <br/>
Medicaid: We next assess the impact on Medicaid MCOs. The Society of Actuaries <br/>
(SOA) published “Medicaid Managed Care Organizations: Considerations in Calculating Margin <br/>
in Rate Setting” in 2017.<a href="CMSs.html#194">70 </a>The report provided an MS Excel spreadsheet of Medicaid MCOs <br/>
using data from 2013 – 2015. That report noted that “[n]ot every state requires Medicaid MCOs <br/>
to submit Annual Statements, so not every MCO is represented. MCOs in California and Arizona <br/>
are shown with a limited set of metrics, based on what was available and provided by HMA <br/>
[Health Management Associates].” Of the 231 MCOs listed in the 2015 worksheet, 196 provided <br/>
data that are adequate to identify MCOs with annual “revenue” less than $38.5 million. (NOTE: <br/>
Since total revenue is reported at the company level, which includes revenue from non-Medicaid <br/>
sources, we used “direct premium written” in the Medicaid portion of the worksheet as a proxy <br/>
for annual revenue on the individual plan level.)  Of the 196 Medicaid MCOs, only 15 MCOs or <br/>
7.7 percent had “revenue” less than $38.5 million in 2015. <br/>

Commercial:  Based on the 2016 CMS MLR data, approximately 85 out of 494, or 17 <br/>
percent of companies (that either had only commercial business, or had commercial plus <br/>
Medicare and/or Medicaid business) had total premium revenue of less than $38,500,000. In <br/>
other words, for MA, Medicaid, and Commercial, a significant number of small plans are <br/>
affected. The RFA requires us to assess whether the rule has a significant impact on the plans <br/>
which we do next.  <br/>
If a proposed rule has a substantial impact on a substantial number of small entities, the <br/>
proposed rule must discuss steps taken, including alternatives, to minimize burden on small <br/>
entities. While a significant number (more than 5 percent) of not-for-profit organizations and <br/>
small businesses are affected by this final rule, the impact is not significant. To assess impact, we <br/>
use the data in Table 3 of this section which shows that the total raw (not discounted) net effect <br/>
of this final rule over 5 years is 500 million dollars.  <br/>
Medicare Advantage: We first assess impact on MA plans. Comparing the 500 million <br/>
dollar number to the total monetary amounts projected to be needed just for 2018, the most <br/>
recent year on which we have finalized plan submitted bid data (and which is expected to be less <br/>
than the need in future years including 2019), we find that that the impact of this proposed rule is <br/>
significantly below the 3 percent-5 percent threshold for significant impact for MA plans. <br/>
Medicaid:  We next assess impact on Medicaid Managed Care plans. The total projected <br/>
capitation payment and premiums for 2019 is projected to be $337.6 billion.<a href="CMSs.html#195">71</a> Hence, the total <br/>
cost of this proposed rule over 5 years, $500 million, is significantly below the 3 percent-5 <br/>
percent threshold for significant impact to Medicaid Managed Care plans.  <br/>

<b>196</b>  <br/>
Commercial:  As discussed prior to Table 4, based on data in the public, CMS MLR files, <br/>
commercial plans had a revenue of at least $370 billion in 2016. We say at least, because this <br/>
only includes organizations with either: (1) only commercial; (2) both commercial and MA; or <br/>
(3) both commercial and Medicaid.  Had all organizations been included in the CMS MLR files <br/>
(including those that only offer MA and/or Medicaid) the amount would be greater than $370 <br/>
billion. Therefore, the aggregate raw cost of this proposed rule over 5 years, $500 million, is <br/>
significantly below the 3 percent – 5 percent threshold for significant impact to Commercial <br/>
plans. <br/>
We conclude, that although a significant number of small plans in all programs are <br/>
affected by this rule, this impact is not significant. <br/>
Besides the fact that the impact is not significant, we are not concerned that small plans <br/>
will have a burden in implementing these requirements since as indicated above, without <br/>
considering any rebates or Federal matching funds, the cost of this provision is $1.63 per <br/>
enrollee per year in the first implementation year, and $0.34 in the following years for <br/>
maintenance, these per enrollee costs are negligible when compared to the typical costs per <br/>
enrollee (several thousand dollars).   <br/>
Consequently, the Secretary has determined that this proposed rule will not have a <br/>
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and the requirements of the <br/>
RFA have been met. Please see our detailed analysis of apportionment of costs per program and <br/>
plan in Tables 4 through 8 and section XVI.H. of this proposed rule for further details. <br/>
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires CMS to prepare an RIA if a rule may <br/>
have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.  This <br/>
analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section <br/>
1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside a <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=197></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>

Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 100 beds. We are not preparing an analysis for <br/>
section 1102(b) of the Act because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this <br/>
proposed rule would not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of <br/>
small rural hospitals. <br/>
Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Pub. L. 104-04, <br/>
enacted March 22, 1995) also requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before <br/>
issuing any rule whose mandates require spending in any 1 year of $100 million in 1995 dollars, <br/>
updated annually for inflation.  In 2018, that is approximately $150 million. The apportionment <br/>
of total cost between the MA, Medicaid, Commercial and Chip programs is detailed in both <br/>
section XVI.B. (Tables 4 through 8) and section XVI.H of this RIA showing that costs for both <br/>
enrollees and the states are small. Executive Order 13132 establishes certain requirements that an <br/>
agency must meet when it promulgates a proposed rule (and subsequent final rule) that imposes <br/>
substantial direct requirement costs on state and local governments, preempts state law, or <br/>
otherwise has Federalism implications. This rule will not have a substantial direct effect on state <br/>
or local governments, preempt state law, or otherwise have a Federalism implication. Therefore, <br/>
the requirements of Executive Order 13132 are not applicable.   <br/>
 If regulations impose administrative costs, such as the time needed to read and interpret <br/>
this proposed rule, we should estimate the cost associated with regulatory review. There are <br/>
currently 288 organizations and 56 states and territories.  We assume each organization will have <br/>
one designated staff member who will read the entire rule. <br/>
Using the wage information from the BLS for medical and health service managers <br/>
(Code 11–9111), we estimate that the cost of reviewing this rule is $139.14 per hour, including <br/>
overhead and fringe benefits <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics5_524114.htm">(https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics5_524114.htm).</a> Assuming <br/>
an average reading speed, we estimate that it would take approximately 6 hours for each person <br/>

<b>198</b>  <br/>
to review this proposed rule. For each plan and state that reviews the rule, the estimated cost is <br/>
$834.84 (6 hours × $139.14). Therefore, we estimate that the total cost of reviewing this <br/>
regulation is $288,020 ($834.84 × 345 reviewers). <br/>
1.  Requirements for Patient Access Through APIs <br/>
To promote our commitment to interoperability, we are proposing new requirements in <br/>
section III. of this proposed rule for MA organizations at 42 CFR 422.119, Medicaid FFS at 42 <br/>
CFR 431.60, Medicaid managed care at 42 CFR 438.242, CHIP FFS at 42 CFR 457.730, CHIP <br/>
managed care at 42 CFR 457.1233, and QHP issuers, excluding SADP issuers, that offer plans <br/>
through the FFE at 45 CFR 156.221 to implement open APIs for making certain data available to <br/>
enrollees and the public. These openly published APIs will permit third-party applications to <br/>
retrieve standardized data for adjudicated claims, encounters with capitated and subcapitated <br/>
providers, provider remittances, beneficiary cost-sharing, reports of lab test results, provider <br/>
directories, and preferred drug lists. We believe that these proposals are designed to empower <br/>
patients by mandating that entities subject to our API proposal take steps – by implementing the <br/>
API – to enable enrollees to have access to their data in a usable digital format and have <br/>
(potentially) easier means to share that data. By making these data readily available and portable <br/>
to the patient, these initiatives support moving our healthcare system away from a FFS payment <br/>
system that pays for volume and toward a payment system that pays for value and quality by <br/>
reducing duplication of services, adding efficiency to provider visits, and facilitating <br/>
identification of fraud, waste, and abuse.   <br/>
To estimate the number of impacted issuers, we reviewed parent organizations of health <br/>
plans across MA, Medicaid MCOs, and QHPs in FFEs to remove organizations that would not <br/>
be subject to our proposal, such as SADPs; transportation plans and brokers such as non-<br/>
emergency medical transportation (NEMTs) brokers; PACE; visiting nurse and home health care <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=199></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>199</b>  <br/>
organizations; senior organizations such as Area Agencies on Aging; and other organizations <br/>
such as community action programs. After removing these organizations, we then reviewed the <br/>
remaining names of parent organizations and health plans in the National Association of <br/>
Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Consumer Information Support (CIS) system to determine the <br/>
legal name of the entity and whether the entity was registered with the NAIC. We also used the <br/>
2018 NAIC Listing of Companies to determine whether various health plans had associated <br/>
parent organizations using the NAIC’s Group coding and numbering system. If the health plan or <br/>
parent organization did not appear in the NAIC CIS or in the 2018 NAIC Listing of Companies, <br/>
we then reviewed the name of the entity in the Securities and Exchange online Edgar system to <br/>
locate the entity’s Form 10-K filing, which includes an Exhibit (Exhibit 21) that requires the <br/>
entity to list its subsidiaries. If the health plan or organization did not appear in these online <br/>
systems or listings, an online internet search using Google search engine was conducted. After <br/>
review, we have determined that 288 issuers and 56 states, territories, and U.S. commonwealths, <br/>
which operate FFS programs, will be subject to the API provisions for Medicare, Medicaid, and <br/>
the Commercial market. To this we add the one state that operates its CHIP and Medicaid <br/>
separately. Thus, we have a total of 345 parent entities (288+56+1). We note that although 42 <br/>
states have some lower-income children in an expansion of Medicaid, and some higher-income <br/>
children or pregnant women in a separate CHIP, all but one of these programs are operated out of <br/>
the same agency.  Although the CHIP programs may be distinct, we believe they will use the <br/>
same infrastructure built for Medicaid. Thus, the addition of 1 parent entity for CHIP is <br/>
reasonable and plausible.  <br/>
As noted in section XIII.C.3. of this proposed rule, to implement the new requirements <br/>
for APIs, we estimate that organizations and states would conduct three major work phases: <br/>
initial design; development and testing; and long-term support and maintenance. (For a detailed <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=200></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>200</b>  <br/>
description of these phases, see section XIII.C.3. of this proposed rule.) <br/>
 <br/>
As part of our research into the regulatory impact, we reviewed a sample of health plan <br/>
organizations offering MA plans to determine whether any currently offer patient portal <br/>
functionality with the MA plan. If yes, we reviewed whether they offered the opportunity to <br/>
connect to Medicare’s Blue Button 2.0. Health plan organizations offering MA plans were <br/>
identified from June 2018 data and statistics compiled at<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MCRAdvPartDEnrolData/index.html"> https://www.cms.gov/Research-</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MCRAdvPartDEnrolData/index.html">Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MCRAdvPartDEnrolData/index.html. </a><br/>
We initially reviewed the functionality offered by three organizations which together enroll over <br/>
half of MA members through review of publicly-available information such as press releases and <br/>
website informational materials. We found from this review that these organizations not only <br/>
offered patient portals primarily focused on claims and user-entered data on their website, but <br/>
that all three also offered enrollees the opportunity to connect to Blue Button. We then identified <br/>
a selection of other health plan organizations at random and conducted the same evaluation. <br/>
Results indicate that the majority of the health plan organizations we reviewed offer patients a <br/>
way to access claims data and other information via their websites and sometimes via <br/>
applications. Regarding Blue Button access, results were either negative or unclear. <br/>
 <br/>
We also cross-referenced health plan organizations offering MA plans with health plan <br/>
organizations that offer plans in the Federal Employee Health Benefit (FEHB) program because <br/>
a percentage of those organizations offer plans with patient portal access and Blue Button <br/>
functionality. The FEHB, administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), reported <br/>
in 2014 that 90 percent of its participating plans offered enrollees access to a personal health <br/>
record on the organization’s website. In addition, OPM reported that over half of the FEHB <br/>
participating plans expected to offer Blue Button functionality by January 1, 2016. We sought to <br/>
learn whether there was any overlap between these two lists of organizations to gauge whether <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=201></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>201</b>  <br/>
additional organizations may already have the capability to offer either patient portals or Blue <br/>
Button, albeit in a different business arm, as having internal capability may assuage some of the <br/>
cost of building out a new API to support patient access to claims data. While we found <br/>
significant overlap between UnitedHealthcare and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Affiliates, we also <br/>
were able to identify other organizations that offer both MA plans and plans included in the <br/>
FEHB. While not definitive, this data allows us to draw the conclusion that a number of health <br/>
plan organizations have the technology in place to offer patient portals to MA enrollees and, <br/>
further, also have the ability to offer MA enrollees Blue Button functionality. <br/>
As detailed in the Collection of Information section of this proposed rule and summarized <br/>
in Table 3, given the current state of interoperability, we estimate the burden related to the new <br/>
requirements for APIs to have an initial set one-time costs of $798,356 per implementation or an <br/>
aggregate cost of $275,432,820 ($798,356 x 345 parent entities). For a detailed discussion of the <br/>
one-time costs associated with implementing the API requirements we refer readers to section <br/>
XIII.C.3. of this proposed rule. Once the API is established we believe that there will be an <br/>
annual cost for performing necessary capability and security testing, performing necessary <br/>
upgrades and vetting of third party applications. We estimate the burden related to the <br/>
requirements for APIs to have an annual cost of $158,406 per implementation or an aggregate <br/>
cost of $54,650,070 (345 parent entities x $158,406).  For a detailed discussion of the annual <br/>
costs associated with implementing the API requirements, we refer readers to section XIII.C.3. <br/>
of this proposed rule. <br/>
We are committed to fulfilling our role in promoting interoperability, putting patients <br/>
first and ensuring they have access to their health care data. We recognize that there are <br/>
significant opportunities to modernize access to patient data and its ability to share across the <br/>
health ecosystem. We realize the importance of interoperability and the capability for health <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=202></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>202</b>  <br/>
information systems and software applications to communicate, exchange, and interpret data in a <br/>
usable and readable format. Although allowing access to healthcare data through pdf and text <br/>
format is vital, it limits the utility of the data, and its ability to be easily accessed and shared. <br/>
Additionally, we realize that moving to a system in which patients have access to their healthcare <br/>
data will ultimately empower them to make informed decisions about their healthcare.  Our <br/>
proposals here do not go as far as our goals for how patients will be ultimately empowered but <br/>
take steps in that direction. <br/>
We note that the federal government has spent over $35 billion under the EHR Incentive <br/>
Programs<a href="CMSs.html#202">72</a> to incentivize the adoption of EHR systems; however, despite the fact that 78 percent <br/>
of physicians and 96 percent of hospitals now use an EHR system<a href="CMSs.html#202">73</a>, progress on system-wide <br/>
data sharing has been limited. Previous attempts to advance interoperability have made <br/>
incremental progress but have failed to align the necessary stakeholders to drive momentum in a <br/>
single direction. Recently, the Administration launched the MyHealthEData initiative.<a href="CMSs.html#202">74</a> This <br/>
government-wide initiative aims to empower patients by ensuring that they have full access to <br/>
their own healthcare data and the ability to decide how their data will be used, while keeping that <br/>
information safe and secure. MyHealthEData aims to break down the barriers that prevent <br/>
patients from gaining electronic access to their healthcare data and allow them to access that data <br/>
from the device or application of their choice that will connect to a plan’s API, empowering <br/>
patients and taking a critical step toward interoperability and patient data exchange.  <br/>
Health plans should have the ability to exchange data instantly with other payers for care <br/>

coordination or transitions, and with providers to facilitate more efficient care. Health plans are <br/>
in a unique position to provide enrollees a complete picture of their claims and encounter data, <br/>
allowing patients to piece together their own information that might otherwise be lost in <br/>
disparate systems. We are committed to solving the issue of interoperability and achieving <br/>
complete patient access in the U.S. health care system and are taking an active approach using all <br/>
available policy levers and authorities available to move all participants in the health care market <br/>
toward interoperability and the secure exchange of health care data. The modern internet app <br/>
economy thrives on an open API software environment. Part of the health care API evolution is <br/>
incorporating many of the current protocols from leading standards development organizations <br/>
with the newer Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) web developer-friendly way <br/>
of representing clinical data. <br/>
2.  Increasing the Frequency of Federal-State Data Exchanges for Dually Eligible Individuals  <br/>
We routinely exchange data with states on who is enrolled in Medicare, and which parties <br/>
are liable for paying that beneficiary’s Part A and B premiums. These buy-in data exchanges <br/>
support state, CMS, and SSA premium accounting, collections, and enrollment functions. CMS <br/>
subregulatory guidance, specifically Chapter 3 of the State Buy-in Manual, specifies that states <br/>
should exchange buy-in data with CMS at least monthly, but provides the option for states to <br/>
exchange buy-in data with CMS daily or weekly. Likewise, states can choose to receive the CMS <br/>
response data on a file daily or monthly. Currently, 31 states and the District of Columbia now <br/>
submit buy-in data to CMS, daily and 28 states and the District of Columbia receive buy-in <br/>
response files from CMS daily. <br/>
We are proposing to establish the frequency requirements in the regulation itself to <br/>
require all states to participate in daily exchange of buy-in data to CMS, with “daily” meaning <br/>
every business day, but that if no new transactions are available to transmit, data would not need <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=204></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>204</b>  <br/>
to be submitted on a given business day. We propose that states would be required to begin <br/>
participating in daily exchange of buy-in data with CMS by April 1, 2022. <br/>
We estimate the cost for states to comply with these new requirements to be one-time <br/>
costs associated with state systems updates, totaling $3,273,965 across impacted states and over <br/>
the 3-year implementation period. We first identified those states already exchanging data daily, <br/>
and then determined there are 19 states that we anticipate will need to make a systems change to <br/>
send buy-in data to CMS daily, and 22 states that we anticipate will need to make a systems <br/>
change to receive buy-in data from CMS daily. We then estimated that each change would <br/>
involve 960 hours of computer analyst time at $83.18 per hour, for a one-time cost to be a little <br/>
less than $80,000 per state, per change. So, a state that needs to make systems updates to both <br/>
send buy-in data daily, and receive buy-in data daily would have a one-time cost of just under <br/>
$160,000. We did not estimate any savings related to exchanging buy-in data with greater <br/>
frequency, as data lags only delay when states are billed for premium costs; delays do not impact <br/>
the effective date and total costs. While we did not estimate premium savings (since premium <br/>
collection is ultimately correct), we anticipate that states may experience longer term reduction <br/>
in administrative burden of making those corrections.  <br/>
States submit data on MMA files at least monthly to CMS to identify all dually eligible <br/>
individuals, including full-benefit and partial-benefit dually eligible beneficiaries (that is, those <br/>
who get Medicaid help with Medicare premiums, and often cost-sharing). While 42 CFR <br/>
423.910(d) requires states to submit at least one MMA file each month, states have the option to <br/>
submit multiple MMA files throughout the month (up to one per day). As CMS now utilizes <br/>
MMA data on dual eligibility status in systems supporting all four parts of the Medicare <br/>
program, it is becoming even more essential that dual eligibility status is accurate and up-to-date.  <br/>
We are proposing to update the frequency requirements in 42 CFR 423.910(d) to require <br/>

<b>205</b>  <br/>
that starting April 1, 2022, all states submit the required MMA file data to CMS daily, and to <br/>
make conforming edits to 42 CFR 423.910(b)(1). Daily would mean every business day, but that <br/>
if no new transactions are available to transmit, data would not need to be submitted on a given <br/>
business day. We estimate the cost for states to comply with these new requirements to be a one-<br/>
time cost associated with state systems updates, totaling $3,034,406 across impacted states, and <br/>
across the 3 years which states have to implement the requirement. There are 37 states and the <br/>
District of Columbia that we anticipate will need to make a systems change to send MMA data to <br/>
CMS daily. We estimate the one-time cost for a state to be a little less than $80,000 for this <br/>
MMA data systems change. For a detailed discussion of the costs associated with these <br/>
requirements we refer readers to section XIII.C. of this proposed rule. We did not estimate any <br/>
savings related to submitting MMA files daily, as data lags only delay when data are sent; delays <br/>
do not impact the effective date and total costs. While we did not estimate savings, we anticipate <br/>
that states may experience longer term reduction in administrative burden.  <br/>
If these proposals are finalized as proposed, we anticipate that states would have <br/>
approximately 3 years to implement daily exchange of buy-in and MMA data. For each state <br/>
there would be a one-time cost to make needed systems changes, and thereafter, no new on-<br/>
going costs. States will have the ability to choose, in consultation with CMS, when in the 3-year <br/>
implementation period they want to make this change, with numerous factors impacting in which <br/>
year they would do so. For the purposes of this impact analysis, we estimated an even <br/>
distribution beginning in May 2019 and ending in April 2022. The total cost impact over the 3-<br/>
year implementation period for this provision is $6,308,371 ($3,273,965 +$3,034,406), <br/>
comprising $0.7 million in FY 2019, $2.2 million in FY 2020, $2.2 million in FY 2021, and $1.2 <br/>
million in FY 2022. Since the proposed effective date is April 1, 2022, we estimate no costs for <br/>
FY 2023.   <br/>

3. Revisions to the Conditions of Participation for Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals <br/>
(CAHs) <br/>
We are seeking to further expand CMS requirements for interoperability within the <br/>
hospital and CAH CoPs by focusing on electronic patient event notifications. We are proposing <br/>
new requirements in section X. of this proposed rule for hospitals at 42 CFR 482.24(d)), for <br/>
psychiatric hospitals at 42 CFR 482.61(f), and for CAHs at 42 CFR 485.638. Specifically, for <br/>
hospitals, psychiatric hospitals and CAHs, we are proposing similar requirements to revise the <br/>
CoPs for Medicare- and Medicaid-participating hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs by <br/>
adding a new standard, “Electronic Notifications,” that would require hospitals, psychiatric <br/>
hospitals, and CAHs to make electronic patient event notifications available to another <br/>
healthcare facility or to another community provider. We propose to limit this requirement to <br/>
only those hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs which currently possess EHR systems with <br/>
the technical capacity to generate information for electronic patient event notifications, <br/>
recognizing that not all Medicare- and Medicaid-participating hospitals have been eligible for <br/>
past programs promoting adoption of EHR systems. We propose that these notifications would <br/>
need to be sent at admission and either immediately prior to or at the time of the patient’s <br/>
discharge or transfer to licensed and qualified practitioners, other patient care team members, <br/>
and PAC services providers and suppliers that:  (1) receive the notification for treatment, care <br/>
coordination, or quality improvement purposes; (2) have an established care relationship with the <br/>
patient relevant to his or her care; and (3) for whom the hospital, psychiatric hospital, or CAH <br/>
has a reasonable certainty of receipt of notifications. As we noted, infrastructure supporting the <br/>
exchange of electronic health information across settings has matured substantially in recent <br/>
years. Research studies have increasingly found that health information exchange interventions <br/>
can effectuate positive outcomes in health care quality and public health outcomes, in addition to <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=207></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>207</b>  <br/>
more longstanding findings around reductions in utilization and costs. Electronic patient event <br/>
notifications from hospitals, or clinical event notifications, are one type of health information <br/>
exchange intervention that has been increasingly recognized as an effective and scalable tool for <br/>
improving care coordination across settings, especially for patients at discharge. This approach <br/>
has been identified with a reduction in readmissions following implementation.<a href="CMSs.html#207">75</a>  <br/>
These notifications are automated, electronic communications from the provider to <br/>
another facility or another community provider identified by the patient. These automated <br/>
communications alert the receiving provider that the patient has received care at a different <br/>
setting. Information included with these notifications can range from simply conveying the <br/>
patient’s name, basic demographic information, and the sending institution, to a richer set of <br/>
clinical data depending upon the level of technical implementation. However, regardless of the <br/>
information included these alerts can help ensure that a receiving provider is aware that the <br/>
patient has received care elsewhere. The notification triggers a receiving provider to reach out to <br/>
the patient to deliver appropriate follow-up care in a timely manner. By providing timely <br/>
notifications, the alert may improve post-discharge transitions and reduce the likelihood of <br/>
complications resulting from inadequate follow-up care.  <br/>
Virtually all EHR systems generate the basic messages commonly used to support <br/>
electronic patient event notifications.  We believe that care coordination can have a significant <br/>
positive impact on the quality of life, consumer experience, and health outcomes for patients. <br/>
However, we acknowledge that though such activities can have positive impact, they will likely <br/>
generate some costs. We believe it is difficult to quantify the impact of this proposed change <br/>
because EHR implementation across care settings varies in maturity rates, leading to potential <br/>

variance in cost and impact across such settings. We believe that this proposal would impose <br/>
minimal additional costs on hospitals. The cost of implementing these proposed changes would <br/>
largely be limited to the one-time cost related initial implementation of the notification system, <br/>
and to the revision of a policies and procedures as they relate to discharge planning. There also <br/>
may be some minimal cost associated with communicating these changes to affected staff. <br/>
However, we believe that these costs would be offset by the benefits derived from positive <br/>
outcomes in health care quality and public health outcomes. Therefore, while this proposal <br/>
would impose a minimal burden on hospitals, we believe that, in sum, the changes proposed <br/>
would greatly benefit patients overall. <br/>
4.  Effects of Other Proposed Policy Changes <br/>
In addition to those proposed policy changes discussed previously that we are able to <br/>
model, we are proposing to make various other changes in this proposed rule. Generally, we have <br/>
limited or no specific data available with which to estimate the impacts of these proposed <br/>
changes. Our estimates of the likely impacts associated with these other proposed changes are <br/>
discussed in this section. <br/>
a.  Care Coordination Across Payers <br/>
In section V. of this proposed rule, we are proposing a new requirement for MA plans, <br/>
Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs to require <br/>
these plans to maintain a process to exchange, at a minimum, the USCDI data set upon an <br/>
enrollee’s request. Under our proposal, each of these plans subject to the requirement would, <br/>
upon an enrollee’s request:  (1) accept the data set from another plan that had covered the <br/>
enrollee within the previous 5 years; (2) send the data set at any time during an enrollee’s <br/>
enrollment and up to 5 years later, to another plan that currently covers the enrollee; and (3) send <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=209></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>209</b>  <br/>
the data set at any time during enrollment or up to 5 years after enrollment has ended to a <br/>
recipient identified by the enrollee.  <br/>
Such transactions would be made in compliance with applicable laws.  <br/>
We believe that sending and receiving this minimum data would help both plan enrollees <br/>
and health care providers in coordinating care and reducing administrative burden. We believe <br/>
that this entails utilizing all tools available to us to ensure that plans provide coordinated high-<br/>
quality care in an efficient and cost-effective way that protects program integrity. <br/>
We believe that this proposal would impose minimal additional costs on plans. We note <br/>
that we do not specify a transport standard in the proposal and anticipate that plans may opt to <br/>
use APIs, such as the API that this proposed rule would also require. We also anticipate that <br/>
plans may choose to utilize a regional health information exchange. We believe it is difficult to <br/>
quantify the impact of this proposed change because plans will likely implement different <br/>
transport methods, and we cannot predict the selected method plans will choose.   <br/>
b.  Care Coordination Through Trusted Exchange Networks <br/>
In section VI. of this proposed rule, we are proposing to require MA plans, Medicaid <br/>
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities and QHP issuers in FFEs to participate in trust <br/>
networks in order to improve interoperability in these programs. We believe that payers and <br/>
patients’ ability to communicate between themselves and with health care providers could <br/>
considerably improve patient access to data, reduce provider burden, and reduce redundant and <br/>
unnecessary procedures. A trusted exchange framework allows for the secure exchange of <br/>
electronic health information with, and use of electronic health information from, other health IT <br/>
without special effort on the part of the user. Widespread payer participation in such a <br/>
framework might also allow for more complete access, exchange, and use of all electronically <br/>
accessible health information for authorized use under applicable state or federal law.  Under our <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=210></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>210</b>  <br/>
proposal, participation would be required in a trusted exchange framework that meets the <br/>
following criteria:  <br/>
●  The trusted exchange network must be able to exchange PHI, defined in 45 CFR <br/>
160.103, in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws across jurisdictions.  <br/>
●  The trusted exchange network must connect both inpatient EHRs and ambulatory <br/>
EHRs.  <br/>
●  The trusted exchange network must support secure messaging or electronic querying <br/>
by and between patients, providers and payers. <br/>
We believe that this proposal would impose minimal additional costs on plans. <br/>
D.   Alternatives Considered <br/>
This proposed rule contains a range of proposed and potential future policies. It provides <br/>
descriptions of the statutory provisions that are addressed, identifies the proposed policies, and <br/>
presents rationales for our decisions and, where relevant, alternatives that were considered. We <br/>
carefully considered the alternatives to this proposed rule but concluded that none would <br/>
adequately and immediately begin to address the critical issue of the lack of patient access and <br/>
interoperability, or exchange of health care data within the health care system.  <br/>
The critical policy decision was how broadly or narrowly to classify the standards <br/>
required to implement interoperability. Overly prescriptive standards may stifle innovation and, <br/>
in turn, increase costs. On the other side, broad language surrounding standards risked leaving <br/>
too much open to interpretation and continuing the uncertainty about which standards would be <br/>
the most practical and cost-effective to implement. We determined it was most appropriate to <br/>
propose a technical and standards framework that strikes a balance between these two ends of the <br/>
spectrum, and to establish that we expect the standards framework to expand and mature as <br/>
interoperability increases.  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=211></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>211</b>  <br/>
A second decision was how broadly or narrowly to apply the proposed policies and <br/>
requirements. For example, alternatives to requiring health plans to provide claims data to <br/>
patients via an open API could have been altered in a number of ways, such as requiring more or <br/>
less information to be provided to patients or, simultaneously, to require additional information <br/>
beyond that already accessible through existing APIs be provided to patients by providers. <br/>
Ultimately, we opted to continue to consider most matters pertaining to providers in separate <br/>
RFIs, such as that in the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule seeking information about program <br/>
participation conditions and requirements, and to maintain the policies proposed in this rule as <br/>
policies that will further enhance and secure the foundation of future interoperability, including <br/>
through inclusion of payers, through care coordination, and through matters of security and <br/>
identity confirmation.  <br/>
As we recognize that advancing interoperability is no small or simple matter, we continue <br/>
to explore alternatives and potential other policies. We have requested comment for <br/>
consideration in future rulemaking or subregulatory guidance on a number of alternatives related <br/>
to whether additional policies or requirements, beyond those proposed herein, should be imposed <br/>
to promote interoperability. For example, the Innovation Center is seeking comment on general <br/>
principles around promoting interoperability within Innovation Center models for integration <br/>
into new models as part of the design and testing of innovative payment and service delivery <br/>
models. Additionally, we are seeking comment on how we may leverage our program authority <br/>
to provide support to those working on improving patient matching. For example, we are <br/>
requesting comment on whether CMS should require, in Medicare FFS, the MA program, <br/>
Medicaid FFS, CHIP FFS, Medicaid managed care programs, CHIP managed care entities, and <br/>
the FFEs, use of a particular patient matching software solution with a proven success rate of a <br/>
certain percentage validated by HHS or a 3rd party. We also continue to consider feedback <br/>

received from RFIs issued in various rules over the course of the past year and to incorporate <br/>
those suggestions into our strategy. <br/>
E.  Accounting Statement and Table  <br/>
In accordance with OMB Circular A– 4, Tables 9-1 and 9-2 depict an accounting <br/>

regulatory action. <br/>

The preceding discussion was an actual cost impact (not a transfer) since goods and <br/>
computer services are being paid for. Plans have the option of transferring their expenses to <br/>
enrollees. In practice, because of market competitive forces a plan may decide to operate at a <br/>
(partial) loss and not transfer the entire cost. It is important to estimate the maximum the transfer <br/>
could be. Some costs are transferred to the States (for Medicaid and CHIP) and ultimately to the <br/>
federal government (for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP), mitigating the amount transferred to <br/>

<b>213</b>  <br/>
enrollees. One approach to estimate impact on enrollees was made in section XVI.B. of this RIA. <br/>
However, this analysis did not take into account transfers.  <br/>
We now re-estimate the potential full transfer. As noted in section Tables 4 through 8 of <br/>
XVI.B. of this RIA, we have in 2021 through 2024 under a dollar increase in premium as the <br/>
worst case scenario, and we used actual costs per year. In this alternate analysis we use actual <br/>
amounts for each of 2021 through 2024 with the initial 1-year cost amortized over 5 years.  In <br/>
other words, we assume a cost of $110 (275.4/5 + 54.7) <br/>
We point out that this premium increase should be counterbalanced by projected savings <br/>
arising from the provisions in this proposed rule. More specifically, we expect the availability of <br/>
portable electronic transfer of medical data proposed by this rule to increase prevention of future <br/>
medical illnesses due to better data accessibility. The savings from avoiding one illness or one <br/>
cheaper procedure would offset the under one-dollar impact. However, we have no way, at this <br/>
point, of estimating this aspect of the future savings of the rule. <br/>
We present two estimates. First, we estimate using the enrollment figures used in Table 7 <br/>
of this RIA. Table 7 shows that we have 169 million (76+73+20) in programs that will be <br/>
spending about $110 million per year. Ignoring Federal subsidies, and assuming that all costs <br/>
will be passed on to enrollees (which is contrary to our experience), the 169 million enrollees <br/>
would each incur an extra 65 cents (110/169) a year to achieve the $110 million goal. We next <br/>
estimate using premium versus enrollment as was done in section XVI.B. of this RIA. <br/>
Prior to discussing potential transfers to enrollees, we discuss how this proposed rule may <br/>
affect commercial enrollees not in the MA, Medicaid, CHIP, or FFE programs.   Technically, <br/>
plans are only required to provide interoperability for enrollees in the MA, Medicaid, CHIP, and <br/>
FFE programs. However, it is both possible and likely, that a Parent Organization providing <br/>
interoperability for its FFE and other program enrollees as required, may choose to offer this to <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=214></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>214</b>  <br/>
commercial enrollees. Consequently, it is possible that to cover the cost of offering <br/>
interoperability to commercial enrollees outside the MA, Medicaid, CHIP and FFE programs, the <br/>
Parent Organizations, raise premiums to both their commercial enrollees as well as the MA, <br/>
Medicaid, CHIP or FFE enrollees. Thus it is possible (and we argue likely) that this proposed <br/>
rule will affect commercial enrollees even though there is no requirement to provide them <br/>
interoperability. Therefore, we believe we are obligated in this RIA to calculate the cost impact <br/>
per enrollee should the Parent Organizations offer interoperability (and should they pass on the <br/>
cost of interoperability in terms of commercial premium). The rest of the discussion below <br/>
explores this possibility.<a href="CMSs.html#214">76</a> <br/>
Commercial<b>:</b> Rebates are required under section 2718(b)(1)(A) of the PHSA and the <br/>
implementing regulations at 45 CFR part 158 when an issuer does not meet the applicable <br/>
threshold. The commercial market MLR is generally calculated as the percent of each dollar of <br/>
after-tax premium revenue spent by the issuer on medical products and services, and activities <br/>
that improve the quality of health care. If the issuer MLR for a state market is below the <br/>
applicable threshold, then the issuer must return the difference to policyholders. It follows, that if <br/>
interoperability costs raise plan costs, and if additionally, the issuers pass on the full cost in the <br/>
form of premium and/or are able to treat these costs as QIAs, then premiums and rebates will <br/>
                                                           <br/>
76 Note that our analysis in Tables 5,6,7,8 also assume that costs are incurred by commercial enrollees even though <br/>there is no requirement to provide them with interoperability. We believe this the most likely scenario. However, if <br/>we are restrictive in our impact analysis and only assume MA, Medicaid, CHIP and FFE enrollees are bearing the <br/>cost the results of Tables 5-8 would not change the negligibility conclusion as the following justifications show:  We <br/>have assumed 20 million, 73 million and 76 million enrollees in the MA, Medicaid and Commercial programs <br/>(Table 7). The 20 million and 73 million remain accurate. The 76 million (commercial enrollees) must be replaced <br/>by FFE enrollees. For this purpose we use QHP data. Based on internal data (some of which has not yet been <br/>published), for 2017 there were 9,757,747 enrollees with $55,109,210,072 total premium resulting in a $5600 per <br/>enrollee per year cost, and for 2018, there were 9,925,382 enrollees with $70,738,585,845 total premium resulting in <br/>a $7100 per enrollee per year cost. To illustrate how this changes the Table 7 impact,  the $2.10 per enrollee per year <br/>cost for 2020 commercial must be replaced by $15.96 to account for a division by 10 million versus 76 million. <br/>Although this is a big increase, $15.96 is still only about one third a percent of the per-enrollee-per-year costs of the <br/>FFE. Thus the cost is still negligible. Furthermore, a Parent Organization actuary reviewing these numbers would <br/>probably seriously recommend that all enrollees including commercial be offered the interoperability since that <br/>significantly reduces the per enrollee per year cost.   <br/>
<hr/>

<b>215</b>  <br/>
change. The following two highly simplified examples are illustrative. <br/>
Suppose the MLR threshold is 85 percent (in practice it can vary by state market), but the <br/>
issuer’s MLR is below the threshold at 75 percent. Then the issuer would have to return the 10 <br/>
percent as a rebate.  If the interoperability costs for an issuer are on average 6 percent of <br/>
premium and the issuer treats these expenses as QIA, the issuer will now have to rebate only 4 <br/>
percent instead of 10 percent (that is, the issuer’s MLR would be 81 percent rather than 75 <br/>
percent). Similarly, if both the applicable threshold and issuer MLR are 85 percent, then the <br/>
issuer would not owe a rebate.  <br/>
There are two effects of recognizing these costs as QIA: (1) for issuers below the <br/>
applicable MLR threshold, the rebate from issuers to policyholders would go down by some <br/>
amount between $0 and the interoperability cost; and (2) for issuers at or above the MLR <br/>
standards, the premium transfers from enrollees to issuers will go up by some amount between <br/>
$0 and the interoperability cost.    <br/>
To estimate these amounts, we used the public use 2016 MLR files on the CMS website <br/>
that were used for Tables 4 through 7 of this RIA.   The total 2016 premium revenue on the <br/>
commercial side was approximately $370 billion. Of the $370 billion, the total 2016 premium <br/>
revenue of issuers that were below the commercial MLR standard (80 or 85 percent, depending <br/>
on the market) was approximately $19.4 billion and that subset of issuers paid a total of $455 <br/>
million in rebates.   <br/>
As mentioned earlier, to proceed further we use the estimates of the interoperability costs <br/>
which are $110 million per year. This cost is for all parent organizations with each parent <br/>
organization possibly dealing with up to four lines of business subject to MLR requirements:  <br/>
MA (including Part D sponsors); Medicaid; CHIP; and Commercial. Thus, of the $110 million <br/>
level annual cost of interoperability, we estimate $64 million (57.81 percent commercial <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=216></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>216</b>  <br/>
proportion x $110 million level annual interoperability cost) to be the cost for the commercial <br/>
market.   <br/>
In estimating the transfers to policyholders in the commercial market, we must distinguish <br/>
between the $19.4 billion of premium revenues of issuers whose MLR was below the applicable <br/>
threshold and the $350.6 billion of premium revenues ($370 billion total revenue – $19.4 billion) <br/>
of issuers whose MLR was at or above the applicable threshold. We can now calculate the <br/>
estimated aggregate transfer in the commercial market from the policyholders to the issuers <br/>
whether through premium or rebates as follows:  <br/>
●  Interoperability cost = 0.017 percent of revenue premium ($64 million cost / $370 <br/>
billion total revenue). <br/>
●  Reduced MLR rebates = $3.3 million (0.017 percent x $19.4 billion premium from <br/>
issuers below the applicable MLR threshold). <br/>
●  Increased premiums = Up to $60.0 million (0.017 percent x ($370 billion total revenue <br/>
– $19.4 billion premium from issuers below the applicable MLR threshold)). <br/>
●  Total transfer from enrollees = Up to $63.3 million ($60.0 million increased <br/>
premium+$3.3 million reduced rebate). <br/>
●  Transfer per enrollee = 83 cents ($63.3 million / 76 million commercial enrollee). <br/>
We note that the 83 cents (under a dollar per enrollee) is consistent with the results <br/>
obtained in Tables 4 through 8 (with exact raw amounts by year without amortization of a large <br/>
first year expense). These calculations are summarized in Tables 10-1 through 10-5. <br/>

 <br/> <br/>F. Regulatory Reform Analysis under EO 13771 <br/>
Executive Order 13771, titled Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, <br/>
was issued on January 30, 2017 and requires that the costs associated with significant new <br/>
regulations “shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs <br/>
associated with at least two prior regulations.” This proposed rule is considered an EO 13771 <br/>
regulatory action. We estimate that this rule generates $56.7 million in annualized costs, <br/>
discounted at 7 percent relative to year 2016, over an infinite time horizon. Details on the <br/>
estimated costs of this proposed rule can be found in the preceding analysis. <br/>
G.  Conclusion  <br/>
The analysis above, together with the preceding preamble, provides an RIA.  <br/>
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was <br/>
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. <br/>

security features such as, but not limited to, those minimally required to comply with HIPAA <br/>
privacy and security requirements in 45 CFR part 164, 42 CFR parts 2 and 3, and other <br/>
applicable law protecting privacy and security of individually identifiable data; <br/>
(3) Must use the following content and vocabulary standards for data available through <br/>
the API where applicable to the data type or data element, unless alternate standards are required <br/>
by other applicable law: <br/>
 <br/>
(i) Content and vocabulary standards adopted by the Secretary at 45 CFR 170.213 where <br/>
such are the only available standards for the data type or element;  <br/>
(ii) Content and vocabulary standards adopted by the Secretary at 45 CFR part 162 and <br/>
42 CFR 423.160 where required by law, or where such standards are the only available standards <br/>
for the data type or element; or <br/>
(iii) The content and vocabulary standards in either paragraph (c)(3)(i) or (ii) of this <br/>
section as determined appropriate for the data type or element, where a specific data type or <br/>
element may be encoded or formatted using content and vocabulary standards in either paragraph <br/>
(c)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.  <br/>
(4) May use an updated version of any standard or all standards required under <br/>
paragraphs (c)(1) or (3) of this section, where: <br/>

<a name=247></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>247</b>  <br/>
(i) Use of the updated version of the standard is required by other applicable law, or  <br/>
(ii) Use of the updated version of the standard is not prohibited under other applicable <br/>
law, provided that:  <br/>
(A) For content and vocabulary standards other than those adopted at 45 CFR 170.213, <br/>
the Secretary has not prohibited use of the updated version of a standard for purposes of this <br/>
section or 45 CFR part 170;  <br/>
(B) For standards adopted at 45 CFR 170.213 and 45 CFR 170.215, the National <br/>
Coordinator has approved the updated version for use in the ONC Health IT Certification <br/>
Program; and  <br/>
(iii) Where use of the updated version of a standard does not disrupt an end user’s ability <br/>
to access the data described in paragraph (b) of this section through the API described in <br/>
paragraph (a) of this section.  <br/>
(d) <i>Documentation requirements for APIs.</i> For each API implemented in accordance with <br/>
paragraph (a) of this section, a QHP issuer must make publicly accessible, by posting directly on <br/>
its website and/or via publicly accessible hyperlink(s), complete accompanying documentation <br/>
that contains, at a minimum: <br/>
(1) API syntax, function names, required and optional parameters supported and their <br/>
data types, return variables and their types/structures, exceptions and exception handling <br/>
methods and their returns; <br/>
(2) The software components and configurations an application must use in order to <br/>
successfully interact with the API and process its response(s); and <br/>

<b> </b><br/>
<b>248</b>  <br/>
(e) <i>Denial or discontinuation of access to the API.</i> A QHP issuer in a Federally-<br/>
facilitated Exchange may deny or discontinue any third party application’s connection to the API <br/>
required under paragraph (a) of this section if the issuer: <br/>
(1) Reasonably determines that allowing an application to connect or remain connected to <br/>
the API would present an unacceptable level of risk to the security of personally identifiable <br/>
information, including protected health information, on the QHP issuer’s systems; and <br/>
(2) Makes this determination using objective, verifiable criteria that are applied fairly and <br/>
consistently across all applications and developers through which enrollees seek to access their <br/>
electronic health information as defined at 45 CFR 171.102, including but not limited to criteria <br/>
that may rely on automated monitoring and risk mitigation tools. <br/>
(f) <i>Exchange of data between plans. </i>(1) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, QHP <br/>
issuers in a Federally-facilitated Exchange, not including SADP issuers, must maintain a process <br/>
for the electronic exchange of, at a minimum, the data classes and elements included in the <br/>
content standard adopted at 45 CFR 170.213 of this subchapter.  Information received by a QHP <br/>
issuer must be incorporated into the QHP issuer’s records about the enrollee.  At the request of <br/>
an enrollee, a QHP issuer must:  <br/>
(i) Accept such data from any other health care plan that has provided coverage to the <br/>
enrollee within the preceding 5 years; <br/>
(ii) At any time the enrollee is currently enrolled in the plan and up to 5 years after <br/>
disenrollment, send such data to any other health care plan that currently covers the enrollee; and  <br/>
(iii) At any time the enrollee is currently enrolled in the plan and up to 5 years after <br/>
disenrollment, send such data to a recipient designated by the enrollee. <br/>
(2) QHP issuers must participate in a trusted exchange network which: <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=249></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>249</b>  <br/>
(i) Is capable of exchanging protected health information, defined at 45 CFR 160.103 of <br/>
this subchapter, in compliance with all applicable State and Federal laws of relevant <br/>
jurisdictions; <br/>
(ii) Is capable of connecting to inpatient electronic health records and ambulatory <br/>
electronic health records; and <br/>
(iii) Supports secure messaging or electronic querying by and between providers, payers <br/>
and patients. <br/>
(g) <i>Enrollee resources regarding privacy and security.</i> A QHP issuer in a Federally-<br/>
facilitated Exchange must provide on its website and through other appropriate mechanisms <br/>
through which it ordinarily communicates with current and former enrollees seeking to access <br/>
their health information held by the QHP issuer, educational resources in non-technical, simple <br/>
and easy-to-understand language explaining at a minimum: <br/>
(1) General information on steps the individual may consider taking to help protect the <br/>
privacy and security of their health information, including factors to consider in selecting an <br/>
application, and understanding the security and privacy practices of any application to which <br/>
they will entrust their health information; and <br/>
(2) An overview of which types of organizations or individuals are and are not likely to <br/>
be HIPAA covered entities, the oversight responsibilities of OCR and FTC, and how to submit a <br/>
complaint to: <br/>
(i) The HHS Office for Civil Rights; and  <br/>
(ii) The Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  <br/>
(h)<i> Exception</i>.  (1) If a plan applying for QHP certification to be offered through a <br/>
Federally-facilitated Exchange believes it cannot satisfy the requirements in paragraphs (a), (b), <br/>
or (c) of this section, the issuer must include as part of its QHP application a narrative <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=250></a><b>CMS-9115-P </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>250</b>  <br/>
justification describing the reasons why the plan cannot reasonably satisfy the requirements for <br/>
the applicable plan year, the impact of non-compliance upon enrollees, the current or proposed <br/>
means of providing health information to enrollees, and solutions and a timeline to achieve <br/>
compliance with the requirements of this section. <br/>
(2) The Federally-facilitated Exchange may grant an exception to the requirements in <br/>
paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) if the Exchange determines that making such health plan available <br/>
through such Exchange is in the interests of qualified individuals and qualified employers in the <br/>
State or States in which such Exchange operates. <br/>
(i) <i>Applicability</i>. This section is applicable for plan years beginning on or after January 1, <br/>
2020. <br/>
(ii) [Reserved] <br/>
