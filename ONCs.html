<b>21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT </b><br/>
<b>Certification Program </b><br/>
<b>AGENCY:</b> Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), <br/>
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). <br/>
<b>ACTION:</b> Proposed rule. <br/>
<b>SUMMARY:</b> This proposed rule would implement certain provisions of the 21st Century Cures <br/>
Act, including conditions and maintenance of certification requirements for health information <br/>
technology (health IT) developers under the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program), <br/>
the voluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric health care providers, and reasonable <br/>
and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking. The implementation of these <br/>
provisions would advance interoperability and support the access, exchange, and use of <br/>
electronic health information. The proposed rule would also modify the 2015 Edition health IT <br/>
certification criteria and Program in additional ways to advance interoperability, enhance health <br/>
IT certification, and reduce burden and costs.  <br/>

and use of electronic health information; and address occurrences of information blocking. This <br/>
proposed rule would implement certain provisions of the Cures Act, including Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirements for health information technology (health IT) <br/>
developers, the voluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric health providers, and <br/>
reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking. In addition, the <br/>
proposed rule would implement parts of section 4006(a) of the Cures Act to support patient <br/>
access to their electronic health information (EHI), such as making a patient’s EHI more <br/>
electronically accessible through the adoption of standards and certification criteria and the <br/>
implementation of information blocking policies that support patient electronic access to their <br/>
health information at no cost. Additionally, the proposed rule would modify the 2015 Edition <br/>
health IT certification criteria and ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program) in other ways <br/>
to advance interoperability, enhance health IT certification, and reduce burden and costs.  <br/>
In addition to fulfilling the Cures Act’s requirements, the proposed rule would contribute <br/>
to fulfilling Executive Order (EO) 13813. The President issued EO 13813 on October 12, 2017, <br/>
to promote health care choice and competition across the United States. Section 1(c) of the EO, <br/>
in relevant part, states that government rules affecting the United States health care system <br/>
should re-inject competition into the health care markets by lowering barriers to entry and <br/>
preventing abuses of market power. Section 1(c) also states that government rules should <br/>
improve access to and the quality of information that Americans need to make informed health <br/>
care decisions. For example, as mentioned above, the proposed rule focuses on establishing <br/>
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for several interoperability purposes, including <br/>
patient access to their health information without special effort. The API approach also supports <br/>

health care providers having the sole authority and autonomy to unilaterally permit connections <br/>
to their health IT through certified API technology the health care providers have acquired. In <br/>
addition, the proposed rule provides ONC’s interpretation of the information blocking definition <br/>
as established in the Cures Act and the application of the information blocking provision by <br/>
identifying reasonable and necessary activities that would not constitute information blocking. <br/>
Many of these activities focus on improving patient and health care provider access to electronic <br/>
health information and promoting competition.  <br/>
<i>B. Summary of Major Provisions and Clarifications </i><br/>
1. Deregulatory Actions for Previous Rulemakings <br/>
Since the inception of the Program, we have aimed to implement and administer the <br/>
Program in the least burdensome manner that supports our policy goals. Throughout the years, <br/>
we have worked to improve the Program with a focus on ways to reduce burden, offer flexibility <br/>
to both developers and providers, and support innovation. This approach has been consistent <br/>
with the principles of Executive Order 13563 on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review <br/>
(February 2, 2011), which instructs agencies to “determine whether any [agency] regulations <br/>
should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to make the agency’s regulatory <br/>
program more effective or less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.” To that end, <br/>
we have historically, where feasible and appropriate, taken measures to reduce burden within the <br/>
Program and make the Program more effective, flexible, and streamlined.  <br/>
ONC has reviewed and evaluated existing regulations to identify ways to administratively <br/>
reduce burden and implement deregulatory actions through guidance. In this proposed rule, we <br/>
also propose potential new deregulatory actions that will reduce burden for health IT developers, <br/>

providers, and other stakeholders. We propose six deregulatory actions in section III.B: (1) <br/>
removal of a threshold requirement related to randomized surveillance which allows ONC-<br/>
Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs) more flexibility to identify the right approach for <br/>
surveillance actions, (2) removal of the 2014 Edition from the Code of Federal Regulations <br/>
(CFR), (3) removal of the ONC-Approved Accreditor (ONC-AA) from the Program, (4) removal <br/>
of certain 2015 Edition certification criteria, (5) removal of certain Program requirements, and <br/>
(6) recognition of relevant Food and Drug Administration certification processes with a request <br/>
for comment on the potential development of new processes for the Program. <br/>
2. Updates to the 2015 Edition Certification Criteria <br/>
This rule proposes to update the 2015 Edition by not only proposing criteria for removal, <br/>
but by proposing to revise and add new certification criteria that would establish the capabilities <br/>
and related standards and implementation specifications for the certification of health IT.  <br/>
a. Adoption of the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) as a <br/>
Standard <br/>
As part of ONC’s continued efforts to assure the availability of a minimum baseline of <br/>
data classes that could be commonly available for interoperable exchange, we adopted the 2015 <br/>
Edition “Common Clinical Data Set” (CCDS) definition and used the CCDS shorthand in several <br/>
certification criteria. However, the CCDS definition also began to be colloquially used for many <br/>
different purposes. As the CCDS definition’s relevance grew outside of its regulatory context, it <br/>
became a symbolic and practical limit to the industry’s collective interests to go beyond the <br/>
CCDS data for access, exchange, and use. In addition, as we move further towards value-based <br/>
care, the need for the inclusion of additional data classes that go beyond clinical data is <br/>

necessary. In order to advance interoperability, we propose to remove the CCDS definition and <br/>
its references from the 2015 Edition and replace it with the “United States Core Data for <br/>
Interoperability.” We propose to adopt the USCDI as a standard, naming USCDI Version 1 <br/>
(USCDI v1) in § 170.213 and incorporating it by reference in § 170.299. The USCDI standard, if <br/>
adopted, would establish a set of data classes and constituent data elements that would be <br/>
required to be exchanged in support of interoperability nationwide. To achieve the goals set forth <br/>
in the Cures Act, ONC intends to establish and follow a predictable, transparent, and <br/>
collaborative process to expand the USCDI, including providing stakeholders with the <br/>
opportunity to comment on the USCDI’s expansion. Once the USCDI is adopted in regulation <br/>
naming USCDI v1, health IT developers would be allowed to take advantage of a flexibility <br/>
under the Maintenance of Certification real world testing requirements, which we refer to as the <br/>
“Standards Version Advancement Process” (described in section VII.B.5 of this proposed rule). <br/>
The Standards Version Advancement Process would permit health IT developers to voluntarily <br/>
implement and use a new version of an adopted standard, such as the USCDI, so long as the <br/>
newer version was approved by the National Coordinator through the Standards Version <br/>
Advancement Process for use in certification.       <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
b. Electronic Prescribing <br/>
We propose to update the electronic prescribing (e-Rx) SCRIPT standard in 45 CFR <br/>
170.205(b) to NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071, which would result in a new e-Rx standard eventually <br/>
becoming the baseline for certification. We also propose to adopt a new certification criterion in <br/>
§ 170.315(b)(11) for e-Rx to reflect these updated proposals. ONC and CMS have historically <br/>
maintained complementary policies of maintaining aligned e-Rx and medical history (MH) <br/>

standards to ensure that the current standard for certification to the electronic prescribing <br/>
criterion permits use of the current Part D e-Rx and MH standards. This proposal is made to <br/>
ensure such alignment as CMS recently finalized its Part D standards to NCPDP SCRIPT <br/>
2017071 for e-RX and MH, effective January 1, 2020 (83 FR 16440). In addition to continuing <br/>
to reference the current transactions included in § 170.315(b)(3), in keeping with CMS' final <br/>
rule, we also propose to  require all of the  NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard transactions CMS <br/>
adopted at 42 CFR 423.160(b)(2)(iv).  <br/>
c. Clinical Quality Measures – Report <br/>
We propose to remove the HL7 Quality Reporting Document Architecture (QRDA) <br/>
standard requirements from the 2015 Edition “CQMs – report” criterion in § 170.315(c)(3) and, <br/>
in their place, require Health IT Modules to support the CMS QRDA Implementation Guide <br/>
(IGs).<a href="ONCs.html#13">1</a> This would reduce the burden for health IT developers by only having to support one <br/>
form of the QRDA standard rather than two forms (i.e., the HL7 and CMS forms).  <br/>
d. Electronic Health Information Export <br/>
We propose a new 2015 Edition certification criterion for “electronic health information <br/>
(EHI) export” in §<b> </b>170.315(b)(10), which would replace the 2015 Edition “data export” <br/>
certification criterion (§<b> </b>170.315(b)(6)) and become part of the 2015 Edition Base EHR <br/>
definition. The proposed criterion supports situations in which we believe that all EHI produced <br/>
and electronically managed by a developer’s health IT should be made readily available for <br/>
export as a standard capability of certified health IT. Specifically, this criterion would: (1) enable <br/>
the export of EHI for a single patient upon a valid request from that patient or a user on the <br/>
                                                 <br/>

 <br/>
patient’s behalf, and (2) support the export of EHI when a health care provider chooses to <br/>
transition or migrate information to another health IT system. This criterion would also require <br/>
that the export include the data format, made publicly available, to facilitate the receiving health <br/>
IT system’s interpretation and use of the EHI to the extent reasonably practicable using the <br/>
developer’s existing technology.  <br/>
This criterion provides developers with the ability to create innovative export capabilities <br/>
according to their systems and data practices. We do not propose that the export must be <br/>
executed according to any particular standard, but propose to require that the export must be <br/>
accompanied by the data format, including its structure and syntax, to facilitate interpretation of <br/>
the EHI therein. Overall, this new criterion is intended to provide patients and health IT users, <br/>
including providers, a means to efficiently export the entire electronic health record for a single <br/>
patient or all patients in a computable, electronic format. <br/>
e. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)  <br/>
We propose to adopt a new API criterion in § 170.315(g)(10), which would replace the <br/>
“application access – data category request” certification criterion (§ 170.315(g)(8)) and become <br/>
part of the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition. This new “standardized API for patient and <br/>
population services” certification criterion would require the use of Health Level 7 (HL7®) Fast <br/>
Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standards<a href="ONCs.html#14">2 </a>and several implementation <br/>
specifications. The new criterion would focus on supporting two types of API-enabled services: <br/>
(1) services for which a single patient’s data is the focus and (2) services for which multiple <br/>
patients’ data are the focus. <br/>

 <br/>
f. Privacy and Security Transparency Attestations  <br/>
We propose to adopt two new privacy and security transparency attestation certification <br/>
criteria, which would identify whether certified health IT supports encrypting authentication <br/>
credentials and/or multi-factor authentication. In order to be issued a certification, we propose to <br/>
require that a Health IT Module developer attest to whether the Health IT Module encrypts <br/>
authentication credentials and whether the Health IT Module supports multi-factor <br/>
authentication. These criteria are not expected to place additional burden on health IT developers <br/>
since they do not require net new development or implementation to take place in order to be <br/>
met. However, certification to these proposed criteria would provide increased transparency and <br/>
potentially motivate health IT developers to encrypt authentication credentials and support multi-<br/>
factor authentication, which could help prevent exposure to unauthorized persons/entities.  <br/>
 <br/>
g. Data Segmentation for Privacy and Consent Management <br/>
In the 2015 Edition, we adopted two “data segmentation for privacy” (DS4P) certification <br/>
criteria, one for creating a summary record according to the DS4P standard and one for receiving <br/>
a summary record according to the DS4P standard. Certification to the 2015 Edition DS4P <br/>
criteria focus on data segmentation only at the document level. As noted in the 2015 Edition final <br/>
rule (80 FR 62646) – and to our knowledge still an accurate assessment – certification to these <br/>
criteria is currently not required to meet the Certified EHR Technology definition (CEHRT) or <br/>
required by any other HHS program. Since the 2015 Edition final rule, the health care industry <br/>
has engaged in additional field testing and implementation of the DS4P standard. In addition, <br/>
stakeholders shared with ONC – through public forums, listening sessions, and correspondence – <br/>
that focusing certification on segmentation to only the document level does not permit providers <br/>

the flexibility to address more granular segmentation needs. Therefore, we propose to remove the <br/>
current 2015 Edition DS4P criteria. We propose to replace these two criteria with three new 2015 <br/>
Edition “DS4P” certification criteria (two for C-CDA and one for a FHIR-based API) that would <br/>
support a more granular approach to privacy tagging data consent management for health <br/>
information exchange supported by either the C-CDA- or FHIR-based exchange standards. <br/>
3. Modifications to the ONC Health IT Certification Program <br/>
We propose to make corrections to the 2015 Edition privacy and security certification <br/>
framework (80 FR 62705) and relevant regulatory provisions. These corrections have already <br/>
been incorporated in the relevant Certification Companion Guides (CCGs).  <br/>
We propose new and revised principles of proper conduct (PoPC) for ONC-Authorized <br/>
Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs). We propose to clarify that the records retention provision <br/>
includes the “life of the edition” as well as after the retirement of an edition related to the <br/>
certification of Complete EHRs and Health IT Modules. We also propose to revise the PoPC in § <br/>
170.523(h) to clarify the basis for certification, including to permit a certification decision to be <br/>
based on an evaluation conducted by the ONC-ACB for Health IT Modules’ compliance with <br/>
certification criteria by use of conformity methods approved by the National Coordinator for <br/>
Health Information Technology (National Coordinator). We also propose to update § 170.523(h) <br/>
to require ONC-ACBs to accept test results from any ONC-ATL that is in good standing under <br/>
the Program and is compliant with its ISO 17025 accreditation requirements. We believe these <br/>
proposed new and revised PoPCs would provide necessary clarifications for ONC-ACBs and <br/>
would promote stability among the ONC-ACBs. We also propose to update § 170.523(k) to <br/>
broaden the requirements beyond just the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record <br/>

4. Health IT for the Care Continuum <br/>
Section 4001(b) of the Cures Act includes two provisions related to supporting health IT <br/>
across the care continuum.  The first instructs the National Coordinator to encourage, keep or <br/>
recognize through existing authorities, the voluntary certification of health IT for use in medical <br/>
specialties and sites of service where more technological advancement or integration is needed.  <br/>
The second outlines a provision related to the voluntary certification of health IT for use by <br/>
pediatric health providers to support the health care of children. These provisions align closely <br/>
with ONC’s core purpose to promote interoperability to support care coordination, patient <br/>
engagement, and health care quality improvement initiatives. Advancing health IT that promotes <br/>
and supports patient care when and where it is needed continues to be a primary goal of the <br/>
Program. This means health IT should support patient populations, specialized care, transitions <br/>
of care, and practice settings across the care continuum.  <br/>
ONC has explored how we might work with the health IT industry and with specialty <br/>
organizations to collaboratively develop and promote health IT that supports medical specialties <br/>
and sites of service. Over time, ONC has taken steps to make the Program modular, more open <br/>
and accessible to different types of health IT, and able to advance functionality that is generally <br/>
applicable to a variety of care and practice settings. Specific to the provisions in the Cures Act to <br/>

support providers of health care for children, we considered a wide range of factors. These <br/>
include: the evolution of health IT across the care continuum, the costs and benefits associated <br/>
with health IT, the potential regulatory burden and compliance timelines, and the need to help <br/>
advance health IT that benefits multiple medical specialties and sites of service involved in the <br/>
care of children. In consideration of these factors, and to advance implementation of Sections <br/>
4001(b) of the Cures Act specific to pediatric care, we held a listening session where <br/>
stakeholders could share their clinical knowledge and technical expertise in pediatric care and <br/>
pediatric sites of service. Through the information learned at this listening session and our <br/>
analysis of the health IT landscape for pediatric settings, we have identified existing 2015 <br/>
Edition criteria, as well as new and revised 2015 Edition criteria proposed in this rule, that we <br/>
believe could benefit providers of pediatric care and pediatric settings. In this proposed rule, we <br/>
seek comment on our analysis and the correlated certification criteria that we believe would <br/>
support the health care of children.  <br/>
We also recognize the significance of the opioid epidemic confronting our nation and the <br/>
importance of helping to support the health IT needs of health care providers committed to <br/>
preventing inappropriate access to prescription opioids and to providing safe, appropriate <br/>
treatment. We believe health IT offers promising strategies to help assist medical specialties and <br/>
sites of services impacted by the opioid epidemic. Therefore, we request public comment on how <br/>
our existing Program requirements and the proposals in this rulemaking may support use cases <br/>
related to Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) prevention and treatment and if there are additional areas <br/>
that ONC should consider for effective implementation of health IT to help address OUD <br/>
prevention and treatment. <br/>

5. Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
We propose to establish certain Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirements for health IT developers based on the conditions and maintenance of certification <br/>
requirements outlined in section 4002 of the Cures Act. We propose an approach whereby the <br/>
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification express both initial requirements for health IT <br/>
developers and their certified Health IT Module(s) as well as ongoing requirements that must be <br/>
met by both health IT developers and their certified Health IT Module(s) under the Program. In <br/>
this regard, we propose to implement the Cures Act Conditions of Certification with further <br/>
specificity as it applies to the Program and propose to implement any accompanying <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirements as standalone requirements to ensure that not only are <br/>
the Conditions of Certification met, but that they are continually being met through the <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirements. For ease of reference and to distinguish from other <br/>
conditions, we propose to capitalize “Conditions of Certification” and “Maintenance of <br/>
Certification” when referring to Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements <br/>
established under the Cures Act. <br/>
<i>Information Blocking </i><br/>
The Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification under the Program, not take any action that constitutes information blocking as <br/>
defined in section 3022(a) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). We propose to establish this <br/>
information blocking Condition of Certification in § 170.401. The Condition of Certification <br/>
would prohibit any health IT developer under the Program from taking any action that constitutes <br/>
information blocking as defined by section 3022(a) of the PHSA and proposed in § 171.103. <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
<i>Assurances </i><br/>
Section 3001(c)(5)(D)(ii) of the<b> </b>Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a <br/>
Condition of Certification under the Program, provide assurances to the Secretary that, unless for <br/>
legitimate purposes specified by the Secretary, the developer will not take any action that <br/>
constitutes information blocking as defined in section 3022(a) of the PHSA, or any other action <br/>
that may inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of EHI. We propose to implement this <br/>
provision through several Conditions of Certification and accompanying Maintenance <br/>
requirements, which are set forth in proposed § 170.402. We also propose to establish more <br/>
specific Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements to provide assurances that a <br/>
health IT developer does not take any other action that may inhibit the appropriate exchange, <br/>
access, and use of EHI. These proposed requirements serve to provide further clarity under the <br/>
Program as to how health IT developers can provide such broad assurances with more specific <br/>
actions. <br/>
<i>Communications </i><br/>
As a Condition and Maintenance of Certification under the Program, the Cures Act <br/>
requires that health IT developers do not prohibit or restrict communications about certain <br/>
aspects of the performance of health IT and the developers’ related business practices. We <br/>
propose that developers will be permitted to impose certain kinds of limited prohibitions and <br/>
restrictions that we believe strike a reasonable balance between the need to promote open <br/>
communication about health IT and related developer business practices and the need to protect <br/>
the legitimate interests of health IT developers and other entities. However, certain narrowly-<br/>
defined types of communications—such as communications required by law, made to a <br/>

government agency, or made to a defined category of safety organization—would receive <br/>
“unqualified protection,” meaning that developers would be absolutely prohibited from imposing <br/>
any prohibitions or restrictions on such protected communications.  <br/>
We propose that to maintain compliance with this Condition of Certification, a health IT <br/>
developer must not impose or enforce any contractual requirement or legal right that contravenes <br/>
this Condition of Certification. Furthermore, we propose that if a health IT developer has <br/>
contracts/agreements in existence that contravene this condition, the developer must notify all <br/>
affected customers or other persons or entities that the prohibition or restriction will not be <br/>
enforced by the health IT developer. Going forward, health IT developers would be required to <br/>
amend their contracts/agreements to remove or make void the provisions that contravene this <br/>
Condition of Certification within a reasonable period of time, but not later than two years from <br/>
the effective date of a subsequent final rule for this proposed rule.   <br/>
<i>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) </i><br/>
The Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification includes several key phrases (including, <br/>
for example, “without special effort”) and requirements for health IT developers that indicate the <br/>
Cures Act’s focus on the technical requirements as well as the actions and practices of health IT <br/>
developers in implementing the certified API. In section VII.B.4 of the preamble, we outline our <br/>
proposals to implement the Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification. These proposals include <br/>
new standards, new implementation specifications, a new certification criterion, as well as <br/>
detailed Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements.  <br/>

The Cures Act adds a new Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement that <br/>
health IT developers successfully test the real world use of the technology for interoperability in <br/>
the type of setting in which such technology would be marketed. In this proposed rule, we <br/>
outline what successful “real world testing” means for the purpose of this Condition of <br/>
Certification, as well as proposed Maintenance requirements—including standards updates for <br/>
widespread and continued interoperability.  <br/>
We propose to limit the applicability of this Condition of Certification to health IT <br/>
developers with Health IT Modules certified to one or more 2015 Edition certification criteria <br/>
focused on interoperability and data exchange specified in section VII.B.5. We propose <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirements that would require health IT developers to submit <br/>
publicly available annual real world testing plans as well as annual real world testing  results for <br/>
certified health IT products focused on interoperability. We also propose a Maintenance of <br/>
Certification flexibility we have named the Standards Version Advancement Process, under <br/>
which health IT developers with health IT certified to the criteria specified for interoperability <br/>
and data exchange would have the option to update their health IT to a more advanced version(s) <br/>
of the standard(s) or implementation specification(s) included in the criteria once such versions <br/>
are approved by the National Coordinator through the Standards Version Advancement Process <br/>
for use in health IT certified under the Program. Similarly, we propose that health IT developers <br/>
presenting new health IT for certification to one of the criteria specified in Section VII.B.5 <br/>
would have the option to certify to a National Coordinator-approved more advanced version of <br/>
the adopted standards or implementation specifications included in the criteria.  We propose that <br/>
health IT developers voluntarily opting to avail themselves of the Standards Version <br/>

rollout of standards updates in their annual real world testing plans and real world testing results <br/>
submissions. We also propose that health IT developers of products with existing certifications <br/>
who plan to avail themselves of the Standards Version Advancement Process  flexibility notify <br/>
both their ONC-ACB and their affected customers of their intention and plans to update their <br/>
certified health IT and its anticipated impact on their existing certified health IT and customers, <br/>
specifically including but not limited to whether, and if so for how long, the health IT developer <br/>
intends to continue to support the certificate for the health IT certified to the prior version of the <br/>
standard.   <br/>
We propose a new PoPC for ONC-ACBs that would require ONC-ACBs to review and <br/>
confirm that applicable health IT developers submit real world testing plans and real world <br/>
results in accordance with our proposals. Once completeness is confirmed, ONC-ACBs would <br/>
upload the plans and results via hyperlinks to the Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL). We <br/>
propose to revise the PoPC in § 170.523(m) to require ONC-ACBs to collect, no less than <br/>
quarterly, all updates successfully made to standards in certified health IT pursuant to the <br/>
developers having voluntarily opted to avail themselves of the Standards Version Advancement <br/>
Process  flexibility under the real world testing Condition of Certification. We propose in § <br/>
170.523(t), a new PoPC for ONC-ACBs requiring them to ensure that developers seeking to take <br/>

The Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification under the Program, provide to the Secretary an attestation to all the Conditions of <br/>
Certification specified in the Cures Act, except for the “EHR reporting criteria submission” <br/>
Condition of Certification. We propose to implement the Cures Act “attestations” Condition of <br/>
Certification in § 170.406. Health IT developers would attest twice a year to compliance with the <br/>
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements (except for the EHR reporting criteria <br/>
requirement, which would be metrics reporting requirements separately implemented through a <br/>
future rulemaking). The 6-month attestation period we propose in § 170.406(b)(2) would <br/>
properly balance the need to support appropriate enforcement with the attestation burden placed <br/>
on health IT developers. In this regard, the proposed rule includes provisions to make the process <br/>
as simple and efficient for health IT developers as possible (e.g., 14-day grace period, web-based <br/>
form submissions, and attestation alert reminders).  <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that attestations would be submitted to ONC-ACBs on behalf of ONC and <br/>
the Secretary. We propose a new PoPC in § 170.523(q) that an ONC-ACB must review and <br/>
submit the health IT developers’ attestations to ONC. ONC would then make the attestations <br/>
publicly available through the CHPL.  <br/>
 <br/>
<i>EHR Reporting Criteria Submission</i> <br/>
 <br/>
The Cures Act specifies that health IT developers be required, as a Condition and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification under the Program, to submit reporting criteria on certified health <br/>
IT in accordance with the EHR reporting program established under section 3009A of the PHSA, <br/>
as added by the Cures Act. We have not yet established an EHR reporting program. Once ONC <br/>

 <br/>
establishes such program, we will undertake rulemaking to propose and implement the <br/>
associated Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement(s) for health IT developers. <br/>
<i>Enforcement </i><br/>
<i> <br/></i> <br/>
Section 4002 of the Cures Act adds Program requirements aimed at addressing health IT <br/>
developer actions and business practices through the Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification requirements, which expands the current focus of the Program requirements beyond <br/>
the certified health IT itself. Equally important, section 4002 also provides that the Secretary of <br/>
HHS may encourage compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirements and take action to discourage noncompliance. We, therefore, propose a general <br/>
enforcement approach to encourage consistent compliance with the requirements. The proposed <br/>
rule outlines a corrective action process for ONC to review potential or known instances where a <br/>
Condition or Maintenance of Certification requirement has not been or is not being met by a <br/>
health IT developer under the Program. We propose, with minor modifications, to utilize the <br/>
processes previously established for ONC direct review of certified health IT and codified in §§ <br/>
170.580 and 170.581 for the enforcement of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirements. Where noncompliance is identified, our first priority would be to work with the <br/>
health IT developer to remedy the matter through a corrective action process. However, we <br/>
propose that, under certain circumstances, ONC may ban a health IT developer from the Program <br/>
or terminate the certification of one or more of its Health IT Modules.  <br/>
6. Information Blocking <br/>
Section 4004 of the Cures Act added section 3022 of the PHSA (42 U.S.C. 300jj–52, “the <br/>
information blocking provision”), which defines conduct by health care providers, and health IT <br/>

developers of certified health IT, exchanges, and networks that constitutes information blocking. <br/>
Section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA defines information blocking in broad terms, while section <br/>
3022(a)(3) authorizes and charges the Secretary to identify reasonable and necessary activities <br/>
that do not constitute information blocking (section 3022(a)(3) of the PHSA).  <br/>
 <br/>
We identify several reasonable and necessary activities as exceptions to the information <br/>
blocking definition, each of which we propose would not constitute information blocking for <br/>
purposes of section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA. The exceptions would extend to certain activities <br/>
that interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI but that may be reasonable and necessary <br/>
if certain conditions are met.  <br/>
In developing the proposed exceptions, we were guided by three overarching policy <br/>
considerations. First, the exceptions would be limited to certain activities that clearly advance the <br/>
aims of the information blocking provision; promoting public confidence in health IT <br/>
infrastructure by supporting the privacy and security of EHI, and protecting patient safety; and <br/>
promoting competition and innovation in health IT and its use to provide health care services to <br/>
consumers. Second, each exception is intended to address a significant risk that regulated <br/>
individuals and entities (i.e., health care providers, health IT developers of certified health IT, <br/>
health information networks, and health information exchanges) will not engage in these <br/>
reasonable and necessary activities because of potential uncertainty regarding whether they <br/>
would be considered information blocking. Third, and last, each exception is intended to be <br/>
tailored, through appropriate conditions, so that it is limited to the reasonable and necessary <br/>
activities that it is designed to exempt.  <br/>

The seven proposed exceptions are set forth in section VIII.D below. The first three <br/>
exceptions, set forth in VIII.D.1-D.3 address activities that are reasonable and necessary to <br/>
promote public confidence in the use of health IT and the exchange of EHI. These exceptions are <br/>
intended to protect patient safety; promote the privacy of EHI; and promote the security of EHI. <br/>
The next three exceptions, set forth in VIII.D.4-D.6, address activities that are reasonable and <br/>
necessary to promote competition and consumer welfare. These exceptions would allow for the <br/>
recovery of costs reasonably incurred; excuse an actor from responding to requests that are <br/>
infeasible; and permit the licensing of interoperability elements on reasonable and non-<br/>
discriminatory terms. The last exception, set forth in VIII.D.7, addresses activities that are <br/>
reasonable and necessary to promote the performance of health IT. This proposed exception <br/>
recognizes that actors may make health IT temporarily unavailable for maintenance or <br/>
improvements that benefit the overall performance and usability of health IT.  <br/>
 <br/>
To qualify for any of these exceptions, we propose that an individual or entity would, for <br/>
each relevant practice and at all relevant times, have to satisfy all of the applicable conditions of <br/>
the exception. Additionally, we propose (in section VIII.C of this preamble) to define or interpret <br/>
terms that are present in section 3022 of the PHSA (such as the types of individuals and entities <br/>
covered by the information blocking provision). We also propose certain new terms and <br/>
definitions that are necessary to implement the information blocking provisions. We propose to <br/>
codify the proposed exceptions and other information blocking proposals in a new part of title 45 <br/>
of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 171.  <br/>

Executive Orders 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993)  and <br/>
13563 on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (February 2, 2011) direct agencies to <br/>
assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to <br/>
select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, <br/>
environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). A regulatory <br/>
impact analysis (RIA) must be prepared for major rules with economically significant effects <br/>
($100 million or more in any one year). OMB has determined that this proposed rule is an <br/>
economically significant rule as the potential costs associated with this proposed rule could be <br/>
greater than $100 million per year. Accordingly, we have prepared an RIA that to the best of our <br/>
ability presents the costs and benefits of this proposed rule. <br/>
We have estimated the potential monetary costs and benefits of this proposed rule for <br/>
health IT developers, health care providers, patients, ONC-ACBs, ONC-ATLs, and the federal <br/>
government (i.e., ONC), and have broken those costs and benefits out into the following <br/>
categories: (1) deregulatory actions (no associated costs); (2) updates to the updates to the 2015 <br/>
Edition health IT certification criteria; (3) Conditions and Maintenance of Certification for a <br/>
health IT developer; (4) oversight for the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification; and (5) <br/>
information blocking.  <br/>
We note that we have rounded all estimates to the nearest dollar and all estimates are <br/>
expressed in 2016 dollars as it is the most recent data available to address all cost and benefit <br/>
estimates consistently. We also note that we did not have adequate data to quantify some of the <br/>
costs and benefits within this RIA. In those situations, we have described the qualitative costs <br/>

Information Technology and Quality” (Title XXX) to improve health care quality, safety, and <br/>
efficiency through the promotion of health IT and electronic health information (EHI) exchange.  <br/>
The Cures Act was enacted on December 13, 2016, to accelerate the discovery, <br/>
development, and delivery of 21st century cures, and for other purposes. The Cures Act, through <br/>
Title IV – Delivery, amended the HITECH Act (Title XIII of Division A of Pub. L. 111-5) by <br/>
modifying or adding certain provisions to the PHSA relating to health IT. <br/>
  1. Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria <br/>
 <br/>
The HITECH Act established two new federal advisory committees, the HIT Policy <br/>
Committee (HITPC) and the HIT Standards Committee (HITSC). Each was responsible for <br/>
advising the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (National Coordinator) on <br/>
different aspects of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. <br/>
Section 3002 of the Cures Act amended the PHSA by replacing the HITPC and HITSC <br/>
with one committee, the Health Information Technology Advisory Committee (HIT Advisory <br/>
Committee or HITAC). Section 3002(a) establishes that the HITAC shall advise and recommend <br/>
to the National Coordinator on different aspects of standards, implementation specifications, and <br/>
certification criteria, relating to the implementation of a health IT infrastructure, nationally and <br/>
locally, that advances the electronic access, exchange, and use of health information. Further <br/>
described in section 3002(b)(1)(A) of the PHSA, this includes providing to the National <br/>
Coordinator recommendations on a policy framework to advance interoperable health IT <br/>
infrastructure, updating recommendations to the policy framework, and making new <br/>
recommendations, as appropriate. Section 3002(b)(2)(A) identifies that in general, the HITAC <br/>
shall recommend to the National Coordinator for purposes of adoption under section 3004, <br/>

standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria and an order of priority for the <br/>
development, harmonization, and recognition of such standards, specifications, and certification <br/>
criteria. Like the process previously required of the former HITPC and HITSC, the HITAC will <br/>
develop a schedule for the assessment of policy recommendations for the Secretary to publish in <br/>
the <b>Federal Register</b>.  <br/>
  Section 3004 of the PHSA identifies a process for the adoption of health IT standards, <br/>
implementation specifications, and certification criteria and authorizes the Secretary to adopt <br/>
such standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. As specified in section <br/>
3004(a)(1), the Secretary is required, in consultation with representatives of other relevant <br/>
federal agencies, to jointly review standards, implementation specifications, and certification <br/>
criteria endorsed by the National Coordinator under section 3001(c) and subsequently determine <br/>
whether to propose the adoption of any grouping of such standards, implementation <br/>
specifications, or certification criteria. The Secretary is required to publish all determinations in <br/>
the <b>Federal Register</b>. <br/>
Section 3004(b)(3) of the PHSA titled, Subsequent Standards Activity, provides that the <br/>
Secretary shall adopt additional standards, implementation specifications, and certification <br/>
criteria as necessary and consistent with the schedule published by the HITAC. We consider this <br/>
provision in the broader context of the HITECH Act and Cures Act to grant the Secretary the <br/>
authority and discretion to adopt standards, implementation specifications, and certification <br/>
criteria that have been recommended by the HITAC and endorsed by the National Coordinator, <br/>
as well as other appropriate and necessary health IT standards, implementation specifications, <br/>
and certification criteria. <br/>

2. Health IT Certification Program(s) <br/>
Under the HITECH Act, section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA provides the National <br/>
Coordinator with the authority to establish a certification program or programs for the voluntary <br/>
certification of health IT. Specifically, section 3001(c)(5)(A) specifies that the National <br/>
Coordinator, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute of Standards and <br/>
Technology (NIST), shall keep or recognize a program or programs for the voluntary <br/>
certification of health IT that is in compliance with applicable certification criteria adopted under <br/>
this subtitle (i.e., certification criteria adopted by the Secretary under section 3004 of the PHSA). <br/>
The certification program(s) must also include, as appropriate, testing of the technology in <br/>
accordance with section 13201(b) of the HITECH Act. Overall, section 13201(b) of the HITECH <br/>
Act requires that with respect to the development of standards and implementation <br/>
specifications, the Director of NIST shall support the establishment of a conformance testing <br/>

<i>B. Regulatory History </i><br/>
The Secretary issued an interim final rule with request for comments (75 FR 2014, Jan. <br/>
13, 2010), which adopted an initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and <br/>
certification criteria. On March 10, 2010, ONC published a proposed rule (75 FR 11328) that <br/>
proposed both a temporary and permanent certification program for the purposes of testing and <br/>
certifying health IT. A final rule establishing the temporary certification program was published <br/>
on June 24, 2010 (75 FR 36158) and a final rule establishing the permanent certification program <br/>
was published on January 7, 2011 (76 FR 1262). ONC issued multiple rulemakings since these <br/>
initial rulemaking to update standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria <br/>
and the certification program, a history of which can be found in the final rule titled, “2015 <br/>
Edition Health Information (Health IT) Certification Criteria, 2015 Edition Base Electronic <br/>
Health Record (EHR) Definition, and ONC Health IT Certification Program Modifications” <br/>
(Oct. 16, 2015, 80 FR 62602) (“2015 Edition final rule”). A correction notice was published for <br/>
the 2015 Edition final rule on December 11, 2015 (80 FR 76868) to correct preamble and <br/>
regulatory text errors and clarify requirements of the Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), the <br/>
2015 Edition privacy and security certification framework, and the mandatory disclosures for <br/>
health IT developers.  <br/>

The 2015 Edition final rule established a new edition of certification criteria (“2015 <br/>
Edition health IT certification criteria” or “2015 Edition”) and a new 2015 Edition Base EHR <br/>
definition. The 2015 Edition established the capabilities and specified the related standards and <br/>
implementation specifications that CEHRT would need to include to, at a minimum, support the <br/>
achievement of “meaningful use” by eligible clinicians, eligible hospitals, and critical access <br/>
hospitals under the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs (EHR Incentive Programs) <br/>
(now referred to as the Promoting Interoperability Programs)<a href="ONCs.html#34">3</a> when the 2015 Edition is required <br/>
for use under these and other programs referencing the CEHRT definition. The 2015 Edition <br/>
final rule also made changes to the Program. The final rule adopted a proposal to change the <br/>
Program’s name to the “ONC Health IT Certification Program” from the ONC <i>HIT</i> Certification <br/>
Program, modified the Program to make it more accessible to other types of health IT beyond <br/>
EHR technology and for health IT that supports care and practice settings beyond the ambulatory <br/>
and inpatient settings, and adopted new and revised Principles of Proper Conduct (PoPC) for <br/>
ONC-ACBs.  <br/>
After issuing a proposed rule on March 2, 2016 (81 FR 11056), ONC published a final <br/>
rule titled, “ONC Health IT Certification Program: Enhanced Oversight and Accountability” (81 <br/>
FR 72404) (“EOA final rule”) on October 19, 2016. The final rule finalized modifications and <br/>
new requirements under the Program, including provisions related to ONC’s role in the Program. <br/>
The final rule created a regulatory framework for ONC’s direct review of health IT certified <br/>
under the Program, including, when necessary, requiring the correction of non-conformities <br/>
found in health IT certified under the Program and suspending and terminating certifications <br/>

<b>III. Deregulatory Actions for Previous Rulemakings </b><br/>
<i>A. Background </i><br/>
1. History of Burden Reduction and Flexibility <br/>
Since the inception of the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program), we have <br/>
aimed to implement and administer the Program in the least burdensome manner that supports <br/>
our policy goals. Throughout the years, we have worked to improve the Program with a focus on <br/>
ways to reduce burden, offer flexibility to both developers and providers, and support innovation. <br/>
This approach has been consistent with the principles of Executive Order 13563 on Improving <br/>
Regulation and Regulatory Review (February 2, 2011), which instructs agencies to “determine <br/>
whether any [agency] regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as <br/>
to make the agency’s regulatory program more effective or less burdensome in achieving the <br/>
regulatory objectives.” To that end, we have historically, where feasible and appropriate, taken <br/>
measures to reduce burden within the Program and make the Program more effective, flexible, <br/>
and streamlined.  <br/>
For example, in the 2014 Edition final rule (77 FR 54164), we revised the certified <br/>
electronic health record technology (CEHRT) definition to provide flexibility and create <br/>
regulatory efficiencies by narrowing required functionality to a core set of capabilities (i.e., the <br/>
Base EHR definition) plus the additional capabilities each eligible clinician, eligible hospital, and <br/>
critical access hospital needed to successfully achieve the applicable objective and measures <br/>

 <br/>
under the EHR Incentive Programs (now referred to as the Promoting Interoperability Programs). <br/>
ONC has also supported more efficient testing and certification methods and reduced regulatory <br/>
burden through the adoption of a gap certification policy. As explained in the 2014 Edition final <br/>
rule (77 FR 54254) and the 2015 Edition final rule (80 FR 62681), where applicable, gap <br/>
certification allows for the use of a previously certified health IT product’s test results to <br/>
certification criteria identified as unchanged. Developers have been able to use gap certification <br/>
for the more efficient certification of their health IT when updating from the 2011 Edition to the <br/>
2014 Edition and from the 2014 Edition to the 2015 Edition.  <br/>
ONC introduced further means to reduce regulatory burden, increase regulatory <br/>
flexibility, and promote innovation in the 2014 Edition Release 2 final rule <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-54430">(79 FR 54430)</a>. The <br/>
2014 Edition Release 2 final rule established a set of optional 2014 Edition certification criteria <br/>
that provided flexibility and alternative certification pathways for health IT developers and <br/>
providers based on their specific circumstances. The 2014 Edition Release 2 final rule also <br/>
simplified the Program by discontinuing the use of the “Complete EHR” certification concept <br/>
beginning with the 2015 Edition (79 FR 54443).  <br/>
In the 2015 Edition final rule, we did not “carry forward” certain 2014 Edition <br/>
certification criteria into the 2015 Edition, such as the “image results,” “patient list creation,” and <br/>
“electronic medication administration record” criteria. We determined that these criteria did not <br/>
advance functionality or support interoperability (80 FR 62682-84). We also did not require all <br/>
health IT to be certified to the “meaningful use measurement” certification criteria for <br/>
“automated numerator recording” and “automated measure calculation” (80 FR 62605), which <br/>
had been previously required for the 2014 Edition. Based on stakeholder feedback and Program <br/>

“automated numerator recording” and “automated measure calculation” criteria by removing the <br/>
live demonstration requirement of recording data and generating reports. Health IT developers <br/>
may now self-test their Health IT Modules(s) and submit the resulting reports to the ONC-<br/>
Authorized Testing Laboratory (ONC-ATL) to verify compliance with the criterion.<a href="ONCs.html#37">4</a> In order to <br/>
further reduce burden for health IT developers, we adopted a simpler, straight-forward approach <br/>
to privacy and security certification requirements, which clarified which requirements are <br/>
applicable to each criterion within the regulatory functional areas (80 FR 62605).  <br/>
2. Executive Orders 13771 and 13777 <br/>
On January 30, 2017, the President issued Executive Order 13771 on Reducing <br/>
Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which requires agencies to identify deregulatory <br/>
actions. This order was followed by Executive Order 13777, titled “Enforcing the Regulatory <br/>
Reform Agenda” (February 24, 2017). Executive Order 13777 provides further direction on <br/>
implementing regulatory reform by identifying a process by which agencies must review and <br/>
evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations for repeal or simplification.    <br/>
In order to implement these regulatory reform initiatives and policies, over the past year <br/>
ONC reviewed and evaluated existing regulations. During our review, we sought to identify <br/>
ways to further reduce administrative burden, to implement deregulatory actions through <br/>
guidance, and to propose potential new deregulatory actions in this proposed rule that will reduce <br/>
burden for health IT developer, providers, and other stakeholders.  <br/>

On August 21, 2017, ONC issued <i>Relied Upon Software Program Guidance</i>.<a href="ONCs.html#38">5</a> Health IT <br/>
developers are permitted to use “relied upon software” (76 FR 1276) to demonstrate compliance <br/>
with certification criteria adopted at 45 CFR Part 170, Subpart C. Historically, in cases where a <br/>
Health IT Module is paired with multiple “relied upon software” products for the same <br/>
capability, health IT developers were required to demonstrate compliance for the same <br/>
certification criterion with each of those “relied upon software” products in order for the <br/>
products to be listed on the Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL). With the issued guidance, <br/>
health IT developers may now demonstrate compliance with only one “relied upon software” <br/>
product for a criterion/capability. Once the health IT developer demonstrates compliance with a <br/>
minimum of one “relied upon software” product, the developer can have multiple, additional <br/>
“relied upon software” products for the same criterion/capability listed on the CHPL <br/>
(https://chpl.healthit.gov/). This approach reduces burden for health IT developers, ONC-ATLs, <br/>
and ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs).  <br/>
On September 21, 2017, ONC reduced the overall burden for testing health IT to the <br/>
2015 Edition.<a href="ONCs.html#38">6 </a>ONC reviewed the 2015 Edition test procedures, which identify minimum testing <br/>
requirements ONC-ATLs must evaluate during testing. ONC changed 30 of the 2015 Edition test <br/>
procedures to attestation only (i.e., a “yes” self-declaration by the health IT developer that their <br/>
product has capabilities conformant with those specified in the associated certification <br/>
criterion/criteria).<a href="ONCs.html#38">7</a> This deregulatory action reduced burden and costs program-wide, while still <br/>
maintaining the Program’s high level of integrity and assurances. Health IT developers now have <br/>

 <br/>
reduced preparation and testing costs for testing to these criteria. Specifically, the cost savings <br/>
for health IT developers have been estimated between $8.34 and $9.26 million. ONC-ATLs also <br/>
benefit by having more time and resources to focus on tool-based testing (for interoperability-<br/>
oriented criteria) and being responsive to any retesting requirements that may arise from ONC-<br/>
ACB surveillance activities. Furthermore, providers and users of certified health IT do not lose <br/>
confidence in the Program because this burden reduction effort in no way alters the expectations <br/>
of conformance and responsibilities of Program participants. Health IT developers are still <br/>
required to meet certification criteria requirements and maintain their products’ conformance to <br/>
the full scope of the associated criteria, including when implemented in the field and in <br/>
production use. Similarly, ONC and ONC-ACBs continue to conduct surveillance activities and <br/>
respond to end-user complaints. <br/>
<i>B. Proposed Deregulatory Actions </i><br/>
<i> </i><br/>
We propose six deregulatory actions below. We welcome comments on these potential <br/>
deregulatory actions and any other potential deregulatory actions we should consider. We also <br/>
refer readers to section XIV (Regulatory Impact Analysis) of this proposed rule for a discussion <br/>
of the estimated cost savings from these proposed deregulatory actions. <br/>
 <br/>
1. Removal of Randomized Surveillance Requirements <br/>
ONC-ACBs are required to conduct surveillance of certified health IT under the Program <br/>
to ensure that health IT continues to conform and function as required by the full scope of the <br/>
certification requirements. Surveillance is categorized as either reactive surveillance (for <br/>
example, complaint-based surveillance) or randomized surveillance, which, by regulation, <br/>
requires ONC-ACBs to proactively surveil 2% of the certificates they issue annually. On <br/>

September 21, 2017, we exercised enforcement discretion with respect to the implementation of <br/>
randomized surveillance by ONC-ACBs.<a href="ONCs.html#40">8 </a>Consistent with this exercise of enforcement <br/>
discretion, we now propose to eliminate certain regulatory randomized surveillance <br/>
requirements. <br/>
We propose to revise § 170.556(c) by changing the requirement that ONC-ACBs <i>must</i> <br/>
conduct in-the-field, randomized surveillance to specify that ONC-ACBs <i>may</i> conduct in-the-<br/>
field, randomized surveillance. We further propose to remove § 170.556(c)(2), which specifies <br/>
that ONC-ACBs must conduct randomized surveillance for a minimum of 2% of certified health <br/>
IT products per year. We also propose to remove the requirements in § 170.556(c)(5) regarding <br/>
the exclusion and exhaustion of selected locations for randomized surveillance. Additionally, we <br/>
propose to remove the requirements in § 170.556(c)(6) regarding the consecutive selection of <br/>
certified health IT for randomized surveillance. Without these regulatory requirements, ONC-<br/>
ACBs would still be required to perform reactive surveillance, and would be permitted to <br/>
conduct randomized surveillance of their own accord, using the methodology identified by ONC <br/>
with respect to scope (§ 170.556(c)(1)), selection method (§ 170.556(c)(3)), and the number and <br/>
types of locations for in-the-field surveillance (§ 170.556(c)(4)).   <br/>
 <br/>
Stakeholders have expressed concern that the benefits of in-the-field, randomized <br/>
surveillance may not outweigh the time commitment required by providers, particularly if no <br/>
non-conformities are found. In general, providers have expressed that reactive surveillance (e.g., <br/>
surveillance based on user complaints) is a more logical and economical approach to <br/>

surveillance. The removal of randomized surveillance requirements would also give ONC-ACBs <br/>
the flexibility and time to focus on other priorities, such as the certification of health IT to the <br/>
2015 Edition. Therefore, as discussed above, we propose to eliminate certain regulatory <br/>
randomized surveillance requirements. <br/>
 <br/>
2. Removal of the 2014 Edition from the Code of Federal Regulations <br/>
We propose to remove the 2014 Edition from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). <br/>
The 2014 Edition was the result of rulemaking completed in 2012 and includes standards and <br/>
functionality that are now significantly outmoded. Removal of the 2014 Edition would make the <br/>
2015 Edition the baseline for health IT certification. The 2015 Edition, including the additional <br/>
certification criteria, standards, and requirements proposed in this proposed rule, better enables <br/>
interoperability and the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information. Adoption and <br/>
implementation of the 2015 Edition, including the proposals in this proposed rule, would also <br/>
lead to the benefits outlined in the 2015 Edition final rule (80 FR 62602-62603, 62605-62606, <br/>
62740) and in this proposed rule (<i>see, for example,</i> the Executive Summary and the <br/>
“Assurances,” “API”, and “Real World Testing” Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
sections). Equally important, adoption and implementation of the 2015 Edition by providers <br/>
would lead to the estimated costs savings in this proposed rule through improved interoperability <br/>
supporting the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information.  <br/>
Removal of the 2014 Edition would eliminate inconsistencies and costs caused by health <br/>
IT certification and implementation of two different editions with different functionalities and <br/>
versions of standards. Patient care could improve through the reduced risk of error that comes <br/>
with the health care system’s consistent implementation and use of health IT certified to the 2015 <br/>

Edition. Innovation could also improve with health IT developers (including third-party software <br/>
developers) developing to only one set of newer standards and implementation specifications, <br/>
which would be more predictable and less costly.  <br/>
Removal of the 2014 Edition would also reduce regulatory burden by no longer requiring <br/>
the maintenance and support of the 2014 Edition. Maintaining compliance with only the 2015 <br/>
Edition would reduce the cost and burden for health IT developers, ONC-ACBs, and ONC-ATLs <br/>
because they would no longer have to support two increasingly distinct sets of requirements as is <br/>
the case now with certification to both the 2014 and 2015 Editions. More specifically, health IT <br/>
developers would not have to support two maintenance infrastructures and updating for their <br/>
customers; nor would ONC-ATLs and ONC-ACBs have to support testing, certification, and <br/>
surveillance for two separate editions of certified health IT.  <br/>
As referenced by the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Centers for Medicare &amp; <br/>
Medicaid Services (CMS) in their rulemakings regarding donations of EHR items and services, <br/>
we committed to retiring certification criteria editions that are no longer applicable.<a href="ONCs.html#42">9 </a>We first did <br/>
this with the removal of the 2011 Edition (79 FR 54447). Accordingly, our proposal to remove <br/>
the outdated 2014 Edition for the reasons discussed above would also streamline Program <br/>
compliance requirements and ensure there is no regulatory confusion between ONC's rules and <br/>
other HHS rules.  <br/>
To implement the removal of the 2014 Edition from the CFR, we propose to remove the <br/>
2014 Edition certification criteria<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/170.314"> (§ 170.314)</a> and related standards, terms, and requirements <br/>

from the CFR. In regard to terms, we propose to retire the 2014 Edition-related definitions found <br/>
in § 170.102, including the “2014 Edition Base EHR,” “2014 Edition EHR certification criteria,” <br/>
and “Complete EHR, 2014 Edition.” As explained in the 2015 Edition final rule (80 FR 62719), <br/>
the ability to maintain Complete EHR certification is only permitted with health IT certified to <br/>
the 2014 Edition certification criteria. Because this concept was discontinued for the 2015 <br/>
Edition, we propose to remove § 170.545 and any references to Complete EHR from the <br/>
regulation text in conjunction with the removal of the 2014 Edition. We also propose to remove <br/>
references to the 2014 Edition from the Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS) definition. However, <br/>
as discussed later in section IV.B.1 (“United States Core Data for Interoperability”) of this <br/>
proposed rule, we propose to remove the CCDS definition from the CFR and effectively replace <br/>
it with a new government-unique standard, the United States Core Data for Interoperability <br/>
(USCDI), proposing to adopt Version 1 (v1) in § 170.213. The new standard would be applicable <br/>
to certain 2015 Edition certification criteria that currently reference the CCDS, subject to any of <br/>
these criteria being removed through this rulemaking). <br/>
We propose to remove the standards and implementation specifications found in §§ <br/>
170.200, 170.202, 170.204, 170.205, 170.207, 170.210, and 170.299 that are only referenced in <br/>
the 2014 Edition certification criteria. Adopted standards that are also referenced in the 2015 <br/>
Edition would remain. We propose to remove requirements in § 170.550(f)<i> </i>and any other <br/>
requirements in subpart E, §§ 170.500 through 170.599, which are specific to the 2014 Edition <br/>
and do not apply to the 2015 Edition.  <br/>

CY 2018 Updates to the Quality Payment Program: Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstance <br/>
Policy for the Transition Year” (82 FR 53568), permits eligible clinicians to use health IT <br/>
certified to either the 2014 or 2015 Edition certification criteria, or a combination of the two for <br/>
the CY 2018 performance period. The QPP final rule also states that the 2015 Edition will be the <br/>
sole edition permitted to meet the CEHRT definition starting with the CY 2019 program year. <br/>
Therefore, we propose that the effective date of removal of the 2014 Edition certification criteria <br/>
and related standards, terms, and requirements from the CFR would be the effective date of a <br/>
subsequent final rule for this proposed rule, which we expect will be issued in the latter half of <br/>
2019. We note that we will continue to support Medicare and Medicaid program attestations by <br/>
maintaining an archive on the CHPL allowing the public to access historic information on a <br/>
product certified to the 2014 Edition.  <br/>
 <br/>
3. Removal of the ONC-Approved Accreditor from the Program <br/>
We propose to remove the ONC-Approved Accreditor (ONC-AA) from the Program. The <br/>
ONC-AA’s role is to accredit certification bodies for the Program and to oversee the ONC-<br/>
ACBs. However, years of experience and changes with the Program have led ONC to conclude <br/>
that, in many respects, the role of the ONC-AA to oversee ONC-ACBs is now duplicative of <br/>
ONC’s oversight. More specifically, ONC’s experience with administering the Principles of <br/>
Proper Conduct for ONC-ACBs as well as issuing necessary regulatory changes (e.g., ONC-<br/>
ACB surveillance and reporting requirements in the 2015 Edition final rule) has demonstrated <br/>
that ONC on its own has the capacity to provide the appropriate oversight of ONC-ACBs. <br/>

 <br/>
Therefore, we believe removal of the ONC-AA would reduce the Program’s administrative <br/>
complexity and burden.  <br/>
To implement this proposed deregulatory action, we propose to remove the definition for <br/>
“ONC-Approved Accreditor or ONC-AA” found in § 170.502. We also propose to remove <br/>
processes related to ONC-AAs found in §§ 170.501(c), 170.503, and 170.504 regarding requests <br/>
for ONC-AA status, ONC-AA ongoing responsibilities, and reconsideration for requests for <br/>
ONC-AA status. Regarding correspondence and communication with ONC, we propose to <br/>
remove specific references to the “ONC-AA” and “accreditation organizations requesting ONC-<br/>
AA status” by revising § 170.505. We also propose to remove the final rule titled “Permanent <br/>
Certification Program for Health Information Technology; Revisions to ONC-Approved <br/>
Accreditor Processes<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/76-FR-72636">” (76 FR 72636)</a> which  established a process for addressing instances <br/>
where the ONC-AA engages in improper conduct or does not perform its responsibilities under <br/>
the Program. Because this prior final rule relates solely to the role and removal of the ONC-AA, <br/>
we propose its removal and § 170.575, which codified the final rule in the CFR. <br/>
These proposed deregulatory actions would also provide an additional benefit for ONC-<br/>
ACBs. ONC-ACBs would be able to obtain and maintain accreditation to ISO/IEC 17065, with <br/>
an appropriate scope, from any accreditation body that is a signatory to the Multilateral <br/>
Recognition Arrangement (MLA) with the International Accreditation Forum (IAF). <br/>
Accordingly, we propose to revise the application process for ONC-ACB status in § <br/>
170.520(a)(3) to require documentation that confirms that the applicant has been accredited to <br/>
ISO/IEC 17065, with an appropriate scope, by any accreditation body that is a signatory to the <br/>
Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) with the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), <br/>

in place of the ONC-AA accreditation documentation requirements. Similarly, instead of <br/>
requiring the ONC-AA to evaluate the conformance of ONC-ACBs to ISO/IEC 17065, we <br/>
propose to revise § 170.523(a) to simply require ONC-ACBs to maintain accreditation in good <br/>
standing to ISO/IEC 17065 for the Program. This means that ONC-ACBs would need to <br/>
continue to comply with ISO/IEC 17065 and requirements specific to the ONC Health IT <br/>
Certification Program scheme.  <br/>
 <br/>
4. Removal of Certain 2015 Edition Certification Criteria and Standards <br/>
We have reviewed and analyzed the 2015 Edition to determine whether there are <br/>
certification criteria we could remove. We have identified both criteria and standards for removal <br/>
as proposed below. We believe the removal of these criteria and standards will reduce burden <br/>
and costs for health IT developers and health care providers by eliminating the need to: design <br/>
and meet specific certification functionalities; prepare, test, and certify health IT in certain <br/>
instances; adhere to associated reporting and disclosure requirements; maintain and update <br/>
certifications for certified functionalities; and participate in surveillance of certified health IT. To <br/>
these points, if our proposals are finalized in a subsequent final rule, we would expect any <br/>
already issued 2015 Edition certificates to be updated to reflect the removal of applicable 2015 <br/>
Edition certification criteria. We welcome comment on the proposed removal of the identified <br/>
criteria and standards below and any other 2015 Edition criteria and standards we should <br/>
consider for removal. <br/>

We propose the removal of certain certification criteria from the 2015 Edition that are <br/>
included in the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition. The removal of these criteria would support <br/>
burden and cost reductions for health IT developers and health care providers as noted above.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
i. Problem List <br/>
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “problem list” certification criterion (§ <br/>
170.315(a)(6)). The functionality in this criterion was first adopted as a 2011 Edition <br/>
certification criterion to support the associated meaningful use Stage 1 objective and measure for <br/>
recording problem list information. In this regard, SNOMED CT® was adopted specifically to <br/>
support the measure. This 2015 Edition “problem list” criterion remains relatively functionally <br/>
the same as the 2011 Edition and has exactly the same functionally as the 2014 Edition “problem <br/>
list” criterion.  <br/>
We propose to remove this criterion for multiple reasons. First, this criterion no longer <br/>
supports the “recording” objective and measure of the CMS Promoting Interoperability Programs <br/>
as such objective and measure no longer exist. Second, the functionality is sufficiently <br/>
widespread among health care providers since it has been part of certification and the Certified <br/>
EHR Technology definition since the 2011 Edition and has not substantively changed with the <br/>
2015 Edition. Third, we do not believe this functionality would be removed from health IT <br/>
systems because of our proposal to remove it from the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition. This <br/>
functionality is essential to clinical care and would be in EHR systems absent certification, <br/>
particularly considering the limited certification requirements. Fourth, this functionality does not <br/>
directly support interoperability as the capabilities are focused on internally recording EHI. In <br/>
this regard, representing problems with SNOMED CT® is part of the USCDI and, thus, better <br/>

no longer be included in the 2015 Edition “safety-enhanced design” criterion. <br/>
ii. Medication List <br/>
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “medication list” certification criterion (§ <br/>
170.315(a)(7)). The functionality in this criterion was first adopted as a 2011 Edition <br/>
certification criterion to support the associated meaningful use Stage 1 objective and measure for <br/>
recording medication list information. The criterion does not require use of a vocabulary <br/>
standard to record medications. This 2015 Edition “medication list” criterion remains <br/>
functionally the same as the 2011 Edition and 2014 Edition “medication list” criteria.  <br/>

iii. Medication Allergy List <br/>

certification criterion to support the associated meaningful use Stage 1 objective and measure for <br/>

iv. Smoking Status <br/>
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “smoking status” criterion (§ 170.315(a)(11)), <br/>
which would include removing it from the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition. We previously <br/>
adopted a 2015 Edition “smoking status” certification criterion that does not reference a <br/>
standard. However, the CCDS definition requires smoking status to be coded in accordance with <br/>
SNOMED CT®. While we continue to believe that the capture of a patient’s smoking status has <br/>
significant value in assisting providers with addressing the number one cause of preventable <br/>
death and disease in the United States, we no longer believe that a criterion that simply ensures <br/>
this functionality exists in health IT presented for certification is the right focus. As with other <br/>
2014 Edition functionality, we believe this functionality is fairly ubiquitous now with the <br/>
widespread adoption of health IT certified to the 2014 Edition. Further, we continue to believe <br/>
that, for the purposes of certification, having smoking status available for access and exchange <br/>
via the USCDI is ultimately the key requirement for supporting interoperability. <br/>

<i>Removal of Specific USCDI Smoking Status Code Sets </i><br/>
 <br/>
As mentioned above, we believe having smoking status available for USCDI purposes is <br/>
fundamentally important for supporting interoperability. We propose, however, to remove the <br/>
requirement to code smoking status according to the adopted eight smoking status SNOMED <br/>
CT® codes as referenced in the value set in § 170.207(h). These eight codes reflect an attempt to <br/>
capture smoking status in a consistent manner. Stakeholder feedback has, however, indicated that <br/>
these eight codes do not appropriately and accurately capture all applicable   patients’ smoking <br/>
statuses. Accordingly, we propose to no longer require use of only the specific eight SNOMED <br/>
CT® codes for representing smoking status (and remove the standard from § 170.207). Rather, to <br/>
continue to promote interoperability while also granting providers with flexibility to better <br/>
support clinical care, we propose that health IT would simply be required to be capable of <br/>
representing smoking status in SNOMED CT® when such information is exchanged as part of <br/>
the USCDI. <br/>
b. Drug-Formulary and Preferred Drug Lists <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “drug formulary and preferred drug list checks” <br/>
criterion in § 170.315(a)(10). We adopted a 2015 Edition “drug-formulary and preferred drug list <br/>
checks” criterion that separates drug formulary and preferred drug list functionality, but does <i>not </i><br/>
require any standards or functionality beyond that included in the 2014 Edition “drug-formulary <br/>
checks” criterion. First, we believe this functionality is fairly ubiquitous now with the <br/>
widespread adoption of health IT certified to the 2014 Edition, which included this general <br/>
functionality. Second, without standards, this criterion does not support or facilitate the critical <br/>

goal of health IT interoperability. Therefore, removal of this criterion could reduce health IT <br/>
developer and health care provider burden. <br/>
c. Patient-Specific Education Resources <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “patient-specific education resources” <br/>
certification criterion (§ 170.315(a)(13)). ONC continues to support patient and provider <br/>
interaction, and the identification and dissemination of patient-specific educational materials to <br/>
promote positive health outcomes. However, we no longer believe that certification focused on a <br/>
health IT’s ability to identifying the existence of patient-specific education materials encourages <br/>
the advancement of this functionality or interoperability. First, this criterion would no longer be <br/>
associated with an objective or measure under the Promoting Interoperability Programs based on <br/>
proposals and determinations in recent CMS rulemakings (83 FR 35928; 83 FR 41664). Second, <br/>
based on the number of health IT products that have been certified for this functionality as part <br/>
of 2014 Edition certification and already for 2015 Edition certification, we believe that health <br/>
IT’s ability to identify appropriate patient education materials is widespread now among health <br/>
IT developers and their customers (e.g., health care providers). Third, we have recently seen <br/>
innovative advancements in this field, including the use of automation and algorithms to provide <br/>
appropriate educations materials to patients in a timely manner. These advancements help limit <br/>
clinical workflow interruptions and demonstrate the use and promise of health IT to create <br/>
efficiencies and improve patient care. As such, removal of this criterion would prevent <br/>
certification from creating an unnecessary burden for developers and providers and an <br/>
impediment to innovation. <br/>

 <br/>
We assessed the number of products certified to the 2015 Edition “Common Clinical <br/>
Data Set summary record – create” (§ 170.315(b)(4)) and “Common Clinical Data Set summary <br/>
record – receive” (§ 170.315(b)(5)) criteria that have not also been certified to the 2015 Edition <br/>
“transitions of care” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1). We did this because the 2015 Edition “CCDS <br/>
summary record” criteria include the same functionality as the 2015 Edition “transitions of care” <br/>
criterion, except for Direct-related transport functionality. Based on our findings of only two <br/>
unique products certified to these criteria at the time of the drafting of this proposed rule, there <br/>
appears to be little market demand for certification to them. This outcome is likely attributable to <br/>
the fact mentioned above regarding their relationship to the 2015 Edition “transition of care” <br/>
criterion, that they are not included in the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition, and that no HHS <br/>
program specifically requires the use of health IT certified to the criteria. Therefore, we propose <br/>
to remove these certification criteria from the 2015 Edition.  <br/>
 <br/>
e. Secure Messaging <br/>
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “secure messaging” criterion (§ 170.315(e)(2)). <br/>
ONC strongly supports patient and provider communication, as well as protecting the privacy <br/>
and security of patient information. However, we no longer believe that separate certification <br/>
focused on a health IT’s ability to send and receive secure messages between health care <br/>
providers and patients is necessary. First, this criterion would no longer be associated with an <br/>
objective or measure under the Promoting Interoperability Programs based on proposals and <br/>
determinations in recent CMS rulemakings (83 FR 41664; 83 FR 35929). Second, there are <br/>
multiple other 2015 Edition certification criteria that support patient engagement, such as the <br/>
2015 Edition “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party,” “API,” and “patient health information <br/>

capture” certification criteria. Third, we have seen developers integrate this functionality as part <br/>
of other patient engagement features, such as patient portals. With these considerations in mind <br/>
and the lack of a negative impact on health IT interoperability, we believe that the removal of <br/>
this criterion will help reduce burden and costs, while also spurring further innovations in patient <br/>
engagement. <br/>
5. Removal of Certain ONC Health IT Certification Program Requirements <br/>
We propose to remove certain mandatory disclosure requirements and a related <br/>
attestation requirement under the Program. We believe removal of these requirements will <br/>
reduce costs and burden for Program stakeholders, particularly health IT developers and ONC-<br/>
ACBs. We welcome comment on the proposed removal of these requirements and any other <br/>
certification or Program requirements we should consider for removal. <br/>
 <br/>
a. Limitations Disclosures <br/>
We propose to remove § 170.523(k)(1)(iii)(B), which requires ONC-ACBs to ensure that <br/>
certified health IT includes a detailed description of all known material information concerning <br/>
limitations that a user may encounter in the course of implementing and using the certified health <br/>
IT, whether to meet “meaningful use” objectives and measures or to achieve any other use within <br/>
the scope of the health IT's certification. We also propose to remove § 170.523(k)(1)(iv)(B) and <br/>
(C), which state that the types of information required to be disclosed include, but are not limited <br/>
to: (B) limitations, whether by contract or otherwise, on the use of any capability to which <br/>
technology is certified for any purpose within the scope of the technology's certification; or in <br/>
connection with any data generated in the course of using any capability to which health IT is <br/>
certified; (C) Limitations, including but not limited to technical or practical limitations of <br/>

technology or its capabilities, that could prevent or impair the successful implementation, <br/>
configuration, customization, maintenance, support, or use of any capabilities to which <br/>
technology is certified; or that could prevent or limit the use, exchange, or portability of any data <br/>
generated in the course of using any capability to which technology is certified.  <br/>
These disclosure requirements regarding certified health IT limitations are superseded by <br/>
the Cures Act information blocking provision and Conditions of Certification, which we are <br/>
implementing with this proposed rule. In particular, section 3001(c)(5)(D)(ii) of the<b> </b>Cures Act <br/>
requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition of Certification under the Program, provide <br/>
assurances to the Secretary that, unless for legitimate purposes specified by the Secretary, the <br/>
developer will not take any action that constitutes information blocking as defined in section <br/>
3022(a) of the PHSA, or any other action that may inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and <br/>
use of electronic health information. These assurances specifically focus on preventing <br/>
information blocking and promoting appropriate exchange, access, and use of electronic health <br/>
information. We further propose adding as a complementary Condition of Certification that <br/>
developers would be prohibited from taking any action that could interfere with a user’s ability <br/>
to access or use certified capabilities for any purpose within the scope of the technology’s <br/>
certification. Such actions may inhibit the appropriate access, exchange, or use of electronic <br/>
health information and are therefore contrary to this proposed Condition of Certification and the <br/>
statutory provision that it implements. Based on these Conditions of Certification, we believe <br/>
that disclosures of limitations by health IT developers would be unlikely and unnecessary given <br/>
their prohibition. <br/>

 <br/>
 We propose to remove the Principle of Proper Conduct (PoPC) in § 170.523(k)(2), <br/>
which requires a health IT developer to submit an attestation that it will disclose all of the <br/>
information in its mandatory disclosures per § 170.523(k)(1) to specified parties (e.g., potential <br/>
customers or anyone inquiring about a product quote or description of services). We propose that <br/>
this provision is no longer necessary and that its removal is appropriate to further reduce <br/>
administrative burden for health IT developers and ONC-ACBs. First, our experience with <br/>
developer attestations to this requirement is that over 90% of developers with certified health IT <br/>
have attested that they will provide “transparency information.” Second, the information that <br/>
developers would be asked to attest to, whether our proposal above to remove certain disclosure <br/>
requirements is finalized or not, is now readily available on health IT developers’ websites as the <br/>
mandatory disclosure requirements were implemented almost three years ago. Therefore, we <br/>
believe removal of this requirement is appropriate.  <br/>
6. Recognition of Food and Drug Administration Processes <br/>
Section 618 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), <br/>
Public Law 112-144, required that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in consultation <br/>
with ONC and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) (collectively referred to as “the <br/>
Agencies”<a href="ONCs.html#56">10</a> for this proposal), develop a report that contains a proposed strategy and <br/>
recommendations on an appropriate, risk-based regulatory framework pertaining to health IT, <br/>
including mobile medical applications, that promotes innovation, protects patient safety, and <br/>
avoids regulatory duplication. The FDASIA Health IT Report of April 2014<a href="ONCs.html#56">11</a> contains a <br/>

proposed strategy and recommendations on an appropriate, risk-based regulatory framework <br/>
pertaining to health IT that promotes innovation, protects patient safety, and avoids regulatory <br/>
duplication. Public comments, received prior to the report and after,<a href="ONCs.html#57">12</a> recommended that health <br/>
IT developers/manufacturers apply a single process that satisfies the requirements of all agencies <br/>
and that existing safety and quality-related processes, systems, and standards should be leveraged <br/>
for patient safety in health IT. On July 27, 2017, FDA announced a voluntary Software <br/>
Precertification (Pre-Cert) Pilot Program as part of a broader Digital Health Innovation Action <br/>
Plan.<a href="ONCs.html#57">13 </a>It was developed in order to create a tailored approach toward recognizing the unique <br/>
characteristics of digital technology by looking first at the firm, rather than primarily at each <br/>
product of the firm, as is currently done for traditional medical products. The FDA plans to <br/>
explore whether and how pre-certified companies that have demonstrated a culture of quality, <br/>
patient safety, and organizational excellence could bring certain types of digital health products <br/>
to market either without FDA premarket review or with a more streamlined FDA premarket <br/>
review.  <br/>
a. FDA Software Pre-Certification Pilot Program <br/>
ONC believes that health IT developers that hold precertification under the FDA Digital <br/>
Health Software Precertification Program (FDA Software Precertification Program) when they <br/>
present health IT for certification under the Program could qualify for, and benefit from, further <br/>
efficiencies under the Program. Title IV of the Cures Act provides ONC with authority under the <br/>

Program to oversee health IT developers through Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirements (<i>see </i>section VII Conditions and Maintenance of Certification of this proposed <br/>
rule). With this new authority and our authority over health IT developers’ health IT certified <br/>
under the Program, we propose to establish processes that would provide health IT developers <br/>
that can document holding precertification under the FDA Software Precertification Program <br/>
with exemptions to the ONC Health IT Certification Program’s requirements for testing and <br/>
certification of its health IT to the 2015 Edition “quality management systems” criterion (§ <br/>
170.315(g)(4)) and the 2015 Edition “safety-enhanced design” criterion (§ 170.315(g)(3)), as <br/>
these criteria are applicable to the health IT developer’s health IT presented for certification. We <br/>
also believe that such a “recognition” could, depending on the final framework of the FDA <br/>
Software Precertification Program (e.g., the key performance indicators used to demonstrate <br/>
performance and outcomes of excellence), be applicable to the functionally-based 2015 Edition <br/>
“clinical” certification criteria (§ 170.315(a)). More specifically, this could address the <br/>
“computerized provider order entry (CPOE)” (§ 170.315(a)(1), (2), and (3)), “drug-drug, drug-<br/>
allergy interaction checks for CPOE” (§ 170.315(a)(4)), “clinical decision support” (§ <br/>
170.315(a)(9)), and “implantable device list” (§ 170.315(a)(14)) certification criteria.  Such <br/>
“recognition” could also be appropriate to address any or all of the following functionally-based <br/>
2015 Edition criteria in the event their proposed removal is not finalized: “problem list” (§ <br/>
170.315(a)(6)), “medication list” (§ 170.315(a)(7)), “medication allergy list” (§ 170.315(a)(8)), <br/>
“drug-formulary and preferred drug list checks” (§ 170.315(a)(10)),” and “smoking status” (§ <br/>

Our proposed “recognition” would align with both Executive Orders 13563 and 13771 <br/>
regarding deregulatory, less burdensome, and more effective initiatives. It would also serve as a <br/>
regulatory relief for those health IT developers qualifying as small businesses under the <br/>
Regulatory Flexibility Act (<i>see</i> section XIV.C.3 Regulatory Flexibility Act of this proposed <br/>
rule). Furthermore, it would closely align with FDASIA’s instruction to promote innovation, <br/>
protect patient safety, and avoid regulatory duplication. However, despite these proffered <br/>
benefits, there may be reasons not to adopt such a “recognition” approach. For example, <br/>
stakeholders may not agree that the FDA Software Precertification Program (and/or subsequent <br/>
finalized program) sufficiently aligns with our Program. Developers and providers may have <br/>
varying and divergent views about the benefits and detriments of such an approach. Further, <br/>
while we believe that we could properly operationalize such an approach by ensuring <br/>
certifications indicate which criteria have been “deemed certified” by ONC (but still subject to <br/>
ONC-ACB surveillance), stakeholders may have other operational concerns. Accordingly, we <br/>
welcome comments on these and other aspects of our proposed “recognition” approach, <br/>
including the 2015 Edition certification criteria that should be eligible for “recognition.” <br/>
b.  Development of Similar Independent Program Processes – Request for <br/>
Information <br/>
Recognition of the FDA Software Pre-Certification Program for purposes of our <br/>
Program, as noted above, may eventually be determined to be infeasible or insufficient to meet <br/>
our goals of reducing burden and promoting innovation. With this in mind, we request comment <br/>
on whether ONC should establish new regulatory processes tailored towards recognizing the <br/>
unique characteristics of health IT (e.g., EHR software) by looking first at the health IT <br/>

developer, rather than primarily at the health IT presented for certification, as is currently done <br/>
under the Program. For example, ONC could possibly establish Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification requirements, through rulemaking, that facilitate the deeming of all of a health IT <br/>
developer’s health IT as “certified” under the Program for certification criteria identified by <br/>
ONC as solely “functionally-based” criteria  (i.e., not essential to interoperability, such as the <br/>
“CPOE” criteria) or possibly broader in scope. This approach could rely on, but not be limited to, <br/>
one or a combination of the following: (1) certain demonstrated health IT developer processes or <br/>
health IT functionality; (2) prior successful certification of a health IT developer’s health IT <br/>
under the Program; (3) results of real world testing for interoperability as required by the Cures <br/>
Act and the proposed implementing regulatory Condition of Certification (<i>see</i> section VII.B.5 of <br/>
this proposed rule); and/or (4) the results of the EHR Reporting Program once implemented (<i>see </i><br/>
section VII.B.7 of this proposed rule). No matter the specifics, we are most interested in whether <br/>
stakeholders believe this is an approach we should pursue in conjunction with, or in lieu of, the <br/>
proposed approach of recognizing the FDA Software Pre-Certification Pilot Program. We also <br/>
welcome more specific comments on the health IT developer criteria for such an approach and <br/>
what the Conditions and/or Maintenance of Certification requirements should be to support such <br/>
an approach within the framework of the proposed Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirements discussed in section VII of this proposed rule.  <br/>

<i>A. Standards and Implementation Specifications </i><br/>
1. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act<i> </i><br/>
The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) of 1995 (15 U.S.C. <br/>
3701 et. seq.) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A–119<a href="ONCs.html#61">14 </a>require the <br/>
use of, wherever practical, technical standards that are developed or adopted by voluntary <br/>
consensus standards bodies to carry out policy objectives or activities, with certain exceptions. <br/>
The NTTAA and OMB Circular A-119 provide exceptions to electing only standards developed <br/>
or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies, namely when doing so would be <br/>
inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Agencies have the discretion to <br/>
decline the use of existing voluntary consensus standards if determined that such standards are <br/>
inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical, and instead use a government-unique <br/>
standard or other standard. In addition to the consideration of voluntary consensus standards, the <br/>
OMB Circular A-119 recognizes the contributions of standardization activities that take place <br/>
outside of the voluntary consensus standards process. Therefore, in instances where use of <br/>
voluntary consensus standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise <br/>
impracticable, other standards should be considered that meet the agency’s regulatory, <br/>
procurement or program needs, deliver favorable technical and economic outcomes, and are <br/>

widely utilized in the marketplace. In this proposed rule, we use voluntary consensus standards <br/>
except for: <br/>
•  The standard we propose to adopt in § 170.213. We propose to remove the Common Clinical <br/>
Data Set (CCDS) definition and effectively replace it with a government unique standard, the <br/>
United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI), Version 1(v1); <br/>
•  The standard we propose to adopt in § 170.215(a)(2). We propose the government unique <br/>
API Resource Collection in Health (ARCH) Version 1 implementation specification;               <br/>
•  The standards we propose to adopt in § 170.215(a)(3) through (5) for application <br/>
programming interfaces (APIs). These market driven consortia standards have been <br/>
developed through a streamlined process that does not meet the full definition of voluntary <br/>
consensus standards development but still includes representation from those interested in the <br/>
use cases supported by the standards (e.g., health IT developers and health care providers). In <br/>
the absence of available voluntary consensus standards that would meet our needs, these <br/>
standards deliver favorable technical and economic outcomes, particularly improved <br/>
interoperability. Further, some of these standards may eventually proceed through a <br/>
standards development organization for approval; and <br/>
•  The standards we propose to adopt in § 170.205(h)(3) and (k)(3). We propose to replace the <br/>
current HL7 QRDA standards with government unique standards that more effectively <br/>
support the associated certification criterion’s use case, which is reporting eCQM data to <br/>

In accordance with Office of the Federal Register regulations related to “incorporation by <br/>
reference,” 1 CFR part 51, which we follow when we adopt proposed standards and/or <br/>
implementation specifications in any subsequent final rule, the entire standard or implementation <br/>
specification document is deemed published in the <b>Federal Register</b> when incorporated by <br/>
reference therein with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register. Once published, <br/>
compliance with the standard and implementation specification includes the entire document <br/>
unless we specify otherwise. For example, if we adopted the Health Level 7 (HL7) Argonaut <br/>
Data Query Implementation Guide (IG) proposed in this proposed rule (<i>see</i> section VII.B.4.b), <br/>
health IT certified to certification criteria referencing this IG would need to demonstrate <br/>
compliance with all mandatory elements and requirements of the IG. If an element of the IG is <br/>
optional or permissive in any way, it would remain that way for testing and certification <i>unless </i><br/>
we specified otherwise in regulation. In such cases, the regulatory text would preempt the <br/>
permissiveness of the IG. <br/>
3. “Reasonably Available” to Interested Parties <br/>
The Office of the Federal Register has established requirements for materials (e.g., <br/>
standards and implementation specifications) that agencies propose to incorporate by reference <br/>
in the <b>Code of Federal Regulations </b>(79 FR 66267; 1 CFR 51.5(a)). To comply with these <br/>
requirements, in section X (“Incorporation by Reference”) of this preamble, we provide <br/>
summaries of, and uniform resource locators (URLs) to, the standards and implementation <br/>
specifications we propose to adopt and subsequently incorporate by reference in the <b>Code of </b><br/>

<i>B. Revised and New 2015 Edition Criteria   </i><br/>
<i> </i><br/>
In order to capture and share patient data efficiently, health care providers need health <br/>
IT that store data in structured formats. Structured data allows health care providers to easily <br/>
retrieve and transfer patient information, and use health IT in ways that can aid patient care. We <br/>
propose to adopt revised and new 2015 Edition certification criteria, including new standards, to <br/>
support these objectives. Some of these criteria and standards are included in the Certified EHR <br/>
Technology (CEHRT) definition used for participation in HHS Programs, such as the Promoting <br/>
Interoperability Programs (formerly the EHR Incentive Programs), some are required to be met <br/>
for participation in the ONC Health IT Certification Program, and some, though beneficial, are <br/>
unassociated with the CEHRT definition and <b>not</b> <b>required</b> for participating in any HHS <br/>
program, including the ONC Health IT Certification Program.  <br/>
1. The United States Core Data for Interoperability Standard (USCDI) <br/>
The initial focus of the Program was to support the Medicare and Medicaid EHR <br/>
Incentive Programs (76 FR 1294) now referred to as the Promoting Interoperability Programs <br/>
(and referenced as such hereafter). As such, the 2014 Edition certification criteria mirrored those <br/>
functions specified by Promoting Interoperability Programs’ objectives and measures. In order to <br/>
improve efficiency and streamline the common data within our Program’s certification criteria, <br/>
we created a single definition for all the required data which could be referenced for all <br/>
applicable certification criteria. We created the term “Common MU Data Set” to encompass the <br/>
common set of MU data types/elements (and associated vocabulary standards) for which <br/>
certification would be required across several certification criteria (77 FR 54170).  <br/>

 <br/>
The 2015 Edition final rule modified the Program to make it open and accessible to more <br/>
types of health IT, and health IT that supports various care and practice settings beyond those <br/>
included in the Promoting Interoperability Programs (80 FR 62604). In comparison to the <br/>
previous editions, the 2015 Edition focused on identifying health IT components necessary to <br/>
establish an interoperable nationwide health information infrastructure, fostering innovation and <br/>
open new market opportunities, and allowing for more health care provider and patient choices <br/>
in electronic health information access and exchange. In order to align with this approach, we <br/>
revised the concept of the “Common MU Data Set” definition and changed the name to the <br/>
“Common Clinical Data Set” (CCDS) definition. The CCDS definition was further revised in the <br/>
2015 Edition rulemaking to account for new and updated vocabulary and content standards in <br/>
order to improve and advance interoperability and health information exchange (80 FR 62604). It <br/>
further expanded accessibility and availability of data exchanged by updating the definition of <br/>
Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) (2015 Edition Base EHR definition) to include enhanced <br/>
data export, transitions of care, and application programming interface (API) capabilities, all of <br/>
which required that at a minimum the CCDS be available (80 FR 62602-62604).  <br/>
 <br/>
The regulatory approach to use and reference a “definition” to identify electronic health <br/>
information, including with associated vocabulary codes, for access, exchange and use has had <br/>
its drawbacks. While the CCDS definition served its designed purpose, to cut down on repetitive <br/>
text in each of the certification criteria in which it is referenced, it also began to be colloquially <br/>
used for many different purposes. As the CCDS definition’s relevance grew outside of its <br/>
regulatory context it became a symbolic and practical limit to the industry’s collective interests <br/>
to go beyond the CCDS data for access, exchange, and use. As we move towards value-based <br/>

care and the inclusion of data classes that go beyond clinical data, and as part of ONC’s <br/>
continued efforts to evaluate the availability of a minimum baseline of data classes that must be <br/>
commonly available for interoperable exchange, we acknowledge the need to change and <br/>
improve our regulatory approach to the CCDS. Therefore, in order to advance interoperability by <br/>
ensuring compliance with new data and vocabulary codes sets that support the data, we propose <br/>
to remove the “Common Clinical Data Set” definition and its references from the 2015 Edition <br/>
and replace it with the “United States Core Data for Interoperability” (USCDI) standard. The <br/>
USCDI standard aims to achieve the goals set forth in the Cures Act by specifying a common set <br/>
of data classes for interoperable exchange. <br/>
We propose to adopt the USCDI as a standard as such term is defined in § 170.102. In § <br/>
170.102, a “standard” is defined as a “technical, functional, or performance-based rule, <br/>
condition, requirement, or specification that stipulates instructions, fields, codes, data, materials, <br/>
characteristics, or actions.” The USCDI standard would comprise data classes, which may be <br/>
further delineated into groupings of specific data element(s). For example, “patient <br/>
demographics” is a data class and within that data class there is “patient name,” which is a data <br/>
element. As noted in section IV.B.1.b, for the overall structure and organization of the USCDI, <br/>
please consult<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/USCDI"> www.healthIT.gov/USCDI. </a>  <br/>
ONC intends to establish and follow a predictable, transparent, and collaborative process <br/>
to expand the USCDI, including providing stakeholders with the opportunity to comment on the <br/>
USCDI’s expansion. Once the Secretary adopts the first version of the USCDI through <br/>
rulemaking, which we propose in this rulemaking, health IT developers would be allowed to take <br/>
advantage of the “Standards Version Advancement Process” flexibility. The Standards Version <br/>

Advancement Process , proposed in Section VII.B.5 (below), would permit health IT developers <br/>
to voluntarily implement and use a new version of an adopted standard (e.g., the USCDI), <br/>
subject to certain conditions including a requirement that the new version is approved for use by <br/>
the National Coordinator.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
a. USCDI 2015 Edition Certification Criteria <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to adopt the USCDI Version 1 (USCDI v1) in § 170.213. <a href="ONCs.html#67">15</a> The USCDI is a <br/>
standardized set of health data classes and constituent data elements that would be required to <br/>
support nationwide electronic health information exchange. Once adopted in a final rule, health <br/>
IT developers would be required to update their certified health IT to support the USCDI v1 for <br/>
all certification criteria affected by this proposed change. We propose to revise the following <br/>
CCDS dependent 2015 Edition certification criteria to incorporate the USCDI standard: <br/>
•  “transitions of care” (§ 170.315(b)(1));  <br/>
•  “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” (§ 170.315(e)(1));  <br/>
•  “consolidated CDA creation performance” (§ 170.315(g)(6)); <br/>
•  “transmission to public health agencies – electronic case reporting” (§ 170.315(f)(5)); and  <br/>
•  “application access – all data request” (§ 170.315(g)(9)). <br/>
We note that we did not include the “data export” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(6)) as we are <br/>
proposing to remove it and adopt instead the “EHI export” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(10)). For <br/>
similar reasons, we did not include the “application access – data category request” criterion (§ <br/>
                                                 <br/>
15 We note that USCDI v1is an updated version and distinguished from the <i>Draft United States Core Data for <br/>Interoperability (USCDI)</i> previously made available for public review and comment in the course of its development <br/>as a prospective standard.   <br/>

170.315(g)(8)) because we are proposing to replace it with the API certification criterion (§ <br/>
170.315(g)(10)), which derives its data requirements from the USCDI. <br/>
We propose, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement for the real world testing  <br/>
Condition of Certification, that health IT developers with health IT certified to the five above-<br/>
identified certification criteria prior to the effective date of a subsequent final rule would have to <br/>
update such certified health IT to the proposed revisions. We further propose, as a Maintenance <br/>
of Certification requirement for the real world testing Condition of Certification, that health IT <br/>
developers must provide the updated certified health IT to all their customers with health IT <br/>
previously certified to the identified criteria no later than 24 months after the effective date of a <br/>
final rule for this proposed rule. For the purposes of meeting this compliance timeline, we expect <br/>
health IT developers to update their certified health IT without new mandatory testing and notify <br/>
their ONC-ACB on the date at which they have reached compliance. Developers would also <br/>
need to factor these updates into their next real world testing plan as discussed in section VII.B.5 <br/>
of this proposed rule. Further, we refer health IT developer to the next section, which describes <br/>
how the USCDI differs from the current CCDS. <br/>
b. USCDI Standard - Data Classes Included  <br/>
 <br/>
The USCDI Version 1 (USCDI v1) and its constituent data elements account for the <br/>
public comments we received on the Draft USCDI and Proposed Expansion Process<a href="ONCs.html#68">16</a> published <br/>
in January 2018 as well as initial feedback from the Health IT Advisory Committee. The <br/>
standard as we propose to adopt it in § 170.213 also reflects and acknowledges the burden that <br/>
rapidly expanding the USCDI v1 beyond the CCDS could cause. As a result, the USCDI v1 is a <br/>

modest expansion of the CCDS, which we believe most health IT developers already support, <br/>
were already working toward, or should be capable of updating their health IT to support in a <br/>

 <br/>
i. Updated Versions of Vocabulary Standard Code Sets <br/>
We propose that the USCDI Version 1 (USCDI v1) include the newest versions of the <br/>
“minimum standard” code sets included in the CCDS available at publication of a subsequent <br/>
final rule. We request comment on this proposal and on whether this could result in any <br/>
interoperability concerns. To note, criteria such as the 2015 Edition “family health history” <br/>
criterion (§ 170.315(a)(12)), the 2015 Edition “transmission to immunization registries” criterion <br/>
(§ 170.315(f)(1)), and the 2015 Edition “transmission to public health agencies—syndromic <br/>
surveillance” criterion (§ 170.315(f)(2)) reference “minimum standard” code sets; however, we <br/>
are considering changing the certification baseline versions of the code set for these criteria from <br/>
the versions adopted in the 2015 Edition final rule to ensure complete interoperability alignment. <br/>
We welcome comment on whether we should adopt such an approach. <br/>
We also note, for purposes of clarity, that consistent with § 170.555, unless the Secretary <br/>
prohibits the use of a newer version of an identified minimum standard code set for certification, <br/>
health IT could continue to be certified or upgraded to a newer version of an identified minimum <br/>
standard code set than that included in USCDI v1 or the most recent USCDI version that the <br/>
National Coordinator has approved for use in the Program via the Standards Version <br/>
Advancement Process.   <br/>

 <br/>
ii. Address and Phone Number <br/>
 <br/>
The USCDI v1 includes new data elements for “address” and “phone number.” The <br/>
inclusion of “address” (to represent the postal location for the patient) and “phone number” (to <br/>
represent the patient’s telephone number) would improve the comprehensiveness of health <br/>
information for patient care. The inclusion of these data elements is also consistent with the list <br/>
of patient matching data elements already specified in the 2015 Edition “transitions of care” <br/>
certification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)), which supports the exchange of patient health <br/>
information between providers of patient care.   <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
iii. Pediatric Vital Signs <br/>
 <br/>
The USCDI v1 includes the pediatric vital sign data elements, which are specified as <br/>
optional health information in the 2015 Edition CCDS definition. Pediatric vital signs include: <br/>
head occipital-frontal circumference for children less than 3 years of age, BMI percentile per age <br/>
and sex for youth 2-20 years of age, weight for age per length and sex for children less than 3 <br/>
years of age, and the reference range/scale or growth curve, as appropriate. As explained in <br/>
section VI.A.2 of this proposed rule, the inclusion of pediatric vital sign data elements in the <br/>
draft USCDI v1 would align with the provisions of the Cures Act related to health IT to support <br/>
the health care of children. Stakeholders emphasized the value of pediatric vital sign data <br/>
elements to better support the safety and quality of care delivered to children. We also note that, <br/>
as discussed in the 2015 Edition proposed rule, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <br/>
(CDC) recommends the use of these pediatric vital signs for settings of care in which pediatric <br/>
and adolescent patients are seen <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/80-FR-16818">(80 FR 16818-</a>16819) as part of best practices. The availability <br/>
of a reference range/scale or growth curve would help with proper interpretation of the <br/>

measurements for the BMI percentile per age and sex and weight for age per length and sex. <br/>
Further, the inclusion of this health information in the USCDI v1 is the appropriate next step <br/>
after first specifying them as optional in the CCDS definition as part of the 2015 Edition <br/>
rulemaking and as a means of supporting patient access to their EHI in a longitudinal format <br/>
through certified health IT (<i>see</i> section 3009(e)(2)(A)(i) of the PHSA as amended by the Cures <br/>
Act). We recognize, however, that certain health IT developers and their customers may not find <br/>
these capabilities and information useful. Therefore, we request comment on the inclusion of <br/>
pediatric vital signs in the USCDI v1, including the potential benefits and costs for all <br/>
stakeholders stemming from its inclusion in the USCDI v1.  <br/>
iv. Clinical Notes  <br/> <br/>
The USCDI v1 includes a new data class, titled “clinical notes.” “Clinical notes” is <br/>
included in the USCDI v1 based on significant feedback from the industry since the 2015 Edition <br/>
final rule. We also received feedback during the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common <br/>
Agreement (TEFCA) stakeholder sessions and public comment period. It has been identified by <br/>
stakeholders as highly desirable data for interoperable exchange. The free text portion of the <br/>
clinical notes was most often relayed by clinicians as the data they sought, but were often <br/>
missing during electronic health information exchange. Clinical notes can be composed of text <br/>
generated from structured (pick-list and/or check the box) fields as well as unstructured (free <br/>
text) data. A clinical note may include the assessment, diagnosis, plan of care and evaluation of <br/>
plan, patient teaching, and other relevant data points.  <br/>
We recognize that a number of different clinical notes could be useful for stakeholders. It <br/>
is our understanding that work is being done in the community to focus on a subset of clinical <br/>

notes. We considered three options for identifying the different “note types” to adopt in USCDI <br/>
v1. The first option we considered would allow for the community to offer any and all <br/>
recommended notes. The second option we considered would set a minimum standard of eight <br/>
note types. This option was derived from the eight note types identified by the Argonaut Project <br/>
participants.<a href="ONCs.html#72">17 </a>The third option we identified would look to the eleven HL7 Consolidated <br/>
Clinical Data Architecture (C-CDA) document types identified in the C-CDA Release 2.1, which <br/>
also included the note types being identified by the Argonaut Project participants. We ultimately <br/>
decided to move forward with the second option because it unites public and private interests <br/>
toward the same goal. The eight selected note types are a minimum bar and, in the future, the <br/>
USCDI may be updated to include other clinical notes. Specifically, we propose to include the <br/>
following clinical note types for both inpatient and outpatient (primary care, emergency <br/>
department, etc.) settings in USCDI v1 as a minimum standard: (1) Discharge Summary note; (2) <br/>
History &amp; Physical; (3) Progress Note; (4) Consultation Note; (5) Imaging Narrative; (6) <br/>
Laboratory Report Narrative; (7) Pathology Report Narrative; and (8) Procedures Note. We seek <br/>
comment on whether to include additional note types as part of the USCDI v1. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
v. Provenance <br/>
The USCDI v1 also includes a new data class, titled “provenance.” “Provenance” has <br/>
been identified by stakeholders<a href="ONCs.html#72">18 </a>as valuable for interoperable exchange. The provenance of data <br/>
was also referenced by stakeholders as a fundamental need to improve the trustworthiness and <br/>

reliability of the data being exchanged. Provenance describes the metadata, or extra information <br/>
about data, that can help answer questions such as when and who created the data.  <br/>
The inclusion of “provenance” as a data class in the USCDI v1 would also complement <br/>
the Cures Act requirement to support the exchange of data through the use of APIs. This <br/>
approach differs from the exchange of data via the C-CDA. While C-CDAs are often critiqued <br/>
due to their relative “length,” the C-CDA represents the output of a clinical encounter and <br/>
includes relevant context. The same will not always be true in an API context. APIs facilitate the <br/>
granular exchange of data and, as noted in the 2015 Edition final rule, offer the potential to <br/>
aggregate data from multiple sources in a web or mobile application (80 FR 62675). The <br/>
inclusion of provenance would help retain the relevant context so the recipient can better <br/>
understand the origin of the data. As noted in section VII.B.4, we are also proposing to include <br/>
provenance in our proposed “API Resource Collection in Health” (ARCH) Version 1 <br/>
implementation specification in § 170.215(a)(2), which would list a set of base Fast Healthcare <br/>
Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) resources that Health IT Modules certified to the proposed <br/>
API criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)) would need to support. <br/>
We propose to further delineate the provenance data class into three data elements: “the <br/>
author,” which represents the person(s) who is responsible for the information; “the author’s time <br/>
stamp,” which indicates the time the information was recorded; and “the author’s organization,” <br/>
which would be the organization the author is associated with at the time they interacted with the <br/>
data. We have identified these three data elements as fundamental for data recipients to have <br/>
available and both are commonly captured and currently available through standards. We request <br/>
comment on the inclusion of these three data elements and whether any other provenance data <br/>

(sometimes discussed in standards working groups as the provenance of the data’s “last hop”), <br/>

adopting the industry consensus once it becomes available. <br/>

vi. Unique Device Identifier(s) for a Patient's Implantable Device(s) <br/>
We are aware of a recently published implementation guide (IG) within HL7 that <br/>
provides further guidance on the unique device identifier (UDI) requirements. The IG, Health <br/>
Level 7 (HL7®) CDA R2 Implementation Guide: C-CDA Supplemental Templates for Unique <br/>
Device Identification (UDI) for Implantable Medical Devices, Release 1-US Realm<a href="ONCs.html#74">19,</a> identifies <br/>
changes needed to the C-CDA to better facilitate the exchange of the individual UDI components <br/>
in the health care system when devices are implanted in a patient. The UDI components include <br/>
the Device Identifier (DI) and the following individual production identifiers: the lot or batch <br/>
number, serial number, manufacturing date, expiration date, and distinct identification code. <br/>
However, as this new IG has been recently published, we request comment on whether we <br/>
should add this UDI IG as a requirement for health IT to adopt in order to meet the requirements <br/>
for UDI USCDI Data Class. In addition, we do not have a reliable basis on which to estimate <br/>
how much it would cost to meet the requirements outlined in the UDI IG; and, therefore, we <br/>
request comment on the cost and burden of complying with this proposed requirement.  <br/>

The USCDI v1 “Medication” data class includes two constituent data elements within it: <br/>
Medications and Medication Allergies. With respect to the latter, Medication Allergies, we <br/>
request comment on an alternative approach. This alternative would result in removing the <br/>
Medication Allergies data element from the Medication data class and creating a new data class <br/>
titled, “Substance Reactions,” which would be meant to be inclusive of “Medication Allergies.” <br/>
The new “Substance Reactions” data class would include the following data elements: <br/>
“Substance” and “Reaction,” and include SNOMED CT as an additional applicable standard for <br/>
non-medication substances. <br/>
c. USCDI Standard – Relationship to Content Exchange Standards and <br/>
Implementation Specifications <br/>
 <br/>
In order to align with our approach to be responsive to the evolution of standards and to <br/>
facilitate updates to newer versions of standards, the USCDI v1 (§ 170.213) is “content <br/>
exchange” standard agnostic. It establishes “data policy” and does not directly associate with the <br/>
content exchange standards and implementation specifications which, given a particular context, <br/>
may be necessary to exchange the entire USCDI, a USCDI class, or elements within it. To our <br/>
knowledge, all data classes in the USCDI v1 can be supported by commonly used “content <br/>
exchange” standards, including HL7 C-CDA Release 2.1 and FHIR®. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
d. Clinical Notes C-CDA Implementation Specification <br/>
In conjunction with our proposal to adopt the USCDI v1, we propose to adopt the HL7 <br/>
CDA® R2 IG: C-CDA Templates for Clinical Notes R1 Companion Guide, Release 1 in § <br/>
170.205(a)(4)(i) (“C-CDA Companion Guide”). The C-CDA Companion Guide provides <br/>
supplemental guidance and additional technical clarification for specifying data in the C-CDA <br/>

Release 2.1.<a href="ONCs.html#76">20</a> As noted above, the proposed USCDI v1 includes new data classes, such as <br/>
“clinical notes,” which are further supported through the C-CDA Companion Guide. For <br/>
example, the C-CDA Companion Guide provides specifications for clinical notes by indicating <br/>
that clinical notes should be recorded in “note activity” and requires references to other discrete <br/>
data, such as “encounters.” The C-CDA Companion Guide also enhances implementation of the <br/>
2015 Edition certification criteria that reference the C-CDA Release 2.1 (§ 170.205(a)(4)). As <br/>
noted by stakeholders, the C-CDA Release 2.1 includes some optionality and ambiguity with <br/>
respect to data element components, such as the locations and value sets. We attempted to <br/>
address some of this optionality by clarifying requirements using Certification Companion <br/>
Guides (CCGs)<a href="ONCs.html#76">21 </a>and by specifying in the CCDS definition where certain data should be placed <br/>
in the C-CDA Release 2.1 templates (e.g., “goals” in the goals section).<a href="ONCs.html#76">22 </a>The C-CDA <br/>
Companion Guide, which was released after the 2015 Edition final rule, provides similar, but <br/>
additional C-CDA implementation structure. For example, race and ethnicity are required data <br/>
elements in the USCDI (formerly the CCDS) and must be included in C-CDA exchanges if <br/>
known, or they may be marked with a nullFlavor of UNK (unknown) if not known. The C-CDA <br/>
Release 2.1 is unclear on the location and value set, but the C-CDA Companion Guide clarifies <br/>
the location and value set. The adoption of the C-CDA Companion Guide would align with our <br/>
goal to increase the consistent implementation of standards among health IT developers and <br/>
improve interoperability. We propose to adopt this C-CDA Companion Guide to support best <br/>

practice implementation of USCDI v1 data classes and 2015 Edition certification criteria that <br/>
reference C-CDA Release 2.1 (§ 170.205(a)(4)). The criteria include: <br/>
•  “transitions of care” (§ 170.315(b)(1));  <br/>
•  “clinical information reconciliation and incorporation” (§ 170.315(b)(2));  <br/>
•  “care plan” (§ 170.315(b)(9));  <br/>
•  “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” (§ 170.315(e)(1));  <br/>
•  “consolidated CDA creation performance” (§ 170.315(g)(6)); and <br/>
•  “application access – all data request” (§ 170.315(g)(9)). <br/>
We propose, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement for the real world testing <br/>
Condition of Certification, that health IT developers with health IT certified to the six above-<br/>
identified certification criteria prior to the effective date of a subsequent final rule would have to <br/>
update such certified health IT to the proposed revisions. We further propose, as a Maintenance <br/>
of Certification requirement for the real world testing Condition of Certification, that health IT <br/>
developers must provide the updated certified health IT to all their customers with health IT <br/>
previously certified to the identified criteria no later than 24 months after the effective date of a <br/>
final rule for this proposed rule. For the purposes of meeting this compliance timeline, we expect <br/>
health IT developers to update their certified health IT without new mandatory testing and notify <br/>
their ONC-ACB on the date at which they have reached compliance. Developers would also <br/>
need to factor these updates into their next real world testing plan as discussed in section VII.B.5 <br/>
of this proposed rule.   <br/>

We propose to update the electronic prescribing (e-Rx) SCRIPT standard used for <br/>
“electronic prescribing” in the 2015 Edition to NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071, which would result in <br/>
a new e-Rx standard becoming the baseline for certification. We propose to adopt this standard <br/>
in § 170.205(b)(1). ONC and CMS have historically maintained complementary policies of <br/>
aligning health IT certification criteria and associated standard for e-prescribing with the CMS <br/>
Medicare Part D e-Rx and MH standards (75 FR 44589; 77 FR 54198). To this end, CMS has <br/>
retired the current standard (NCPDP SCRIPT version 10.6) for e-RX and MH and adopted <br/>
NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 as the standard for Part D e-Rx and MH effective January 1, 2020, <br/>
conditional on ONC updating the Program to the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard for its e-Rx <br/>
certification criterion (<i>see also </i>42 CFR 423.160(b)(1)(v) and (2)(iv)). In addition, CMS recently <br/>
sought comment regarding whether the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard could facilitate <br/>
future reporting of the proposed Query of Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) <br/>
measure in both the 2019 Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule (83 FR 35923) and Hospital <br/>
Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems (IPPS) Fiscal Year 2019 proposed rule (83 FR 20528). <br/>
As summarized in the IPPS Fiscal Year 2019 final rule (83 FR 41144), CMS received comments <br/>
supportive of using the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 medication history transactions for PDMP <br/>
queries and responses, as well as comments asking CMS to seek harmonizing of the 2015 <br/>
Edition e-prescribing certification criterion to the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard specified <br/>
in the part D program portions of the recent &#34;Medicare Program; Contract Year 2019 Policy and <br/>
Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Cost Plan, Medicare Fee-for-Service, <br/>
the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs, and the PACE Program&#34; final rule (83 FR <br/>

In addition to proposing to adopt the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard for the transactions <br/>
that are listed in the current “electronic prescribing” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(3)), we propose to <br/>
adopt and require conformance to all of the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard transactions <br/>
CMS adopted at 42 CFR 423.160(b)(2)(iv) for NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071. Therefore, we propose <br/>
to adopt a new 2015 Edition “electronic prescribing” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(11)) that includes <br/>
the following transactions:   <br/>
•  <b>Create new prescriptions (NewRx, NewRxRequest, NewRxResponseDenied) </b><br/>
A NewRx transaction is a new prescription from a prescriber to a pharmacy so that it can <br/>
be dispensed to a patient. A NewRxRequest is a request from a pharmacy to a prescriber for a <br/>
new prescription for a patient. A NewRxResponseDenied is a denied response to a previously <br/>
sent NewRxRequest (if approved, a NewRx would be sent). A NewRxResponseDenied response <br/>
may occur when the NewRxRequest cannot be processed or if information is unavailable. <br/>
•  <b>Change prescriptions (RxChangeRequest, RxChangeResponse) </b><br/>
An RxChangeRequest transaction originates from a pharmacy to request: a change in the <br/>
original prescription (new or fillable), validation of prescriber credentials, a prescriber to review <br/>
the drug requested, or a prior authorization from the payer for the prescription. An <br/>
RxChangeResponse transaction originates from a prescriber to respond: to a prescription change <br/>
request from a pharmacy, to a request for a prior authorization from a pharmacy, or to a <br/>
prescriber credential validation request from a pharmacy.  <br/>
•  <b>Cancel prescriptions (CancelRx, CancelRxResponse) </b><br/>
A CancelRx transaction is a request from a prescriber to a pharmacy to not fill a <br/>
previously sent prescription. A CancelRx must contain pertinent information for the pharmacy to <br/>

be able to find the prescription in their system (patient, medication (name, strength, dosage, <br/>
form), prescriber, prescription number if available). A CancelRxResponse is a response from a <br/>
pharmacy to a prescriber to acknowledge a CancelRx, and is used to denote if the cancellation is <br/>
Approved or Denied.  <br/>
•  <b>Renew prescriptions (RxRenewalRequest, RxRenewalResponse)</b> <br/>
An RxRenewalRequest transaction originates from a pharmacy to request additional <br/>
refills beyond those originally prescribed. RxRenewalResponse originates from a prescriber to <br/>
respond to the request. <b> </b><br/>
•  <b>Receive fill status notifications (RxFill, RxFillIndicatorChange) </b><br/>
An RxFill transaction is sent from a pharmacy to a prescriber or a long term or post-acute <br/>
care (LTPAC) facility indicating the FillStatus (dispensed, partially dispensed, not dispensed or <br/>
returned to stock, transferred to another pharmacy) of the new, refill, or resupply prescriptions <br/>
for a patient. RxFillIndicator informs the pharmacy of the prescriber’s intent for fill status <br/>
notifications for a specific patient/medication. An RxFillIndicatorChange is sent by a prescriber <br/>
to a pharmacy to indicate that the prescriber is changing the types of RxFill transactions that <br/>
were previously requested, where the prescriber may modify the fill status of transactions <br/>
previously selected or cancel future RxFill transactions.  <br/>
•  <b>Request and receive medication history (RxHistoryRequest, RxHistoryResponse)</b> <br/>
An RxHistoryRequest transaction is a request from a prescriber for a list of medications <br/>
that have been prescribed, dispensed, claimed, or indicated by a patient. This request could be <br/>
sent to a state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP). An RxHistoryResponse is a <br/>
response to an RxHistoryRequest containing a patient’s medication history. It includes the <br/>

•  <b>Ask the Mailbox if there are any transactions (GetMessage) </b><br/>
This transaction is used by the prescriber or pharmacy asking the mailbox if there are any <br/>
transactions. It is at the heart of the mechanism used by a pharmacy or prescriber system to <br/>
receive transactions from each other or from a payer or the REMS Administrator via a Switch, <br/>

•  <b>Respond that there was a problem with the transaction (Error)</b> <br/>
This transaction indicates an error has occurred, indicating the request was terminated. <br/>
An Error can be generated when there is a communication problem or when the transaction <br/>
actually had an error. An error can be mailboxed, as it may be signifying to the originator that a <br/>
transaction was unable to be delivered or encountered problems in the acceptance. The Error <br/>
must be a different response than a Status, since the communication between the system and the <br/>
Mailbox must clearly denote the actions taking place. An Error is a response being delivered on <br/>
behalf of a previous transaction, and the Status signifies no more mail. <br/>

This transaction is a response to a pharmacy or prescriber indicating that a transaction <br/>
requesting a return receipt has been received. Verifications results when a “return receipt <br/>
requested” flag is set in the original request. Upon receiving a transaction with ReturnReceipt <br/>
set, it is the responsibility of the receiver to either generate a Verify in response to the request <br/>
(recommended) or generate a Status in response to this request, followed subsequently by a free <br/>
standing Verify. This transaction notifies the originator that the transaction was received at the <br/>
software system. It is not a notification of action taking place, since time may elapse before the <br/>
ultimate answer to the transaction may take place. <br/>
•  <b>Request to send an additional supply of medication (Resupply)</b> <br/>
This transaction is a request from a Long Term or Post-Acute Care (LTPAC) <br/>
organization to a pharmacy to send an additional supply of medication for an existing order. An <br/>
example use case is when a medication supply for a resident is running low (2-3 doses) and a <br/>
new supply is needed from the pharmacy, the LTPAC organization need a way to notify the <br/>
pharmacy that an additional supply for the medication is needed. <br/>
•  <b>Communicate drug administration events (DrugAdministration)</b> <br/>
This transaction communicates drug administration events from a prescriber/care facility <br/>
to the pharmacy or other entity. It is a notification from a prescriber/care facility to a pharmacy <br/>
or other entity that a drug administration event has occurred - for example, a medication was <br/>
suspended or administration was resumed.<b> </b><br/>

The RxTransferRequest transaction is used when the pharmacy is asking for a transfer of <br/>
one or more prescriptions for a specific patient to the requesting pharmacy. The <br/>
RxTransferResponse transaction is the response to the RxTransferRequest which includes the <br/>
prescription(s) being transferred or a rejection of the transfer request. It is sent from the <br/>
transferring pharmacy to the requesting pharmacy. The RxTransferConfirm transaction is used <br/>
by the pharmacy receiving (originally requesting) the transfer to confirm that the transfer <br/>
prescription has been received and the transfer is complete. <br/>
•  <b>Recertify the continued administration of a medication order (Recertification)</b> <br/>
This transaction is a notification from a facility, on behalf of a prescriber, to a pharmacy <br/>
recertifying the continued administration of a medication order. An example use is when an <br/>
existing medication order has been recertified by the prescriber for continued use. Long term or <br/>
post-acute care use only. <br/>

With CMS’ recent adoption of these transactions in their recently issued final rule <br/>

believe that it would be equally beneficial to include these four REMS transactions as part of this <br/>
proposed certification criterion: REMSInitiationRequest, REMSInitiationResponse, <br/>
REMSRequest, and REMSResponse. <br/>

pharmaceutical manufacturer if the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure the <br/>
benefits of a drug outweigh the risks associated with the drug. The currently approved REMS <br/>
programs vary in levels of complexity. Typically a Med Guide and Communication Plan is <br/>
required, but some also require Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU). The large majority of <br/>
existing REMS programs are for drugs dispensed through specialty pharmacies, clinics, and <br/>
hospitals, but as REMS become more common they may ultimately have a greater impact on <br/>
retail-based products.  <br/>
The impact of REMS is twofold. First, REMS with ETASU may require the pharmacist <br/>
to verify prescriber, patient, and/or pharmacy enrollment in a registry and, in some cases, verify <br/>
or check certain information, such as lab results. Second, all REMS, including those without <br/>
ETASU, must fulfill FDA-approved reporting requirements. Each REMS program must also <br/>
include a program assessment schedule that examines the program’s effectiveness on intervals <br/>
approved by the FDA as part of the overall REMS program. The results of these assessments are <br/>
submitted to the FDA as part of the ongoing evaluation of REMS program effectiveness. <br/>
Accordingly, we propose to include the REMS transactions as part of this proposed certification <br/>
criterion. We would also note for commenters’ benefit that the SCRIPT 2017071 testing tool <br/>
under development is being designed to support testing these REMS transactions. <br/>
We believe that removing the 2015 Edition certification criterion (codified in § <br/>
170.315(b)(3)) that references NCPDP SCRIPT version 10.6 and replacing it with an updated e-<br/>
prescribing criterion (proposed to be codified in § 170.315(b)(11)) would harmonize with <br/>
relevant CMS program timelines, including Part D e-prescribing requirements and the option for <br/>
eligible clinicians, hospitals, and CAHs to report on the Query of Prescription Drug Monitoring <br/>

Program (PDMP) quality measure for Promoting Interoperability Programs. However, should <br/>
our proposal to adopt the new e-prescribing criterion (§ 170.315(b)(11)) be finalized prior to <br/>
January 1, 2020, we also propose to permit continued certification to the current 2015 Edition <br/>
“electronic prescribing” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(3)) for the period of time in which it would <br/>
continue to be used as a program standard in the CMS Medicare Part D Program or the CMS <br/>
Promoting Interoperability Programs. Once it is no longer used in those Programs, we would no <br/>
longer permit certification to that and would remove it from the Code of Federal Regulations. <br/>
We will consider setting an effective date for such actions in a subsequent final rule based on <br/>
stakeholder feedback and CMS policies at the time. To this point, we note that the continued <br/>
acceptability of a Health IT Module certified to the criterion codified in § 170.315(b)(3) for <br/>
purposes of meeting the CEHRT definition and participating in the CMS Promoting <br/>
Interoperability Programs would be a matter of CMS policy. <br/>
3. Clinical Quality Measures – Report Criterion <br/>
 <br/>
In the 2015 Edition final rule, ONC adopted four clinical quality measure (CQM) <br/>
certification criteria, § 170.315(c)(1) CQMs – record and export, § 170.315(c)(2) CQMs – <br/>
import and calculate, § 170.315(c)(3) CQMs – report, and § 170.315(c)(4) CQMs – filter (80 FR <br/>
62649-62655). These four criteria were adopted with the intent to support providers’ quality <br/>
improvement activities and in electronically generating CQM reports for reporting with certified <br/>
health IT to programs such as the EHR Incentive Programs, Quality Payment Program, and <br/>
Comprehensive Primary Care plus initiative. All four CQM criteria require certified health IT to <br/>
be capable of generating CQM reports using the HL7 Quality Reporting Document Architecture <br/>
(QRDA) Category I standard, which provides CQM reports for individual patients. Specifically, <br/>

Architecture – Category I (QRDA I); Release 1, Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU) Release 3 <br/>

170.315(c)(3)) and CQMs – filter (§ 170.315(c)(4)), also require certified health IT to be capable <br/>
of generating CQM reports using the QRDA Category III standard, which provides aggregate <br/>
CQM reports for a set of patients. More specifically, we adopted QRDA Category III, <br/>
Implementation Guide for CDA Release 2 (§ 170.205(k)(1)) and the Errata to the HL7 <br/>
Implementation Guide for CDA® Release 2: QRDA Category III, DSTU Release 1 (US Realm), <br/>

 <br/>
The “CQMs – report” certification criterion (§ 170.315(c)(3)) includes an optional <br/>
certification provision for demonstrating that the health IT can create QRDA reports in the form <br/>
and manner required for submission to CMS programs, which is in accordance with CMS’ <br/>
QRDA Implementation Guide (IGs).<a href="ONCs.html#86">23</a> The CMS QRDA IGs include specific requirements to <br/>
support providers participating in CMS programs in addition to the HL7 IGs. At the time of the <br/>
finalization of the 2015 Edition final rule and in response to public comment, we noted that there <br/>
was mixed feedback on whether this criterion should require adherence to the HL7 QRDA <br/>
Category I and Category III standards or solely to the CMS QRDA IGs. As such, we adopted an <br/>
approach that allowed for flexibility and only required that certified health IT support the HL7 <br/>
QRDA standards, which are program-agnostic and can support a number of use cases for <br/>
exchanging CQM data. Because the criterion has the optional provision for CMS program-<br/>
specific certification, developers can also support their end-users who intend to use their certified <br/>

health IT to report eCQMs to CMS in the “form and manner” CMS requires (i.e., using the <br/>
format specified in the CMS QRDA IGs) (80 FR 62652). <br/>
 <br/>
Since the 2015 Edition final rule was published (October 16, 2015), we have gained <br/>
additional certification experience and received feedback from the industry that health IT <br/>
certified to the “CQMs-report” criterion (§ 170.315(c)(3)) are only/primarily being used to <br/>
submit eCQMs to CMS for participation in CMS programs. Therefore, as a means of reducing <br/>
burden, we propose to remove the HL7 QRDA standard requirements from the 2015 Edition <br/>
CQMs – report criterion in § 170.315(c)(3), but <i>require</i> that health IT certified to the criterion <br/>
support the CMS QRDA IGs. This would directly reduce burden on health IT developers and <br/>
indirectly providers as they would no longer have to, in practice, develop (health IT developers) <br/>
and support (both developers and providers) two forms of the QRDA standard (i.e., the HL7 and <br/>
CMS forms). We note that the Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard offers the <br/>
potential for supporting quality improvement and reporting needs and promises to be a more <br/>
efficient, modular, and interoperable standard to develop, implement, and utilize through APIs. <br/>
However, until the potential benefits of FHIR APIs can be realized for quality improvement and <br/>
reporting, we believe that solely requiring the CMS QRDA IGs for the “CQMs – report” <br/>
criterion balances the burden to developers and providers, while still meeting the goal of <br/>
facilitating quality improvement and reporting to CMS. <br/>
To support the proposal, we propose to incorporate by reference the latest annual CMS <br/>
QRDA IGs, specifically the 2019 CMS QRDA I Implementation Guide for Hospital Quality <br/>

provide flexibility to providers. However, we solicit comment on whether we should consider an <br/>

which the product is designed and implemented. We also solicit comment on the future <br/>
possibility of FHIR-enabled APIs replacing or complementing QRDA reports for quality <br/>
reporting and improvement. <br/>
If we finalize this proposal in a subsequent final rule, we propose to adopt the latest CMS <br/>
QRDA IGs at the time of final rule publication, as CMS updates their QRDA IGs annually to <br/>
support the latest eCQM specifications and only accepts eCQM reporting to the latest version. <br/>
We note that this approach would also facilitate a means for ONC to permit developers to update <br/>
its certified health IT to newer versions of the CMS QRDA IGs through the real world testing <br/>
Maintenance of Certification provision for standards and implementation specification updates in <br/>
support of ongoing interoperability (<i>see</i> section VII.B.5 of this proposed rule). <br/>
4. Electronic Health Information Export <br/>
We propose to adopt a new 2015 Edition certification criterion for EHI export in §<b> </b><br/>
170.315(b)(10). This criterion is intended to provide patients and health IT users with a means to <br/>
efficiently export the entire electronic health record for a single patient or all patients in a <br/>
computable, electronic format, and facilitate the receiving health IT system’s interpretation and <br/>
use of the EHI, to the extent reasonably practicable using the developer’s existing technology. <br/>

This outcome would promote access, exchange, and use of EHI and facilitate health care <br/>
providers’ ability to switch health IT systems or to migrate EHI for use in other technologies. <br/>
Additionally, as discussed in section VII.B.2 of this preamble, certification to this criterion <br/>
would provide some degree of assurance that a health IT developer supports, and does not <br/>
inhibit, the access, exchange, and use of EHI for the specific use cases that the criterion <br/>
addresses.  <br/>
This proposed criterion supports two specific use cases for which we believe that all EHI <br/>
produced and electronically managed in a developer’s technology should be made readily <br/>
available for export as a standard capability of certified health IT.  <br/>
First, we propose that health IT certified to this criterion would have to enable the export <br/>
of EHI for a single patient upon a valid request from that patient or a user on the patient’s behalf. <br/>
This patient-focused export capability, which is discussed in more detail below, complements <br/>
other provisions of this proposed rule that support patients’ access to their EHI including <br/>
information that may eventually be accessible via the APIs described in section VII.B.4 of this <br/>
preamble. Ultimately, we expect all data to be transferred through APIs or other advanced <br/>
technologies. EHI export also supports longitudinal data record development, and aligns with <br/>
section 4006(a) of the Cures Act, which requires [t]he Secretary, in consultation with the <br/>
National Coordinator, [to] promote policies that ensure that a patient’s EHI is accessible to that <br/>
patient and the patient’s designees, in a manner that facilitates communication with the patient’s <br/>
health care providers and other individuals, including researchers, consistent with such patient’s <br/>
consent.  <br/>

 <br/>
Second, this criterion would support the export of EHI when a health care provider <br/>
chooses to transition or migrate information to another health IT system. As discussed in section <br/>
VIII.C.5.c.iii of this preamble, health IT developers are in a unique position to block the export <br/>
and portability of data for use in competing systems or applications, or to charge rents for access <br/>
to the basic technical information needed to facilitate the conversion or migration of data for <br/>
these purposes. By providing at least a baseline capability for exporting EHI in a commercially <br/>
reasonable format, we believe that this criterion would help to address some of these business <br/>
practices and enable smoother transitions between health IT systems.  <br/>
This criterion is intended to further the two use cases outlined above while providing an <br/>
incremental approach given the known and anticipated health IT landscape when ONC expects <br/>
certified health IT with this functionality will be widely available in the ecosystem. At the time <br/>
of this rulemaking, we believe a focused certification criterion that is standards-agnostic will <br/>
provide a useful first step to enabling patients to request and receive their EHI and for providers <br/>
to more readily switch or migrate information between health IT systems. Understanding that <br/>
open, standards-based APIs are an emerging technology and that some health IT developers <br/>
today have implemented proprietary APIs, this proposed criterion for EHI export provides an <br/>
initial method for exporting patient health information in these circumstances. Over time, ONC <br/>
may consider expanding the proposed criterion or replacing it to achieve the goals in §<b> </b>170.402. <br/>
It is also possible that in the future, this criterion will no longer be needed once standards-based <br/>
APIs are widely available in the health IT ecosystem with the ability to facilitate exchange of a <br/>
wider set of standardized data elements per the predictable, transparent, and collaborative <br/>

a. Patient Access <br/>
 <br/>
As noted above, the export functionality required by this certification criterion would <br/>
support both a patient’s access to their EHI and a provider’s ability to switch to another health IT <br/>
system. In the patient access context, we propose that a user must be able to timely execute the <br/>
single patient EHI export at any time the user chooses and without subsequent developer <br/>
assistance to operate. The health IT developer should enable the user to make data requests and <br/>
receive the export efficiently, without unreasonable burden. For example, the health IT developer <br/>
should not: require the user to make a request multiple times for different types of EHI; provide <br/>
unreasonable delays for the export; or prohibit reasonable user access to the system during the <br/>
export process.  <br/>
“Timely” does not mean real-time; however, we stress that any delays in providing the <br/>
export must be no longer than reasonably necessary to avoid interference with other clinical <br/>
functions of the health IT system. This is similar to the approach we have taken for export of <br/>
clinical quality measure data. The export capability does not require that data be received <br/>
instantaneously. Rather, as we have stated before (80 FR 62650) a non-conformity would exist if <br/>
surveillance revealed that processing or other delays were likely to substantially interfere with <br/>

all required outcomes, health IT developers should seek to minimize processing times and other <br/>
delays to the greatest extent possible.<a href="ONCs.html#92">26  </a>   <br/>
As previously defined under the Program, “user” is a health care professional or his or <br/>
her office staff; or a software program or service that would interact directly with the certified <br/>
health IT (80 FR 62611, 77 FR 54168). We typically would expect the “user” in this case to be a <br/>
provider or his or her office staff who will be performing the request on behalf of the patient <br/>
given that a request of this nature would likely occur in the context of an individual exercising <br/>
their right of access under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164.524). In this regard, the <br/>
proposed 2015 Edition “EHI export” criterion could facilitate and support the provision of a <br/>
patient’s record in an electronic format. In service to innovative and patient-centric approaches, a <br/>
health IT developer could develop a method that allows the patient using a technology <br/>
application (e.g., portal or “app”) to execute the request without needing a provider to do so on <br/>
their behalf. We seek comment on whether this portion of the criterion should be made more <br/>
prescriptive to <i>only</i> allow the patient and his or her authorized representative to be the requestor <br/>
of their EHI, similar to how we have previously scoped such criteria as “view, download, and <br/>
transmit to 3rd party” (§<b> </b>170.315(e)(1)). <br/>
Similar to the 2015 Edition “data export” certification criterion (<b>§ </b>170.315(b)(6)), which <br/>
we propose for removal below, we acknowledge potential privacy and security concerns may <br/>
arise when EHI is exported and, therefore, propose that for provider-mediated requests, a <br/>
developer may design the health IT to limit the type of users that would be able to access and <br/>
initiate EHI export functions. However, as we previously specified in the 2015 Edition final rule, <br/>

the ability to “limit” the single patient EHI export functionality is intended to be used by and at <br/>
the discretion of the provider organization implementing the technology, not a way for health IT <br/>
developers to implicitly prevent the overarching user-driven aspect of this capability (80 FR <br/>
62646).  <br/>
b. Transitions Between Health IT Systems  <br/>
In addition to and separate from the patient access use case described above, health IT <br/>
certified to this criterion would facilitate the migration of EHI to another health IT system. We <br/>
propose that a health IT developer of health IT certified to this criterion must, at a customer’s <br/>
request, provide a complete export of all EHI that is produced or managed by means of the <br/>
developer’s certified health IT. Health IT developers would have flexibility as to how this <br/>
outcome is achieved, so long as a customer is able to receive the export in a timely and efficient <br/>
manner, and in a format that is commercially reasonable. For example, in contrast with the <br/>
patient export capability, which must be available to a user without subsequent developer <br/>
assistance to operate, the “database export” capability of this criterion could require action or <br/>
support on the part of the health IT developer.  <br/>
We note that while this criterion focuses on the technical outcomes supported by this <br/>
capability, developers of health IT certified to this criterion would be required to provide the <br/>
assurances proposed in § 170.402, which include providing reasonable cooperation and <br/>
assistance to other persons (including customers, users, and third-party developers) to enable the <br/>
use of interoperable products and services. Thus, while developers would have flexibility as to <br/>
how they implement the export functionality for transitions between systems, they would <br/>
ultimately be responsible for ensuring that the capability is deployed in a way that enables a <br/>

customer and their third-party contractors to successfully migrate data. Such cooperation and <br/>
assistance could include, for example, assisting a customer’s third-party developer to automate <br/>
the export of EHI to other systems. We refer readers to section VII.B.2 of the proposed rule for <br/>
further discussion of a health IT developer’s assurances as proposed in § 170.402.  <br/>
c. Scope of EHI <br/>
For both use cases supported by this criterion, EHI export encompasses all the EHI that <br/>
the health IT system produces and electronically manages for a patient or group of patients. This <br/>
applies to the health IT’s entire database, including but not limited to clinical, administrative, and <br/>
claims/billing data. It would also include any data that may be stored in separate data warehouses <br/>
that the system has access to, can produce, and electronically manages. For example, health IT <br/>
developers may store EHI in these warehouses to prevent performance impacts from data queries <br/>
that may slow down the “main” health IT system’s (e.g., EHR) clinical performance. We clarify <br/>
that “EHI” also includes the oldest EHI available on that patient to the most recent, no matter the <br/>
specific electronic format (e.g., PDFs are included). As mentioned above, our intention is that <br/>
“produces and electronically manages” refers to a health IT product’s entire database. However, <br/>
we seek comment on the terminology used (“produces and electronically manages”) and whether <br/>
that captures our intent or whether there are any alternatives to the language we should consider <br/>
to further clarify our intent. Alternative language we considered included “produce and <br/>
electronically retain” data, which could encompass more data.  <br/>
The use of the term “electronic health information” (EHI) is deliberate and in alignment <br/>
with the Cures Act and the proposed definition of this term in §<b> </b>170.102. Its use supports <br/>
consistency and the breadth of types of data envisioned by this criterion. Clinical data would <br/>

encompass imaging information – both images and narrative text about the image – as this is part <br/>
of the patient’s total record; however, we understand that EHRs may not be the standard storage <br/>
location for images and solicit comment on the feasibility, practicality, and necessity of <br/>
exporting images and/or imaging information. We request comment on what image elements, at <br/>
a minimum, should be shared such as image quality, type, and narrative text. It is understandable <br/>
that developers will not be able to export every existing data element, nor that all possible data <br/>
elements are necessary for transfer. For finalization in a subsequent final rule, we solicit <br/>
comment on whether we should require, to support transparency, health IT developers to attest or <br/>
publish as part of the export format documentation the types of EHI they cannot support for <br/>
export. <br/>
We also propose the following metadata categories that would be excluded from this <br/>
criterion, and have listed examples for clarity below. We seek comment on these exclusion <br/>
categories, and request feedback on what metadata elements should remain included for export, <br/>
or be added to the list of data that would be allowed to be excluded in a subsequent final rule:  <br/>
•  Metadata present in internal databases used for physically storing the data. Examples include: <br/>
internal database table names, field names, schema, constraints, Triggers, Field size (number <br/>
of bytes), Field type (String, integer, double, long), and Primary keys or object identifiers <br/>
used internally for querying.  <br/>
•  Metadata that may not be necessary to interpret EHI export, including information that is <br/>
typically required for processing of transactions such as encryption keys, internal user roles, <br/>
ancillary information such as information stored in different formats, local codes for internal <br/>
use; audit logs, record reviews, or history of change. <br/>

•  Metadata that refers to data that is not present in the EHI export, such as links to files and <br/>
other external attachments that are not part of the export, and information used in conjunction <br/>
with data from other applications that is not part of the health IT. <br/>
We also seek comment, for consideration in finalizing this criterion in a subsequent final <br/>
rule, on types of EHI that may present challenges for meeting the intent of this proposed <br/>
criterion. <br/>
d. Export Format <br/>
The proposed certification criterion does not prescribe a content standard for the EHI <br/>
export. However, it requires health IT developers to provide the format, such as a data dictionary <br/>
or export support file, for the exported information to assist the receiving system in processing <br/>
the EHI without loss of information or its meaning to the extent reasonably practicable using the <br/>
developer’s existing technology. Providing EHI export information is consistent with emerging <br/>
industry practices and capabilities to offer requestors the ability to access, download, and move <br/>
their information without unreasonable burden. Companies such as Facebook,<a href="ONCs.html#96">27 </a>Google,<a href="ONCs.html#96">28 </a>and <br/>
Twitter<a href="ONCs.html#96">29</a> offer publicly-available links which provide requestors necessary information on how <br/>
to download their personal information including, in some cases, several download options for <br/>
requestors alongside their export instructions. Public access to comparable EHI export <br/>
information would further support third-party companies in this space, as they would have <br/>
additional information and general knowledge for use of available data. Accordingly, we propose <br/>
that the developer’s export format should be made publicly available via a hyperlink as part of <br/>

 <br/>
certification to the “EHI export” criterion, including keeping the hyperlink up-to-date with the <br/>
current export format.  <br/>
We believe that by making the export format publicly available at the time of certification <br/>
(and keeping the information current) will stimulate a vibrant, competitive market in which third-<br/>
party software developers can specialize in processing the data exported from certified health IT <br/>
products in support of patients and providers. Moreover, we believe this proposal will transform <br/>
today’s current guess-work, one-off processes into something more predictable and transparent <br/>
such that greater industry efficiencies can be realized. We note and clarify that the export format <br/>
need not be the same format used internally by the health IT system, and the health IT developer <br/>
would not need to make public their proprietary data model. The proposed certification criterion <br/>
also does not prescribe how the exported EHI is made available to the user, as this may depend <br/>
on the size and type of information. We would expect that the information be made available to <br/>
the user or requestor in an acceptable manner without placing unreasonable burden on the user or <br/>
requestor. Please also generally see our discussion of information blocking in section VIII and <br/>
particularly section VIII.D.5. <br/>
e. Initial Step to Persistent Access to All of a Patient’s EHI <br/>
We believe that open, standards-based APIs should provide persistent access to patients’ <br/>
EHI over time to achieve the envisioned goals in §<b> </b>170.404. In the meantime, this proposed <br/>
criterion in §<b> </b>170.315(b)(10) will provide an initial step toward achieving those goals. We clarify <br/>
that “persistent” or “continuous” access to EHI is not required to satisfy this criterion’s <br/>
requirements and that the minimum requirement is for a discrete data export capability. <br/>
Similarly, while the criterion requires the timely export of all EHI, such export need not occur <br/>

instantaneously (or in “real-time”). However, health IT developers are encouraged to consider <br/>
persistent access and real-time approaches as part of the step-wise progression we see towards <br/>
open, standards-based APIs for a growing number of data elements per the USCDI in the <br/>
proposed “standardized API for patient and population services” criterion (§<b> </b>170.315(g)(10).” <br/>
Further, we caution that where it is reasonable for a developer to provide persistent or real-time <br/>
access to electronic health information, the refusal to do so may be inconsistent with the <br/>
Conditions of Certification in § 170.401 (information blocking) and § 170.402 (assurances <br/>
related to this capability), as well as the information blocking provision, as to which readers <br/>
should refer to sections VII and VIII of this proposed rule. Similarly, while this certification <br/>
criterion would provide a baseline capability for exporting data for the specific use cases <br/>
described above, health IT developers may need to provide other data export and conversion <br/>
services or support additional export use cases beyond those encompassed by this criterion to <br/>
facilitate the appropriate access, exchange, and use of electronic health information and to avoid <br/>
engaging in information blocking.  <br/>
f. Timeframes  <br/>
ONC seeks input on EHI export and timeframes. In particular, beyond exporting <br/>
<i>all</i> the EHI the health IT system produces and electronically manages, should this <br/>
criterion include capabilities to permit health care providers to set timeframes for EHI <br/>
export, such as only the “past two years” or “past month” of EHI? <br/>

g.  Replaces the 2015 Edition “Data Export” Criterion in the 2015 Edition Base <br/>
EHR Definition <br/>
We propose to remove the “data export” criterion (§<b> </b>170.315(b)(6)) from the 2015 <br/>
Edition, including the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition expressed in § 170.102. <br/>
Correspondingly, we propose to include the proposed “EHI export” criterion (§<b> </b>170.315(b)(10)) <br/>
in the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition, which would affect health care providers’ compliance <br/>
responsibilities when it comes to possessing CEHRT for associated CMS programs. A specific <br/>
C-CDA data export criterion no longer supports advancements in interoperability in the evolving <br/>
health IT industry. The proposed “EHI export” certification criterion is standards-agnostic and <br/>
supports a more open approach to interoperability. More specifically, the proposed “EHI export” <br/>
criterion differs significantly from the “data export” certification criterion as the latter is limited <br/>
to clinical data as specified in the C-CDA. Also, the proposed “EHI export” criterion is not <br/>
limited to just the scope of the certified capabilities in the certified Health IT Module as it <br/>
applies to all produced and electronically managed EHI. Further, by including this functionality <br/>
in the 2015 Base EHR definition, we can be assured that health care providers participating in <br/>
the CMS programs (e.g., Promoting Interoperability Programs) have functionality to both <br/>
support patient requests for their EHI and switching health IT systems.  <br/>
We propose to modify the Base EHR definition to include the proposed “EHI export” <br/>
criterion 24 months from the effective date of the final rule for this proposed rule (which <br/>
practically speaking would be 25 months because of the 30-day delayed effective date). We <br/>

 <br/>
believe this is sufficient time for health IT developers to develop, test, certify, and rollout this <br/>
functionality to health care providers based on the flexible approach offered for meeting this <br/>
criterion. We also believe this timeframe provides sufficient time for health care providers to <br/>
adopt and implement the functionality included in the “EHI export” criterion. To note, we refer <br/>
readers to the “Assurances” Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements in section <br/>
VII.B.2, which propose complementary requirements on health IT developers to rollout health IT <br/>
certified “EHI export” within 24 months of the effective date of a final rule for this proposed <br/>
rule. We welcome comments on our proposed compliance timeline. <br/>
We note that we do not propose a transition period for the “data export” criterion. We <br/>
propose to remove the criterion from the 2015 Edition upon the effective date of a final rule for <br/>
this proposed rule. Unlike the “application access – data category request” criterion (which we <br/>
propose to replace with the new API criterion in this proposed rule), the “data export” criterion <br/>
does not support an objective or measure under the CMS Promoting Interoperability Programs. <br/>
Therefore, we do not believe that health IT developers and health care providers need to support <br/>
the functionality in the “data export” criterion while they transition to the development, adoption, <br/>
and implementation of the EHI export criterion. This approach should reduce burden and costs <br/>
for both health IT developers and health care providers. We welcome comments on this <br/>
approach, including whether this will leave health care providers without an export capability for <br/>
an inordinate period of time such that we should require health IT developers to support the “data <br/>
export” functionality for health care providers until the health IT developer attests to providing <br/>
the new EHI export functionality to all of its customers.   <br/>

5. Standardized API for Patient and Population Services Criterion <br/>
To implement the Cures Act, we propose to adopt a new API criterion in § <br/>
170.315(g)(10), which would replace the “application access – data category request” <br/>
certification criterion (§ 170.315(g)(8)) and become part of the 2015 Edition Base EHR <br/>
definition. This new certification criterion would require the use of FHIR standards, several <br/>
implementation specifications, and focus on supporting two types of API-enabled services: (1) <br/>
services for which a single patient’s data is at focus; and (2) services for which multiple patients’ <br/>
data are at focus. Please refer to the “Application Programming Interfaces” section (VII.B.4) in <br/>

Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements. <br/>
6. Privacy and Security Transparency Attestations <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
a. Background <br/>
In 2015, the HIT Standards Committee (HITSC) recommended the adoption of two new <br/>
certification criteria for the Program. The National Coordinator endorsed the HITSC <br/>
recommendations for consideration by the Secretary, and the Secretary determined that it was <br/>
appropriate to propose adoption of the two new certification criteria through rulemaking (81 FR <br/>
10635). To implement the Secretary’s determination, we propose to add two new 2015 Edition <br/>
privacy and security “transparency attestation” certification criteria for: (1) encrypt <br/>
authentication credentials; and (2) multi-factor authentication. <br/>

 <br/>
In the 2015 Edition final rule, we adopted a new, simpler, and straightforward approach <br/>
to privacy and security (P&amp;S) certification requirements for Health IT Modules certified to the <br/>
2015 Edition, which we refer to as the 2015 Edition privacy and security certification framework <br/>
(80 FR 62705). In this proposed rule, we propose modifications to the 2015 Edition privacy and <br/>
security certification framework in § 170.550(h) and propose to add new criteria to which a <br/>
health IT developer would need to certify pertaining to whether or not its product encrypts <br/>
authentication credentials (specifically § 170.315(d)(12)) and supports multi-factor <br/>
authentication (specifically § 170.315(d)(13)). To be clear, we are not proposing to require that <br/>
health IT <i>have</i> the functionality present to encrypt authentication credentials or support multi-<br/>
factor authentication. Rather, we propose that a health IT developer indicate whether or not their <br/>
certified health IT has those capabilities by attesting yes or no. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
b. Encrypt Authentication Credentials <br/>
We propose to adopt an “encrypt authentication credentials” certification criterion in § <br/>
170.315(d)(12) and include it in the P&amp;S certification framework (§ 170.550(h)). We propose to <br/>
make the encrypt authentication credentials certification criterion applicable to any Health IT <br/>
Module currently certified to the 2015 Edition and any Health IT Module presented for <br/>
certification due to the fact that all health IT must meet the “authentication, access control, and <br/>
authorization” certification criterion adopted in § 170.315(d)(1) as part of current Program <br/>
requirements. While the 2015 Edition “authentication, access control, and authorization” <br/>
certification criterion criteria requires that patient information saved on end user devices is <br/>
encrypted, those same protections are not explicitly required through certification for the <br/>
authentication credentials<i> </i>used to access that same information. As such, we believe that this <br/>

 <br/>
proposal would address that gap and encourage health IT developers to take steps to ensure that <br/>
authentication credentials are protected consistent with industry best practices.  <br/>
To provide clarity as to what a “yes” attestation for “encrypt authentication credentials” <br/>
would mean, we provide the following explanation. Encrypting authentication credentials could <br/>
include password encryption or cryptographic hashing, which is storing only encrypted or <br/>
cryptographically hashed passwords. If a developer attests that its Health IT Module encrypts <br/>
authentication credentials, we propose that the attestation would mean that the Health IT Module <br/>
is capable of cryptographically protecting stored authentication credentials in accordance with <br/>
standards adopted in § 170.210(a)(2), Annex A: Federal Information Processing Standards <br/>
(FIPS) Publication 140-2, Approved Security Functions for FIPS PUB 140-2, Security <br/>
Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. We posit that FIPS Publication 140-2 is the seminal, <br/>
comprehensive, and most appropriate standard. Moreover, in the specified FIPS 140-2 standard, <br/>
there is an allowance for various approved encryption methods, and health IT developers would <br/>
have the flexibility to implement any of the approved encryption methods in order to attest yes to <br/>
this criterion. Health IT developers should keep apprised of these standards as they evolve and <br/>
are updated to address vulnerabilities identified in the current standard. <br/>
We do not believe it is necessary for a Health IT Module to be required to be tested to <br/>
this criterion, so long as by attesting yes to this criterion, the health IT developer is attesting that <br/>
if authentication credentials are stored, then the authentication credentials are protected <br/>
consistent with the requirements above. To be clear, a “no” attestation is a sufficient response to <br/>
address this certification criterion; however, health IT developers should be aware that this “no” <br/>
will be made publicly available on the CHPL. Note that if a developer attested to encrypting <br/>

authentication credentials, a certified Health IT Module would be subject to ONC-ACB <br/>
surveillance for any potential non-conformity with the requirements of this criterion. <br/>
Specifically, if the ONC-ACB becomes aware of situations where the developer’s health IT is <br/>
not meeting the developer’s affirmative attestation per the criterion’s requirements, the ONC-<br/>
ACB may use its corrective action process to bring the product back into conformance.  <br/>
We propose that, for health IT certified prior to a subsequent final rule’s effective date, <br/>
the health IT would need to be certified to the “encrypt authentication credentials” certification <br/>
criterion within six months after the final rule’s effective date. For health IT certified for the first <br/>
time after the final rule’s effective date, we propose that the health IT must meet this criterion at <br/>
the time of certification. This should allow sufficient time for health IT developers to assess their <br/>
Health IT Modules’ capabilities and attest “yes” or “no” to the certification criterion. <br/>
For an assessment of this proposal’s costs and benefits, please refer to the Regulatory <br/>
Impact Analysis in section XIV of this preamble. We welcome comments on this assessment and <br/>
this proposal in general. We also note that some health IT presented for certification is not <br/>
designed to store authentication credentials. Therefore, we specifically request comment on <br/>
whether we should include an explicit provision in this criterion to accommodate such health IT. <br/>
This could be similar to the approach we have taken with the 2015 Edition “end-user device <br/>
encryption” criterion (§ 170.315(d)(7)(ii)), where we permit the criterion to be met if the health <br/>
IT developer indicates their technology is designed to prevent electronic health information from <br/>
being locally stored on end-user devices. <br/>

We propose to adopt a “multi-factor authentication” (MFA) criterion in § 170.315(d)(13) <br/>
and include it in the P&amp;S certification framework (§ 170.550(h)).<b> </b>We propose to make the <br/>
“multi-factor authentication” certification criterion applicable to any Health IT Module currently <br/>
certified to the 2015 Edition and any Health IT Module presented for certification. Health IT <br/>
developers have already been implementing MFA to meet the Electronic Prescribing of <br/>
Controlled Substances (EPCS) requirements set by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), <br/>
and if adopted, this certification criterion would be general in that its intended outcome would <br/>
provide more public transparency around the MFA capabilities included in certified health IT.  <br/>
This proposal supports the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) led initiative <br/>
“STOP, THINK, CONNECT” which strongly recommends and runs campaigns to promote <br/>
stronger authentication, typically related to MFA, going beyond a username and password to log <br/>
in. MFA is also recommended by numerous organizations and groups. In the “Report on <br/>
Improving Cybersecurity in the Health Care Industry,”<a href="ONCs.html#105">30 </a>the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity <br/>
Task Force recommended requiring strong authentication to improve identity and access <br/>
management for health care workers, patients, and medical devices/EHRs. Using a single factor <br/>
approach to accessing information is particularly prone to cyber-attack because one factor <br/>
passwords can be weak, stolen, and are vulnerable to external phishing attacks, malware, and <br/>
social engineering threats. In situations where the provider is accessing a health IT product or <br/>
health information exchange external to the hospital or clinical environment, the Health Care <br/>
Industry Cybersecurity Task Force recommended that the health care industry adopt the NIST SP <br/>

800-46 guidelines for remote access, including the use of two-factor authentication to ensure a <br/>
compromised password cannot alone be used to gain access. Promoting the use of MFA and <br/>
leveraging biometrics, mobile phones, and/or wearables can help to establish a trust relationship <br/>
with the patient. Additionally, NIST recommends any personal data, whether self-asserted or <br/>
validated, require MFA.  <br/>
However, despite the benefits of adopting MFA, we are also aware of some of the <br/>
challenges. Specifically, in health care, many providers are resistant to adopt MFA because of <br/>
the inconvenience and loss of time of going through another step to access the patient’s EHI. <br/>
Also, MFA has not been deployed very long in the health care setting, so it is not clear how <br/>
much it actually addresses the risk. In most MFA implementations, passwords are still present. In <br/>
addition to having to manage passwords, users also have to manage an additional layer of <br/>
security. Another usability challenge is that systems often require different types of MFA, which <br/>
adds to the complexity and also may require providers to keep track of tokens. MFA is often <br/>
recommended as a solution to password problems, but it is still vulnerable to theft. These <br/>
alternative forms of authentication have their own set of vulnerability issues. The cost of <br/>
implementing MFA and ensuring it will be implemented in a way that does not inhibit clinical <br/>
workflow is also an issue to be considered.  <br/>
To provide clarity as to what a “yes” attestation for “multi-factor authentication” <br/>
attestation would mean, we provide the following explanation. MFA requires users to <br/>
authenticate using multiple means to confirm they are who they claim to be in order to prove <br/>
one’s identity, under the assumption that it is unlikely that an unauthorized individual or entity <br/>
will be able to succeed when more than one token is required. MFA includes using two or more <br/>

of these: (i) something people know, such as a password or a personal identification number <br/>
(PIN); (ii) something people have, such as a phone, badge, card, RSA token or access key; and <br/>
(iii) something people are, such as fingerprints, retina scan, heartbeat, and other biometric <br/>
information. Thus, in order to be issued a certification, we propose to require that a Health IT <br/>
Module developer attest to whether or not its certified health IT supports MFA consistent with <br/>
industry recognized standards (e.g., NIST Special Publication 800-63B Digital Authentication <br/>
Guidelines, ISO 27001).  <br/>
We propose that, for health IT certified prior to a subsequent final rule’s effective date, <br/>
the health IT would need to be certified to the “multi-factor authentication” certification criterion <br/>
within six months after the final rule’s effective date. For health IT certified for the first time <br/>
after the final rule’s effective date, we propose that the health IT must meet this criterion at the <br/>
time of certification. This should allow sufficient time for health IT developers to assess their <br/>
Health IT Modules’ capabilities and attest “yes” or “no” to the certification criterion. <br/>
We generally seek comment on whether there is value in adopting the proposed “multi-<br/>
factor authentication” criterion. We also solicit comment on the method of attestation and, if the <br/>
health IT developer does attest to supporting MFA, whether we should require the health IT <br/>
developer to explain how they support MFA. For example, should the health IT developer be <br/>
required to identify the MFA technique(s) used/supported by submitting specific information on <br/>
how it is implemented, including identifying the purpose(s)/use(s) to which MFA is applied <br/>
within their Health IT Module (such as where in the clinical workflow it is required), and, as <br/>
applicable, whether the MFA solution complies with industry standard? This information could <br/>
enable the health IT developer to highlight their health IT’s capabilities to support MFA. <br/>

7. Data Segmentation for Privacy and Consent Management Criteria <br/>
We adopted two 2015 Edition “data segmentation for privacy” (DS4P) certification <br/>
criteria in the 2015 Edition final rule. One criterion (“DS4P-send” (§ 170.315(b)(7)) includes <br/>
capabilities for creating a summary care record formatted to the C-CDA 2.1 standard and <br/>
document-level tagging as restricted (and subject to restrictions on re-disclosure) according to <br/>
the DS4P standard. The other criterion (“DS4P-receive” (§ 170.315(b)(8)) includes capabilities <br/>
for receiving a summary care record formatted to the C-CDA 2.1 standard and document-level <br/>
tagged as restricted (and subject to restrictions on re-disclosure) according to the DS4P standard. <br/>
As noted in the 2015 Edition final rule (80 FR 62646)), certification to these criteria is not <br/>
required to meet the CEHRT definition for CMS EHR Incentive Programs, now referred to as the <br/>
Promoting Interoperability Programs. The current 2015 Edition DS4P certification criteria <br/>
specify the technical capabilities that the health IT must have to apply and recognize security <br/>
labels in a summary document (C-CDA) such that the recipient of a summary document would <br/>
be able to recognize the existence of sensitive elements within the summary document (80 FR <br/>
62646). Security labeling provides a way for computer systems to properly handle data passed <br/>
among systems, to preserve the condition of security, and to enable access control decisions on <br/>
the information, so that the information is only accessed by the appropriate entities. The HL7 <br/>
Healthcare Classification System (HCS) standard provides a common syntax and semantics for <br/>
interoperable security labels in health care. The DS4P standard makes use of the HCS <br/>
specification and describes a method for applying security labels to HL7 CDA documents to <br/>
ensure that privacy policies established at a record’s source can be understood and enforced by <br/>
the recipient of the record. <br/>

 <br/>
In the 2015 Edition final rule, we noted that the DS4P standard is not restricted to data <br/>
subject to the federal regulations governing the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder <br/>
Patient Records (42 CFR part 2) (80 FR 62647). It may be implemented to support other data <br/>
exchange use cases in which compliance with state or federal legal frameworks require sensitive <br/>
health information to be tagged and segmented (80 FR 62647). We further stated that we offered <br/>
certification to these criteria as an initial step towards the ability of an interoperable health care <br/>
system to use technical standards to compute and persist security labels to permit access, use, or <br/>
disclosure of protected health information in accordance with applicable policies and patient <br/>
preferences. We understood and acknowledged additional challenges surrounding the prevalence <br/>
of unstructured data, sensitive images, and potential issues around use of sensitive health <br/>
information by clinical decision support systems. The adoption of document level data <br/>
segmentation for structured documents would not solve these issues, but we acknowledged it <br/>
would help move technology in the direction where these issues could be addressed (80 FR <br/>
16841).  <br/>
Adoption of the current 2015 Edition DS4P criteria was also consistent with earlier HIT <br/>
Policy Committee (HITPC) recommendations on the use of DS4P technology to enable the <br/>
electronic implementation and management of disclosure policies that originate from the patient, <br/>
the law, or an organization, in an interoperable manner, so that electronic sensitive health <br/>
information may be appropriately shared.<a href="ONCs.html#109">31</a> These HITPC recommendations consisted of a glide <br/>

(document level tagging) send and receive functionality. The HITPC also recommended <br/>
advancing the exchange of 42 CFR part 2-protected data, by outlining additional capabilities in <br/>

managing computable patient consent for the use of restricted data.<a href="ONCs.html#110">32 </a> <br/>
Since the 2015 Edition final rule, the health care industry has engaged in additional field <br/>
testing and implementation of the DS4P standard. As of the beginning of the third quarter of the <br/>
2018 CY, only about 20 products (products with multiple certified versions were counted once) <br/>
were certified to the current 2015 Edition DS4P certification criteria. In addition, stakeholders <br/>
shared with ONC – through public forums, listening sessions, and correspondence – that <br/>
focusing certification on segmentation to only the document level does not permit providers the <br/>
flexibility to address more granular segmentation needs. Stakeholders noted that certain provider <br/>
types, such as providers of pediatric care and behavioral health care, are currently using a range <br/>
of burdensome manual workflows in order to meet complex use cases for DS4P which are also <br/>
impacted by state and local laws. Additionally, stakeholders have expressed interest in ONC <br/>
exploring health IT standards that work with DS4P to support the management of consent for <br/>
sharing documents that include security labels such as through the use of an API.   <br/>
Therefore, in consideration of stakeholder feedback and our stated policy approach to <br/>
adopt DS4P certification criteria on a glide path, we propose to remove the current 2015 Edition <br/>

C-CDA and the HL7 DS4P standard. These criteria would include capabilities for applying the <br/>
DS4P standard at the document, section, and entry level. We believe this offers more valuable <br/>
functionality to providers and patients, especially given the complexities of the landscape of <br/>
privacy laws for multiple care and specialty settings. We believe health IT certified to these <br/>
criteria could support multiple practice settings and use cases. For example, in section VI.A.2 of <br/>
this preamble, we explain how the proposed capabilities included in these criteria could support <br/>
the pediatric health care setting. We believe this proposal could also reduce burden for providers <br/>
by leveraging health IT’s ability to recognize and manage sensitive data and patient consent <br/>
directives, rather than relying on case-by-case manual redaction and subsequent workarounds to <br/>
transmit redacted documents. We emphasize that health care providers already have processes <br/>
and workflows to address their existing compliance obligations which could be made more <br/>
efficient and cost effective through the use of health IT. We recognize that more granular privacy <br/>
markings at the point of data capture would further support existing and future priorities of states <br/>
for multiple care and specialty settings, including behavioral health and pediatric health care <br/>
settings.  <br/>
We welcome public comment on our proposals to replace the current 2015 Edition DS4P <br/>
criteria and adopt new 2015 Edition DS4P-send (§ 170.315(b)(12)) and DS4P-receive <br/>
(§ 170.315(b)(13)) criteria to support improved options for data segmentation for health care <br/>
providers engaged in complex use cases such as those identified in pediatric care (<i>see also</i> <br/>
section VI.A) and behavioral health care, including for opioid use disorder (OUD) (<i>see also</i> <br/>

In collaboration with ONC, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services <br/>
Administration (SAMHSA) developed the Consent2Share application to address the specific <br/>
privacy protections of patients with substance use disorders who are covered by the federal <br/>
confidentiality regulation, 42 CFR Part 2. Consent2Share is an open source application for data <br/>
segmentation and consent management. It is designed to integrate with existing FHIR systems. <br/>
SAMHSA created a FHIR implementation guide (the Consent2Share Consent Profile Design, <br/>
hereafter referred to as “Consent Implementation Guide”) that describes how the Consent2Share <br/>
(C2S) application and associated access control solution uses the FHIR Consent resource to <br/>
represent and persist patient consent for treatment, research, or disclosure.<a href="ONCs.html#113">37 </a>The implementation <br/>
guide provides instructions for using the FHIR Consent resource to capture a record of a health <br/>
care consumer’s privacy preferences.  <br/>
As discussed in section VII.B.4 of this proposed rule, we are proposing policies related to <br/>
the implementation of a standardized API to support the exchange of health information between <br/>
providers and patients and among members of a care team. We anticipate that the proposed 2015 <br/>
Edition “standardized API for patient and population services” certification criterion (§ <br/>
170.315(g)(10)) will result in a proliferation of APIs that will enable a more flexible and less <br/>
burdensome approach to exchanging EHI. We believe the health care industry can leverage this <br/>
API infrastructure to share segmented data in a secure and scalable manner. Therefore, we <br/>
propose to adopt a 2015 Edition certification criterion “consent management for APIs” in § <br/>
170.315(g)(11) to support data segmentation and consent management through an API in <br/>
                                                 <br/>

accordance with the Consent Implementation Guide. Certification to this criterion would be at a <br/>
health IT developer’s discretion and would indicate that a system is capable of responding to <br/>
requests through an API for patient consent directives that include standards-based security <br/>
labeling.<b> </b><br/>
We acknowledge that our proposed implementation specification, the Consent <br/>
Implementation Guide, is based on a different version of the FHIR standard (FHIR Standard for <br/>
Trial Use 3, also known as FHIR Release 3) than the proposed “standardized API for patient and <br/>
population services” criteria (§ 170.315(g)(10)) which is proposed to reference just FHIR <br/>
Release 2. Furthermore, we acknowledge that this discrepancy may result in additional <br/>
implementation efforts for developers. In ideal circumstances, we would have proposed a data <br/>
segmentation and consent management standard for APIs that was based on FHIR Release 2 and <br/>
aligned with the “standardized API for patient and population services” criteria proposed in this <br/>
proposed rule. However, although SAMHSA also created a consent implementation guide based <br/>
on FHIR Release 2,<a href="ONCs.html#114">38 </a>the guide used the FHIR “Contract” resource to represent patient consent <br/>
directives. It is our understanding that an approach based on the “Contract” resource has since <br/>
been abandoned by the industry in favor of using the “Consent” resource which was introduced <br/>
in FHIR Release 3. Moreover, the FHIR Release 2 version of the Consent Implementation Guide <br/>
went through relatively little testing and was never formally implemented because SAMHSA <br/>
began developing an update to the guide based on the “Consent” resource in FHIR Release 3. <br/>
Consequently, proposing an implementation specification based on FHIR Release 2 would not <br/>

have aligned with the more common implementation of FHIR-based consent directives by the <br/>
health care industry. We do not anticipate that the initial misalignment between the proposed <br/>
API criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)) and the proposed third DS4P criterion (§ 170.315(g)(11)) will <br/>
pose a significant burden on health IT developers. Further, our proposal to permit health IT <br/>
developers to voluntarily implement and use a new version of an adopted standard or <br/>
implementation specification so long as such version was approved by the National Coordinator <br/>
for use in certification through the Standards Version Advancement Process , discussed in <br/>
section VII.B.5, would enable standards version alignment between these two criteria in the <br/>
future as the FHIR standard matures.<b> </b><br/>
SAMHSA created the “Consent Implementation Guide” to support developers in <br/>
implementing the FHIR Consent resource to represent patient consent for treatment, research, <br/>
and disclosure. The Consent Implementation Guide provides instructions for using the FHIR <br/>
“Consent” resource to capture a record of a health care consumer’s privacy preferences. <br/>
Implementing an instance of the FHIR Consent resource based on this guide allows for a patient <br/>
consent to permit or deny identified recipient(s) or recipient role(s) to perform one or more <br/>
actions, regarding the patient’s health information for specific purposes and periods of time. For <br/>
example the Consent Implementation Guide supports consent management for specific use cases <br/>
to permit or deny disclosure based on a specific law, regulation, or policy under which the <br/>
patient consented. The implementation guide uses security labels as a mechanism for specifying <br/>
a patient’s preferences (e.g., permit disclosure of EHI labeled “restricted”). The Consent <br/>
Implementation Guide provides a much simpler mechanism for representing a patient’s consent <br/>

preferences than the old approach based on FHIR Release 2 and has undergone implementation <br/>
and pilot testing by SAMHSA’s Consent2Share (C2S) application.  <br/>
Our proposal to adopt the version aligned with FHIR Release 3 and the FHIR Release 3 <br/>
standard for this criterion reflects stakeholder interests and efforts to support particular use cases. <br/>
C2S enables data segmentation and consent management for disclosure of several discrete <br/>
categories of sensitive health data related to conditions and treatments including: alcohol, <br/>
tobacco and substance use disorders (including opioid use disorder), behavioral health, <br/>
HIV/AIDS, and sexuality and reproductive health. These capabilities support multiple use cases <br/>
in both primary and specialty care, and specifically address priority needs identified by <br/>
stakeholders to support pediatric care. We emphasize that health care providers already have <br/>
processes and workflows to address their existing compliance obligations which could be made <br/>
more efficient and cost effective through the use of health IT. Finally, given that the FHIR <br/>
standard is modular in nature, and especially since the “Consent” resource did not exist in FHIR <br/>
Release 2, we anticipate that health IT developers that elect to certify to this criterion would be <br/>
able to support the Consent Implementation Guide along with the API requirements specified in <br/>
“standardized API for patient and population services” (§ 170.315(g)(10)) with modest extra <br/>
effort.  <br/>
We welcome comments on this proposal. We specifically seek comment on how the <br/>
availability of this proposed certification criterion might increase the ability to support multiple <br/>
care coordination and privacy priorities, including those associated with pediatric care; and <br/>
whether we should consider other similar API based options and resources as standards for <br/>
certification criteria. We also seek comment on whether the misalignment between the versions <br/>

of the FHIR standard used by our proposed “consent management for APIs” and “standardized <br/>

and implementers. Specifically, we seek comment on if certification to the “consent management <br/>

population services” criteria at such a time as the criteria are aligned to one version of the FHIR <br/>
standard or if the option to certify to the “consent management for APIs” should be allowed for <br/>
those developers interested in doing so even without current standards alignment. We note that <br/>
SAMHSA is currently pursuing additional work to expand use cases related to data segmentation <br/>

In the FY 2019 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (83 FR 20516), CMS proposed scoring <br/>
and measurement policies to move beyond the three stages of meaningful use to a new phase of <br/>
EHR measurement with an increased focus on interoperability and improving patient access to <br/>
health information. To reflect this focus, CMS changed the name of the Medicare and Medicaid <br/>
EHR Incentive Programs, to the Medicare and Medicaid Promoting Interoperability (PI) <br/>
Programs. To align with the renaming of the EHR Incentive Programs, we propose to remove <br/>
references to the EHR Incentive Programs and replace them with “Promoting Interoperability <br/>
Programs” in the 2015 Edition “automated numerator recording” criterion in § 170.315(g)(1) and <br/>
the “automated measure calculation” criterion in § 170.315(g)(2). <br/>

Currently, § 170.315(d)(2), “auditable events and tamper resistance,” includes a cross-<br/>
reference to § 170.315(d)(7). However, the cross reference to § 170.315(d)(7), “end-user device <br/>
encryption,” does not always apply. We propose to revise § 170.550(h)(3) to apply the § <br/>
170.315(d)(7) cross reference as appropriate and exempt § 170.315(d)(7) when the certificate <br/>
scope does not require § 170.315(d)(7) certification (<i>see</i> § 170.315(d)(2)(i)(C)). Paragraph <br/>
170.315(d)(2)(i)(C) is not applicable for the privacy and security testing and certification of a <br/>
Health IT Module required by § 170.550(h)(3)(iii), (v), (vii), and (viii). This specific requirement <br/>
was intended to be exempted. It would only apply if § 170.315(d)(7) was also required for <br/>
privacy and security testing and certification, which it is not under the aforementioned <br/>
paragraphs. For example, a developer that is seeking to certify a Health IT Module to § <br/>
170.315(h) will not necessarily have end-user device encryption features (<i>see</i> § 170.315(d)(7)). <br/>
As such, certification can proceed for the audit log process without the Health IT Module <br/>
demonstrating that it can record an encryption status as required by § 170.315(d)(2)(i)(C). We <br/>
have previously identified this error in guidance and now propose to codify the correction in <br/>
regulation.<a href="ONCs.html#118">39 </a> <br/>

computerized provider order entry (CPOE)” § 170.315(a)(4); “clinical decision support” § <br/>

criteria would not<b> </b>have to demonstrate the capabilities required by the 2015 Edition <br/>

certification to another criterion that requires certification to the 2015 Edition “amendments” <br/>
criterion under the P&amp;S certification framework. This has already been incorporated into sub-<br/>

We propose to remove § 170.315(e)(1)(ii)(B) which includes a cross-reference to § <br/>

activity history log requirements if it is also certified to the 2015 Edition “auditable events and <br/>
tamper-resistance” certification criterion (§ 170.315(d)(2)). However, we no longer require <br/>
testing of activity history log when certifying for § 170.315(d)(2). Therefore, this cross-reference <br/>
is no longer applicable to meet certification requirements for the 2015 Edition “view, download, <br/>

Consistent with the 2015 Edition privacy and security certification framework, each <br/>
certification criterion has a set of appropriate P&amp;S “safeguards” that must be in place. In the <br/>
2015 Edition, we required that an ONC–ACB must ensure that a Health IT Module presented for <br/>
certification to any of the certification criteria that fall into each regulatory text “first level <br/>
paragraph” category of § 170.315 (<i>e.g.</i>, § 170.315(a)) identified below would be certified to <br/>
either Approach 1 (technically demonstrate) or Approach 2 (system documentation). In this <br/>

§ 170.315(a) through (h) Certification Criterion <br/>
§ 170.315(d)(13) <br/>
An ONC-ACB must ensure that a Health IT Module presented for certification to any of the certification <br/>criteria that fall into each regulatory text “first level paragraph” category of § 170.315 (e.g. § 170.315(a)) <br/>identified in the table above is certified to either Approach 1 (technically demonstrate) or Approach 2 <br/>(system documentation). In addition, we propose that health IT developers seeking certification to any § <br/>170.315 certification criterion for their Health IT Modules attest to whether they encrypt authentication <br/>credentials (§ 170.315(d)(12)) and support multi-factor authentication (§ 170.315(d)(13)). <br/> <br/>We clarify that of the adopted 2015 Edition certification criteria, only the privacy and security criteria <br/>specified in § 170.315(g)(1) through (6) are exempt from the 2015 Edition privacy and security <br/>certification framework due to the capabilities included in these criteria, which do not implicate privacy <br/>and security concerns. <br/> <br/>In order to be issued a certification, a Health IT Module would only need to be tested once to each <br/>applicable privacy and security criterion identified as part of Approach 1 or Approach 2 so long as the <br/>health IT developer attests that such privacy and security capabilities apply to the full scope of <br/>capabilities included in the requested certification, except for the certification of a Health IT Module to § <br/>170.315(e)(1) “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” and (e)(2) “secure messaging.”  For each of <br/>these criteria, a Health IT Module must be separately tested to § 170.315(d)(9) because of the specific <br/>capabilities for secure electronic transmission and secure electronic messaging included in each criterion, <br/>respectively. We also propose the health IT developers seeking certification to any § 170.315 <br/>certification criterion for their Health IT Modules attest to whether they encrypt authentication <br/>credentials (§ 170.315(d)(12)) and support multi-factor authentication (§ 170.315(d)(13)). <br/>* § 170.315(d)(2)(i)(C) is not required if the scope of the Health IT Module does not have end-user <br/>device encryption features. <br/>

 <br/><i>B. Principles of Proper Conduct for ONC-ACBs </i><br/>
<i> </i><br/>
1. Records Retention <br/>
We propose to revise the records retention requirement in § 170.523(g) to include the <br/>
“life of the edition” as well as 3 years after the retirement of an edition related to the certification <br/>
of Complete EHRs and Health IT Module(s). In the 2015 Edition final rule (80 FR 62602), we <br/>
adopted a records retention provision that required ONC–ACBs to retain all records related to the <br/>
certification of Complete EHRs and Health IT Module(s) for the ‘‘life of the edition’’ plus an <br/>
additional 3 years, and the records would be available to HHS upon request during this period of <br/>
time. In the 2015 Edition final rule, the ‘‘life of the edition’’ was defined as beginning with the <br/>
codification of an edition of certification criteria in regulation and ending when the edition is <br/>
removed from regulation. We now propose to clarify that HHS has the ability to access <br/>
certification records for the “life of the edition,” which begins with the codification of an edition <br/>
of certification criteria in the Code of Federal Regulations through a minimum of 3 years from <br/>
the effective date that removes the applicable edition from the Code of Federal Regulations, not <br/>
solely during the 3-year period after removal from the CFR.  <br/>
2. Conformance Methods for Certification Criteria  <br/>
The Principle of Proper Conduct (PoPC) in § 170.523(h) specifies that ONC-ACBs may <br/>
only certify health IT that has been tested by ONC-ATLs  using tools and test procedures <br/>
approved by the National Coordinator. We propose to revise this PoPC in three ways. First, we <br/>
propose to revise this PoPC to additionally permit ONC-ACBs to certify Health IT Modules that <br/>
they have evaluated for conformance with certification criteria without first passing through an <br/>
ONC-ATL. However, we propose that such methods to determine conformity must first be <br/>

 <br/>
approved by the National Coordinator. This proposal provides valuable Program flexibility and <br/>
market efficiencies for streamlining Health IT Module certification, acknowledging the broad <br/>
spectrum of evidence of conformance, from laboratory testing with an ONC-ATL to developer <br/>
self-declaration. This Program flexibility will also allow us to leverage the success we have seen <br/>
in implementation of our alternative test method process where any entity can submit a test <br/>
procedure and/or test tool for approval for use under the Program. For example, the National <br/>
Coordinator may, under this provision, approve a conformance method for certification criteria <br/>
where evidence of a valid declaration of conformity (e.g., certification) granted under an external <br/>
program can be submitted directly to an ONC-ACB to meet the requirement of that certification <br/>
criteria.  <br/>
Second, we propose to revise the PoPC to clarify that certifications can only be issued to <br/>
Health IT Modules and not Complete EHRs. We are proposing to remove the 2014 Edition from <br/>
the CFR (<i>see</i> section II.B.2 of this preamble) and Complete EHR certifications are no longer <br/>
available for certification to the 2015 Edition (80 FR 62608; 79 FR 54443). We propose to <br/>
remove the provision that permits the use of test results from National Voluntary Laboratory <br/>
Accreditation Program (NVLAP)-accredited testing laboratories under the Program because the <br/>
regulatory transition period from NVLAP-accredited testing laboratories to ONC-ATLs has <br/>
expired (81 FR 72447).  <br/>
Third, we propose to remove the provision that permits the certification of health IT <br/>
previously certified to an edition if the certification criterion or criteria to which the Health IT <br/>
Module(s) was previously certified have not been revised and no new certification criteria are <br/>
applicable because the circumstances that this provision seeks to address are no longer feasible <br/>

 <br/>
with certification to the 2015 Edition. Any Health IT Module previously certified to the 2014 <br/>
Edition and presented for certification to the 2015 Edition would have at least one new or revised <br/>
2015 Edition certification criteria that would be applicable. For example, the 2015 Edition <br/>
“accessibility-centered design” criterion (§ 170.315(g)(5)) is applicable to any Health IT Module <br/>
presented for certification to the 2015 Edition. <br/>
3. ONC-ACBs to Accept Test Results from Any ONC-ATL in Good Standing <br/>
We propose to revise the PoPC for ONC-ACBs in order to address business relationships <br/>
between ONC-ACBs and ONC-ATLs. To encourage market competition, we propose to require <br/>
ONC-ACBs to accept test results from any ONC-ATL that is in good standing under the <br/>
Program and is compliant with its ISO 17025 accreditation requirements. However, if an ONC-<br/>
ACB has concerns about accepting test results from a certain ONC-ATL, the ONC-ACB would <br/>
have an opportunity to explain the potential issues to ONC and NVLAP, and on a case-by-case <br/>
basis, ONC could consider the facts and make the final determination.  <br/>
ONC-ATLs must be accredited by the NVLAP and seek authorization from ONC to <br/>
participate in the ONC Health IT Certification Program. ONC-ATLs test products against the <br/>
ONC-approved test method for the standards and certification criteria identified by the Secretary <br/>
using ONC-approved test methods. ONC-ACBs make certification determinations and conduct <br/>
surveillance for health IT originally tested by an ONC-ATL. Based on the process that all ONC-<br/>
ATLs must undergo, we believe that they are capable of providing accurate test results that <br/>
should be accepted by any ONC-ACB.  <br/>
The intent of this proposal is to ensure that ONC-ATLs are not discriminated against and <br/>
do not suffer injury from ONC-ACBs not accepting their test results if, in fact, they are in good <br/>

 <br/>
standing. This proposal may also prevent harm to health IT developers, who present their health <br/>
IT to be tested by ONC-ATLs and ultimately seek certification by ONC-ACBs under the <br/>
Program. These situations may arise if a health IT developer’s ONC-ACB leaves the Program or <br/>
goes out of business. This proposal may also prevent situations of preferential business <br/>
arrangements such as when one organization is both an ONC-ATL and ONC-ACB and will not <br/>
enter into a contract with another organization who is also an ONC-ATL. <br/>
4. Mandatory Disclosures and Certifications <br/>
We propose to revise the PoPC in § 170.523(k). We propose to remove § 170.523(k) <br/>
(1)(ii)(B) because certifications can only be issued to Health IT Modules and not Complete <br/>
EHRs. We are proposing to remove the 2014 Edition from the CFR (<i>see</i> section III.B.2 of this <br/>
preamble) and Complete EHR certifications are no longer available for certification to the 2015 <br/>
Edition (80 FR 62608; 79 FR 54443). We also propose to revise § 170.523(k)(1)(iii) to broaden <br/>
the section beyond just the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs (now referred to as <br/>
Promoting Interoperability Programs). We propose to revise the section to include a detailed <br/>
description of all known material information concerning additional types of costs or fees that a <br/>
user may be required to pay to implement or use the Health IT Module's capabilities, whether to <br/>
meet provisions of HHS programs requiring the use of certified health IT or to achieve any other <br/>
use within the scope of the health IT’s certification.  <br/>
We also propose to remove the provision in § 170.523(k)(3) that requires a certification <br/>
issued to a pre-coordinated, integrated bundle of Health IT Modules to be treated the same as a <br/>
certification issued to a Complete EHR for the purposes of § 170.523(k)(1), except that the <br/>
certification must also indicate each Health IT Module that is included in the bundle. We propose <br/>

 <br/>
to remove this provision because pre-coordinated, integrated bundles are no longer applicable for <br/>
certification under Program.  <br/>
We propose to revise § 170.523(k)(4) to clarify that a certification issued to a Health IT <br/>
Module based solely on the applicable certification criteria adopted by the ONC Health IT <br/>
Certification Program must be separate and distinct from any other certification(s) based on other <br/>
criteria or requirements. The intent of this provision, as indicated in the Establishment of the <br/>
Permanent Certification Program for Health Information Technology final rule (76 FR 1272), is <br/>
to ensure that any other certifications an ONC-ACB may issue, is separately indicated from the <br/>
applicable certification criteria adopted by the ONC Health IT Certification Program. <br/>
We also propose changes related to transparency attestations and limitations in section <br/>
III.B.5. of this preamble. Additionally, we propose other new PoPCs for ONC-ACBs in sections <br/>
VII.B.5 and VII.D of this preamble. <br/>
<i>C. Principles of Proper Conduct for ONC-ATLs – Records Retention </i><br/>
<i> </i><br/>
We propose to revise the records retention requirement in § 170.524(f) to include the “life <br/>
of the edition” as well as 3 years after the retirement of an edition related to the certification of <br/>
Health IT Module(s). The circumstances are the same as in section V.B.1 of this preamble <br/>
mentioned above, therefore, we propose the same revisions for ONC-ATLs as we did for ONC-<br/>
ACBs.  <br/>
<b>VI. Health IT for the Care Continuum </b><br/>
 <br/>
ONC believes health IT should help promote and support patient care when and where it <br/>
is needed. This means health IT should help support patient populations, specialized care, <br/>
transitions of care, and practice settings across the care continuum. In the Permanent <br/>

 <br/>
Certification Program final rule, we clarified that section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA provides the <br/>
National Coordinator with the authority to establish a voluntary certification program or <br/>
programs for other types of health IT beyond those which supported the EHR Incentive <br/>
Programs (now called the Promoting Interoperability Programs). However, we decided that the <br/>
initial focus of the Program should be on supporting the EHR Incentive Programs, which focuses <br/>
on EHR technology for the ambulatory and inpatient settings (76 FR 1294). As the Program <br/>
evolved and the adoption and use of certified health IT increased significantly, we modified the <br/>
Program in the 2015 Edition final rule to make it more open and accessible to more types of <br/>
health IT, including health IT that supports various care and practice settings beyond those <br/>
included in the EHR Incentive Programs (80 FR 62604). Our goal was then and is now to <br/>
support the advancement of interoperable health IT and to promote health IT functionality in care <br/>
and practice settings across the care continuum (<i>see also</i> 80 FR 62604).  <br/>
 <br/>
ONC’s efforts in the 2015 Edition to make the Program more open and accessible to <br/>
other care settings also aligned with fall 2013 recommendations from the HIT Policy Committee <br/>
(HITPC). The HITPC examined the extension of the Program to include functionalities that <br/>
would benefit settings not covered by the EHR Incentive Programs. The HITPC recommended <br/>
that considerations regarding functionality should focus on whether the functionality would:  <br/>
•  Advance a national priority or legislative mandate <br/>
•  Align with existing federal/state programs <br/>
•  Utilize the existing technology pipeline <br/>
•  Build on existing stakeholder support <br/>
•  Appropriately balance the costs and benefits of a certification program.  <br/>

 <br/>
Taking into consideration the HITPC recommendations, ONC’s 2015 Edition focused on <br/>
the adoption of certification criteria that are standards-based, applicable to a wide variety of care <br/>
and practice settings, and that advance the structured recording, access, exchange, and use of <br/>
health information. ONC has also encouraged users – including specialty groups – to continue to <br/>
work with developers to innovate, develop, and deploy health IT in specific clinical settings in <br/>
ways that promote safety, effectiveness, and efficient health care delivery while also reducing <br/>
burden.  <br/>
In the 2015 Edition final rule we stated that we did not intend to<i> </i>develop and issue <br/>
separate regulatory certification “paths” or “tracks” for particular care or practice settings (<i>e.g.</i>, a <br/>
“long-term and post-acute care (LTPAC) certification”) because it would be difficult to <br/>
<i>independently</i> construct such “paths” or “tracks” in a manner that would align with other relevant <br/>
programs and specific stakeholder needs. While we never have had intentions to adopt care- or <br/>
practice-specific certification tracks, or additional voluntary program(s), in parallel to the <br/>
existing voluntary ONC Health IT Certification Program, we stated that we would welcome the <br/>
opportunity to work with HHS agencies, other agencies, and provider associations in identifying <br/>
the appropriate functionality and certification criteria in the Program to support their <br/>
stakeholders (80 FR 62704). This approach is consistent with the recommendations by the <br/>
HITPC.  <br/>
Since the publication of the 2015 Edition final rule, ONC has explored how we might <br/>
work with the industry and with specialty organizations to collaboratively advance health IT that <br/>
supports medical specialties and sites of service. As a result, we have gained insight from <br/>
stakeholders regarding the burdens associated with establishing a specific set of required <br/>

unintended consequence of stifling progress for that setting. Stakeholders noted that the timeline <br/>

criteria in practice settings is not always aligned with standards updates, the emergence of new <br/>
standards, or technological innovation. Finally, stakeholders have urged ONC to leverage <br/>
multiple means to advance interoperability standards that are widely applicable, to enable and <br/>
promote innovation that is supported by these standards, and – in collaboration with stakeholders <br/>
– to monitor and support developments in emerging standards and technologies for specialty use <br/>
cases.   <br/>
Section 4001(b)(i) of the Cures Act instructs the National Coordinator to encourage, keep, or <br/>
recognize, through existing authorities, the voluntary certification of health IT under the Program <br/>
for use in medical specialties and sites of service for which no such technology is available or <br/>
where more technological advancement or integration is needed. This provision of the Cures Act <br/>
closely aligns with ONC’s ongoing collaborative efforts with both federal partners and <br/>
stakeholders within the health care and health IT community to encourage and support the <br/>
advancement of health IT for a wide range of clinical settings. These initiatives have included <br/>
projects related to clinical priorities beyond those specifically included in the EHR Incentive <br/>
Programs (now called the Promoting Interoperability Programs) including efforts in public <br/>
health, behavioral health, and long-term and post-acute care. We further note that these <br/>
initiatives often include the development of non-regulatory informational resources to support <br/>

the specific implementation goal and align with the technical specifications already available in <br/>
the Program for certification. To advance these efforts, we generally consider a range of factors <br/>
including: stakeholder input and identification of clinical needs and clinical priorities, the <br/>
evolution and adoption of health IT across the care continuum, the costs and benefits associated <br/>
with any policy or implementation strategy related to care settings and sites of service, and <br/>
potential regulatory burden and compliance timelines. Generally, ONC’s approach can be <br/>
summarized in three parts:  <br/>
•  First, ONC analyzes existing certification criteria to identify how such criteria may be <br/>
applicable for medical specialties and sites of service.  <br/>
•  Second, ONC focuses on the real-time evaluation of existing and emerging standards to <br/>
determine applicability to medical specialties and sites of service as well as to the broader <br/>
care continuum, including the evaluation of such standards for inclusion in the ONC <br/>
Interoperability Standards Advisory (ISA).<a href="ONCs.html#130">41</a>  <br/>
•  Third, ONC may work in collaboration with stakeholders to support the development of <br/>
informational resources for medical specialties and sites of service for which ONC identifies <br/>
a need to advance the effective implementation of certified health IT.  <br/>
We believe this approach provides an economical, flexible, and responsive option for <br/>
both health care providers and the health IT industry, which is also in alignment with the <br/>
provisions of the Cures Act related to burden reduction and promoting interoperability. We are <br/>
committed to continuing to work with stakeholders in this manner to encourage and advance the <br/>
adoption of health IT to support medical specialties and sites of service, and to help ensure that <br/>

patient health information is available across a care settings.   <br/>
This section outlines our approach to implement Section 4001(b) of the Cures Act, which <br/>
requires that the Secretary make recommendations for the voluntary certification of health IT for <br/>
use by pediatric health providers and to adopt certification criteria to support the voluntary <br/>
certification of health IT for use by pediatric health providers to support the health care of <br/>
children. To be clear, and consistent with past practice, we do not recommend or propose a <br/>
“pediatric-specific track or program” under the ONC Health IT Certification Program.  This <br/>
proposed rule outlines the certification criteria adopted in the 2015 Edition which we believe <br/>
support the certification of health IT for pediatric care. Finally, it identifies the new and revised <br/>
criteria proposed in this rule which we believe further support the voluntary certification of <br/>
health IT for pediatric care. We have included in the appendix of this proposed rule a set of <br/>
technical worksheets that can help inform your comments on the recommendations, the new and <br/>
revised criteria in the Program that would also support pediatric care settings, and the overall <br/>
approach we have herein described. These worksheets outline the following information: <br/>
•  The alignment of each recommendation to the Children’s Model EHR Format<a href="ONCs.html#131">42</a> as identified <br/>
by stakeholders (see also Section VI.A.1 and 2 for further detail on the Children’s Model <br/>
EHR Format and the recommendations).  <br/>
•  The alignment of each recommendation to the 2015 Edition certification criteria and new or <br/>
revised criteria described in this proposed rule (see also section VI.A.2.a and b).   <br/>

We invite readers to use these worksheets to inform public comment on <br/>
the recommendations and criteria described in Section VI.A.2 specifically as they <br/>relate to pediatric health care use cases.

Furthermore, these comments, and the detailed insights received <br/>through stakeholder outreach, may inform the future development of a non-<br/>binding informational guide or resource to provide useful information for health <br/>IT developers and pediatric care providers seeking to successfully implement <br/>these health IT solutions in a clinical setting.  <br/>
  <br/>
<i>A. Health IT for Pediatric Setting  </i><br/>
Section 4001(b)(iii) of the Cures Act – “Health information technology for pediatrics” <br/>
requires that:  <br/>
•  First, that the Secretary, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, shall make <br/>
recommendations for the voluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric health <br/>
providers to support the health care of children, and  <br/>
•  Second, that the Secretary shall adopt certification criteria to support the voluntary <br/>
certification of health IT for use by pediatric health providers to support the health care of <br/>
children. <br/>
In this proposed rule, we describe our approach to stakeholder engagement, the analysis <br/>
used to develop the recommendations, and the specific certification criteria we believe can <br/>
support each recommendation.   <br/>

effective health IT tools and resources for pediatric care. These have included a number of <br/>
public-private partnerships including efforts between HHS, state agencies, and health systems for <br/>
innovative projects that range from care coordination enterprise solutions to immunization <br/>
information systems and to point of care solutions for specialty needs. In order to learn from and <br/>
build upon these efforts, ONC has engaged with stakeholders in both the public and private <br/>
sector including other federal, state and local government partners, health care providers engaged <br/>
in the care of children, standards development organizations, charitable foundations engaged in <br/>
children’s health care research, and health IT developers supporting pediatric care settings.     <br/>
For example, significant work has been done by the Agency for Healthcare Research and <br/>
Quality (AHRQ), CMS, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and <br/>
organizations around the Children’s Model EHR Format (Children’s Format), which is critical to <br/>
any discussion of the pediatric health IT landscape.<a href="ONCs.html#133">43 </a>The Children’s Format was authorized by <br/>
the 2009 Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA)<a href="ONCs.html#133">44 </a>and developed <br/>
by AHRQ in close collaboration with CMS. It was developed to bridge the gap between the <br/>
functionality present in most EHRs currently available and the functionality that could optimally <br/>
support the care of children. Specifically, the Children’s Format provides information to EHR <br/>
system developers and others about critical functionality and other requirements that are helpful <br/>
to include in an EHR system to address health care needs specific to the care of children. The <br/>
final version of the Children’s Format,<a href="ONCs.html#133">45 </a>released in 2015, consists of 47 high priority functional <br/>

requirements in 19 topic areas that focus on improvements that would better support the safety <br/>
and quality of care delivered to children. The Children’s Format was intended as a starting point <br/>
for developers, users, and purchasers for informing an approach for pediatric voluntary <br/>
certification. We refer to the Voluntary Edition proposed rule for a description of ONC’s prior <br/>
discussion around the Children’s Format (79 FR 10930). <br/>
In the summer of 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) reviewed the 2015 <br/>
Format using a robust analytical process and engagement with their members. The result was a <br/>
prioritized list of eight clinical priorities to support pediatric health care (“Priority List”). In <br/>
October 2017, ONC held a technical discussion with stakeholders titled “Health IT for <br/>
Pediatrics” with the specific purpose of obtaining input from an array of stakeholders in an effort <br/>
to draw correlations between the pediatric providers’ clinical priorities identified in the Priority <br/>
List with the detailed technical requirements outlined in the Children’s Format and the <br/>
capabilities and standards that could be included in certified health IT. Through this collaborative <br/>
approach, the meeting participants identified a set of priority needs for health IT to support <br/>
pediatric care based upon those identified by the Priority List and the primary correlation to the <br/>
Children’s Format.  <br/>
2.  Recommendations for the Voluntary Certification of Health IT for use in Pediatric <br/>
Care <br/>
To support the first part of Section 4001(b) of the Cures Act, ONC considered the <br/>
historical efforts on the Children’s Model EHR Format, the input from stakeholders, and our own <br/>
technical analysis and review of health IT capabilities and standards to develop a set of <br/>

recommendations for voluntary certification for health IT for pediatric care. These include eight <br/>
recommendations related to the Priority List: <br/>
•  Recommendation 1: Use biometric-specific norms for growth curves and support growth <br/>
charts for children <br/>
•  Recommendation 2: Compute weight-based drug dosage <br/>
•  Recommendation 3: Ability to document all guardians and caregivers <br/>
•  Recommendation 4: Segmented access to information <br/>
•  Recommendation 5: Synchronize immunization histories with registries <br/>
•  Recommendation 6: Age- and weight- specific single-dose range checking <br/>
•  Recommendation 7: Transferrable access authority <br/>
•  Recommendation 8: Associate maternal health information and demographics with newborn <br/>
We also developed two additional recommendations beyond the Priority List which relate <br/>
to other items within the Children’s Format that are considered important to pediatric <br/>
stakeholders. These additional recommendations, which we believe may be supported by <br/>
certified health IT, are as follows:  <br/>
•  Recommendation 9: Track incomplete preventative care opportunities <br/>
•  Recommendation 10: Flag special health care needs <br/>
In order to implement the second part of Section 4001(b) of the Cures Act for the <br/>
adoption of certification criteria to support the voluntary certification of health IT for use by <br/>
pediatric health care providers, we have identified both the 2015 Edition certification criteria and <br/>

a.  2015 Edition Certification Criteria <br/>
In order to implement the second part of Section 4001(b) of the Cures Act to adopt <br/>
certification criteria to support the voluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric health <br/>
providers to support the health care of children, we identified the following 2015 Edition <br/>
certification criteria that support the recommendations. Within the technical worksheets in the <br/>
appendix of this proposed rule, these criteria are noted under each recommendation to which <br/>
they are correlated. The 2015 Edition criteria are as follows: <br/>
•   “API functionality” criteria (§ 170.315(g)(7)-(g)(9)) which addresses many of the <br/>
challenges currently faced by patients and by caregivers such as parents or guardians <br/>
accessing child’s health information, including the “multiple portal” problem, by <br/>
potentially allowing individuals to aggregate health information from multiple sources in <br/>
a web or mobile application of their choice.  <br/>
•  “Care plan” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(9)) which supports pediatric care by facilitating the <br/>
documentation of electronic health information in a structured format to improve care <br/>
coordination (80 FR 62648-62649). <br/>
•  “Clinical decision support” (CDS) criterion (§ 170.315(a)(9)) which supports pediatric <br/>
care by enabling interventions based on the capture of biometric data.  <br/>

 <br/>
•  “Common Clinical Data Set” (adopted in (§170.315(b)(4) and §170.315(b)(5)) which <br/>
includes <i>optional </i>pediatric vital sign data elements including as optional the reference <br/>
range/growth curve for three pediatric vital signs--BMI percent per LOINC identifiers for <br/>
age per sex, weight per length/sex, and head occipital-frontal circumference for children <br/>
less than three years of age.  <br/>
•  “Data segmentation for privacy” send criterion and receive criterion (adopted in <br/>
§170.315(b)(7) and §170.315(b)(8))  which provides the ability to: create a summary <br/>
record that is tagged at the document level as restricted and subject to re-disclosure; <br/>
receive a summary record that is document-level tagged as restricted; separate the <br/>
document-level tagged document from other documents received; and, view the restricted <br/>
document without having to incorporate any of the data from the document.   <br/>
•  “Demographics” criterion (§ 170.315(a)(5)) which supports pediatric care through the <br/>
capture of values and value sets relevant for the pediatric health care setting as well as <br/>
allowing for improved patient matching which is a key challenge for pediatric care.  <br/>
•  <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/2015Ed_CCG_b3-E-prescribing.pdf">“Electronic </a>Prescribing” criterion (adopted in §170.315(b)(3)) which includes an <i>optional</i> <br/>
Structured and Codified Sig Format, which has the capability to exchange weight-based <br/>
dosing calculations within the NCPDP SCRIPT 10.6 standard and limits the ability to <br/>
prescribe all oral, liquid medications in only metric standard units of mL (i.e., not cc) <br/>
important for enabling safe prescribing practices for children.  <br/>
•  “Family health history” criterion (§ 170.315(a)(12)) which supports pediatric care <br/>
because it leverages concepts or expressions for familial conditions, which are especially <br/>
clinically relevant when caring for children.  <br/>

•  “Patient health information capture” criterion (§ 170.315(e)(3)) which supports <br/>
providers’ ability to accept health information from a patient or authorized representative. <br/>
This criterion could support pediatric care through documentation of decision-making <br/>
authority of a patient representative.  <br/>
•   “Social, psychological, and behavioral data’’ criterion § 170.315(a)(15) which supports <br/>
integration of behavioral health data into a child’s record across the care continuum by <br/>
enabling a user to record, change, and access a patient’s social, psychological, and <br/>
behavioral data based using SNOMED CT® and LOINC® codes.  <br/>
•  “Transitions of care” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)) which supports structured transition of <br/>
care summaries and referral summaries that help ensure the coordination and continuity <br/>
of health care as children transfer between different clinicians at different health care <br/>
organizations or different levels of care within the same health care organization; <br/>
•  “Transmission to immunization registries” criterion (§ 170.315(f)(1)) which supports the <br/>
safe and effective provision of child health care through immunizations and registry <br/>
linkages. This criterion also provides the ability to request, access, and display the <br/>

We note that some of these criteria may be updated based on proposals contained in this <br/>
proposed rule; however, we believe that prior to any such updates, technology that is currently <br/>
available and certified to these 2015 Edition criteria can make a significant impact in supporting <br/>
providers engaged in the health care of children. We invite readers to use the technical <br/>

b.  New or Revised Certification Criteria in this Proposed Rule <br/>
In order to implement the second part of Section 4001(b)(iii) of the Cures Act to adopt <br/>
certification criteria to support the voluntary certification of health information technology for <br/>
use by pediatric health providers to support the health care of children, we identified new or <br/>
revised certification criteria in this proposed rule that support the recommendations. These new <br/>
or revised criteria and standards in this proposed rule that would support pediatric settings <br/>
include:  <br/>
                                                 <br/>
47 The VDT criterion includes a “patient-authorized representative” concept that aligns with the use of the term <br/>under the EHR Incentive Program. A “patient-authorized representative” is defined as any individual to whom the <br/>patient has granted access to their health information (see also<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/77-FR-13720"> 77 FR 13720)</a>. However, consent is not needed for <br/>minors, for whom existing local, state, or federal law grants their parents or guardians access (see also<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/77-FR-13720"> 77 FR <br/>13720).</a> <br/>

•  New API criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)) which would serve to implement the Cures Act <br/>
requirement to permit health information to be accessed, exchanged, and used from APIs <br/>
without special effort (see section IV.B.5 of this proposed rule) <br/>
•  New “DS4P” criteria (two for C-CDA ((§ 170.315(b)(12)) and (§ 170.315(b)(13)) and one <br/>
for FHIR (§ 170.315(g)(11))) that would support a more granular approach to privacy <br/>
tagging data for health information exchange supported by either the C-CDA- or FHIR-based <br/>
exchange standards (see section VI.A for a discussion of this criteria in relation to pediatric <br/>
settings and section VI.B for discussion of these criteria in relation to Opioid Use Disorder) <br/>
•  New electronic prescribing certification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(11)), which would supports <br/>
improved patient safety and prescription accuracy, workflow efficiencies, and increased <br/>
configurability of systems including functionality that could support pediatric medication <br/>
management. <br/>
•  USCDI (§ 170.213) which enables the inclusion of pediatric vital sign data elements, <br/>
including the reference range/scale or growth curve for BMI percentile per age and sex, <br/>
weight for age per length and sex, and head occipital-frontal circumference (and the criteria <br/>
that include the USCDI) <br/>
Each of these proposed criteria are further described in other sections of this proposed rule; <br/>
however, in this section of this proposed rule we specifically seek comment on the application of <br/>
these criteria to pediatric use cases in support of our recommendations for the voluntary <br/>
certification of health IT for pediatric care.  <br/>
For example, our proposal for three new 2015 Edition DS4P certification criteria (two for <br/>
C-CDA ((§ 170.315(b)(12)) and (§ 170.315(b)(13)) and one for FHIR (§ 170.315(g)(11))) could <br/>

provide functionality to address the concerns of multiple stakeholders in a range of specialty use <br/>
cases—including pediatric care settings. In this section of this proposed rule, we seek comment <br/>
specifically related to the inclusion of these criteria in our recommendations. Specifically, <br/>
stakeholders have expressed the need to—based on the intended recipient of the data—to restrict <br/>
granular pediatric health data at production. We believe these criteria could, for example, help <br/>
enable providers to: <br/>
•  Limit the sharing of reproductive and sexual health data from an EHR in order to protect the <br/>
minor’s privacy;  <br/>
•  Prevent disclosure of an emancipated minor’s sensitive health information, while also <br/>
permitting a parent or legal guardian to provide consent for treatment; and  <br/>
•  Segment child abuse information based on jurisdictional laws, which may have varying <br/>
information sharing requirements for parents, guardians, and/or other possible legal <br/>
representatives.  <br/>
While health care providers should already have processes and workflows in place to <br/>
address their existing compliance obligations, we recognize that more granular privacy markings <br/>
at the point of data capture would further support existing and future priorities of pediatric health <br/>
providers, as well as for multiple medical specialties and sites of service. We also recognize that <br/>
such point of data capture markings can reduce administrative burden through efficiencies gained <br/>
in streamlined compliance workflows. <br/>

However, as discussed, through our experience and engagement with health care <br/>
providers and health IT developers, we believe that in some cases information resources can aid <br/>
in implementation in clinical settings. In the past, ONC has worked collaboratively with federal <br/>
partners, health IT developers, and the health care community to support the development of <br/>
non-regulatory informational resources that can provide additional support for health IT <br/>
implementation (see, for example, the ONC Patient Engagement Playbook). Such a resource <br/>
could include the recommendations and certification criteria here identified and synthesize these <br/>
technical recommendations with information outside of the Program related to patient safety, <br/>
usability, privacy and security, and other key considerations for successful implementation of a <br/>
health IT system within a clinical setting. We believe that the creation of such a resource, in <br/>
collaboration with clinical and technical stakeholders, would help  support the advancement of <br/>
health IT solutions for use in pediatric care and pediatric settings. We further include additional <br/>
information on prior ONC initiatives related to health IT for pediatric settings as available on our <br/>

<i>B. Health IT and Opioid Use Disorder Prevention and Treatment – Request for Information </i><br/>
<i> </i><br/>
We have identified a need to explore ways to advance health IT across the care <br/>
continuum to support efforts to fight the opioid epidemic. To that purpose, we seek comment in <br/>
this proposed rule on a series of questions related to health IT functionalities and standards to <br/>
support the effective prevention and treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) across patient <br/>
populations and care settings.   <br/>

 <br/>
We recognize the significance of the opioid epidemic confronting our nation and the <br/>
importance of helping to support health care providers committed to preventing inappropriate <br/>
access to prescription opioids and providing safe, appropriate treatment.  <br/>
HHS has a comprehensive strategy to combat the opioid crisis. It consists of five points <br/>
that are focused on better: addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery services; data; pain <br/>
management; targeting of overdose reversing drugs; and research.<a href="ONCs.html#144">48 </a>In support of this strategy, <br/>
HHS will improve access to prevention, treatment, and recovery support services; target the <br/>
availability and distribution of overdose-reversing drugs; strengthen public health data reporting <br/>
and collection; support cutting-edge research; and advance the practice of pain management. To <br/>
combat the opioid crisis, in October 2018, Congress passed the Substance Use-Disorder <br/>
Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and <br/>
Communities Act.  It aims to expand treatment, recovery, and prevention initiatives for substance <br/>
use disorder and also includes interoperability and health IT tools as a key part of the response to <br/>
this crisis.  <br/>
We believe health IT offers promising strategies to help medical specialties and sites of <br/>
service as they combat opioid use disorder (OUD). For example, health IT has the potential to <br/>
improve adherence to opioid prescribing guidelines and physician adherence to treatment <br/>
protocols, to increase the safety of prescribing for controlled substances, to enhance clinician <br/>
access to PDMPs, and to expand access to addiction treatment and recovery support services. <br/>
Additionally, through the Program, our goal continues to be to improve access to data from <br/>
disparate sources and help ensure that key data is consistently available to the right person, at the <br/>
                                                 <br/>

right place, and at the right time across the care continuum. One component of advancing that <br/>
goal is through technical standards for exchanging health information that form an essential <br/>
foundation for interoperability.   <br/>
ONC has heard from stakeholders including policymakers, implementers, health care <br/>
providers and patient advocacy groups that additional information is needed to assist in planning <br/>
for the effective use of health IT in OUD prevention and treatment. We additionally recognize <br/>
stakeholders’ interest in the new opioid measures (Query of PDMP measure and Verify Opioid <br/>
Treatment Agreement measure) included in CMS’s Promoting Interoperability Programs <br/>
(formerly known as the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs). These two measures <br/>
support HHS initiatives related to the treatment of opioid and substance use disorders by helping <br/>
health care providers avoid inappropriate prescriptions, improve coordination of prescribing <br/>
amongst health care providers, and focus on the advanced use of certified health IT in care <br/>
coordination for OUD prevention and treatment (83 FR 41644).   <br/>
In order to support these efforts, in this proposed rule we outline a brief overview of <br/>
some key areas of health IT implementation that could support OUD prevention and treatment. <br/>
These include consideration of current health IT certification criteria included in the 2015 <br/>
Edition, revised or new certification criteria as outlined in this proposed rule, and current health <br/>
IT initiatives underway in the health care industry or health IT industry which intersect with <br/>
ONC policy goals. In this section of the proposed rule, we request public comment specifically <br/>
from the perspective of how our existing Program requirements and proposals in this rulemaking <br/>
may support use cases related to OUD prevention and treatment and if there are additional areas <br/>
that ONC should consider for effective implementation of health IT-enabled OUD prevention <br/>

 <br/>
1. 2015 Edition Certification Criteria <br/>
We seek public comment on how the existing 2015 Edition certification criteria as well as <br/>
proposals within this proposed rule for revised or new criteria support OUD prevention and <br/>
treatment. Specifically, we seek comment on certification criteria previously adopted in the 2015 <br/>
Edition that can support clinical priorities, advance interoperability for OUD (including care <br/>
coordination and the effective use of health IT for the treatment and prevention of OUD). In this <br/>
proposed rule, we summarize some of these 2015 Edition certification criteria identified and <br/>
indicate how they support care coordination, the prevention of OUD and overdose, and the <br/>
detection of opioid misuse, abuse, and diversion.  <br/>
We have also below identified the proposals for revised or new 2015 Edition criteria <br/>
within this proposed rule that we believe can support clinical priorities, advance interoperability <br/>
for OUD (including care coordination and also the effective use of health IT for the treatment <br/>
and prevention of OUD). We welcome input from stakeholders specifically on these criteria <br/>
within the context of OUD prevention and treatment, as well as input on the identification of <br/>
other criteria included either in the 2015 Edition and/or that are proposed in other parts of this <br/>

and prevention.  <br/>

 <br/>
We have identified several 2015 Edition certification criteria available now for <br/>
certification in the Program which could support care coordination and the prevention and <br/>
detection of opioid misuse, abuse, and diversion. They are:  <br/>
•  The “transitions of care” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)) supports structured transition of care <br/>
summaries and referral summaries that help ensure the coordination and continuity of health <br/>
care as patients transfer between different clinicians at different health care organizations or <br/>
different levels of care within the same health care organization. This criteria supports the <br/>
ability to transmit a summary care record to support an individual with OUD upon discharge <br/>
from an inpatient setting or from a primary care provider to another setting for their care.  <br/>
•  The “clinical information reconciliation and incorporation” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(2)) allows <br/>
clinicians to reconcile and incorporate patient health information sent from external sources <br/>
to maintain a more accurate and up-to-date patient record. This process could help—for <br/>
example—reduce opioid related errors regarding patients who use multiple pharmacies, have <br/>
co-morbidity factors, and visit multiple clinicians.   <br/>
•  The “electronic prescribing” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(3)) provides a way to write and transmit <br/>
prescription information electronically. This criterion facilitates appropriate opioid <br/>
prescribing by simplifying the review of prescription information during follow-up visits or <br/>
transitions to other clinicians, by allowing prescribers to communicate prescription-related <br/>
messages to pharmacies electronically and by capturing and transmitting medication histories <br/>
that are shared with PDMPs. In this proposed rule, we propose to update the existing <br/>
electronic prescribing certification criterion as described in section IV.B.2 of this proposed <br/>
rule. <br/>

 <br/>
•  The “patient health information capture” (§ 170.315(e)(3)) allows clinicians to incorporate <br/>
unstructured patient generated health data or data from a non-clinical setting into a patient <br/>
record. The CMS Promoting Interoperability Programs for eligible hospitals includes a new <br/>
optional measure which is focused on verifying the existence of a signed Opioid Treatment <br/>
Agreement for certain patients when a controlled substance is prescribed and incorporating it <br/>
into the record. In the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems final rule, CMS <br/>
recognized this certification criterion’s potential to support this goal within a certified health <br/>
IT system (83 FR 41654). <br/>
•  The “social, psychological, and behavioral data” criterion (§170.315(a)(15)) can help to <br/>
provide a more complete view of a patient’s overall health status. This is important to help <br/>
provide a “whole-patient” approach to the treatment of substance use disorders included as <br/>
part of Medicated-Assisted Treatment (MAT) that involves the use of FDA-approved <br/>
medications, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to treat individuals <br/>
recovering from OUD. This data can help to improve care coordination and lead to the <br/>
identification of appropriate social supports and community resources. <br/>
We seek comment on how these criteria and what additional 2015 Edition certification <br/>
criteria may be considered a clinical and interoperability priority for supporting OUD treatment <br/>
and prevention.  We also seek comment on the value of developing a potential future non-<br/>
binding informational guide or resource to provide useful information for OUD providers and <br/>
sites of service related to specific clinical priorities and use cases of focus. <br/>

This proposed rule contains additional proposals to revise or add new criteria to the <br/>
Program to better support care across the continuum. We believe these criteria and standards, <br/>
highlighted below, can also support treatment and prevention of OUD. We seek comment <br/>
specifically on the applicability of these criteria to the OUD use case. They are: <br/>
•  <b>USCDI:</b> As detailed in section IV.B.1, we are proposing to adopt the USCDI as a standard (§ <br/>
170.213) which would establish a minimum set of data classes (including structured data <br/>
fields) that are required to be interoperable nationwide, and is designed to be expanded in an <br/>
iterative and predictable way over time. The USCDI Version 1 (USCDI v1) builds upon the <br/>
2015 Edition CCDS and includes a common set of data classes that can be supported by <br/>
commonly used standards. It includes the 2015 Edition CCDS data elements, such as <br/>
medications. It also includes two new data classes, titled “clinical notes” and “provenance,” <br/>
which would help facilitate interoperable exchange and the trustworthiness of the data being <br/>
exchanged. These enhancements to the comprehensiveness and reliability of the data being <br/>
exchanged could help empower physicians in the prevention and detection of opioid misuse, <br/>
abuse, and diversion.  <br/>
 <br/>
In addition, because we propose to adopt the USCDI as a standard, health IT developers <br/>
would be allowed to take advantage of the Maintenance of Certification requirements described <br/>
in section VII.B.5 of this proposed rule. Therefore, the USCDI would have the potential to <br/>
further benefit clinical priorities and interoperability for OUD, including safe and appropriate <br/>
opioid prescribing, through the ability to voluntarily implement and use a new version of an <br/>
adopted standard or implementation specification so long as certain conditions are met, including <br/>
the new version being approved by the National Coordinator for use in certification through the <br/>

support the access, exchange, and use of additional and future data classes (including structured <br/>

•  <b>Standardized API: </b>We are proposing new API functionality through the adoption of a new <br/>
API certification criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)), which serves to implement the Cures Act <br/>
requirement to permit health information to be accessed, exchanged, and used from APIs <br/>
without special effort. This criterion would enable efficient exchange of health information <br/>
using modern internet technologies and thus enable collaborative, patient-driven, integrated <br/>
care for individuals recovering from OUD.    <br/>

IV.B.7, we are also proposing to remove the current 2015 Edition DS4P-send (§ <br/>
170.315(b)(7)) and DS4P-receive (§ 170.315(b)(8)) certification criteria. We propose to <br/>
replace these two criteria with three new 2015 Edition DS4P certification criteria (two for C-<br/>
CDA ((§ 170.315(b)(12)) and (§ 170.315(b)(13)) and one for FHIR (§ 170.315(g)(11))) that <br/>
would support a more granular approach to privacy tagging data for health information <br/>
exchange supported by either the C-CDA- or FHIR-based exchange standards. We believe <br/>
this proposal would offer functionality that is more valuable to providers and patients, <br/>
especially given the complexities of the privacy law landscape for multiple care and specialty <br/>
settings. We also believe this proposal could lead to more complete records, contribute to <br/>
patient safety, and enhance care coordination. Additionally, we believe this proposal may <br/>
support a more usable display of OUD information at the request of patients within an EHR <br/>

•  <b>Electronic Prescribing and PDMPs:</b> As discussed in section IV.B.2, we are proposing to <br/>
remove the current 2015 Edition electronic prescribing certification criterion (§ <br/>
170.315(b)(3)) and replace this criterion with a new electronic prescribing certification <br/>
criterion (§ 170.315(b)(11)) that would support improved patient safety and prescription <br/>
accuracy, create workflow efficiencies, reduce testing requirements, and increase <br/>
configurability of systems. This new proposed criterion includes the addition of Risk <br/>
Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) messages. We believe this proposal would help <br/>
address challenges discussed in the CMS Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems <br/>
final rule (83 FR 41651) and Medicare Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule (83 FR 35704) <br/>
by strengthening clinical and administrative efficiency, helping move the industry forward by <br/>
adopting more current standards for electronic prescribing, and harmonizing efforts across <br/>
federal agencies in the prevention and treatment of OUD. In addition, the FDA has enacted <br/>
an opioids medications REMS program for opioid analgesics<a href="ONCs.html#151">49 </a>mandating prescriber and <br/>
patient education to encourage proper patient screening and appropriate monitoring. <br/>
Adoption of the new proposed criterion also supports the efficient and accurate exchange of <br/>
medication history transactions between providers and pharmacies, and between pharmacies <br/>
and state PDMPs.  <br/>

In addition to the certification criteria established in the 2015 Edition final rule and <br/>
proposed in this rule, ONC is engaged in a number of health IT and standards initiatives <br/>
exploring innovation and emerging standards to inform future health IT policy. In some cases, <br/>
these efforts may not be mature enough or best suited for adoption in the Program; however, we <br/>
seek comment on the potential consideration of these initiatives for future direction of ONC <br/>
policy.  <br/>
•  <b>CDS Hooks:</b> Improving how opioids are prescribed through evidence-based guidelines can <br/>
ensure patients have access to safer, more effective chronic pain treatment while reducing the <br/>
risk of opioid misuse, abuse, or overdose from these drugs. In response to the critical need <br/>
for consistent and current opioid prescribing guidelines, the Centers for Disease Control and <br/>
Prevention (CDC) released the Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain.<a href="ONCs.html#152">50 </a>While <br/>
progress has been made in training prescribers and fostering the adoption of the CDC <br/>
guideline, the President’s Opioid Commission<a href="ONCs.html#152">51 </a>acknowledged that “not all states have <br/>
adopted the guideline, not all physicians are aware of them, and sound opioid prescribing <br/>
guidelines are far from universally followed.” Clinical decision support (CDS) Hooks is a <br/>
health IT specification that has the potential to positively affect prescriber adoption of <br/>
evidence-based prescribing guidelines by invoking patient-specific clinical support from <br/>
within the clinician’s EHR workflow. ONC is currently collaborating with CDC on a project <br/>
to translate the CDC guideline into standardized, shareable, computable decision support <br/>
artifacts using CDS Hooks. We recognize that CDS Hooks is still an emerging technology <br/>

•  <b>Care Plan FHIR Resource: </b>A shared care plan is a critical concept for managing an <br/>
individual’s health across a continuum that includes both clinical and non-clinical settings<a href="ONCs.html#153">52</a> <br/>
and can help enable more informed and useful connections among all the stakeholders <br/>
engaged in preventing or treating OUD. For those in recovery from OUD, the care plan can <br/>
enable patients to access their care plan information and coordinate their care with approved <br/>
community care providers which is critical and part of evidence-based recovery treatment <br/>
services. In 2015, the ONC HITPC recommended that the National Coordinator accelerate <br/>
the implementation of dynamic, shared, longitudinal care plans that incorporate information <br/>
from both clinical and non-clinical services and empower individuals to manage their own <br/>
health and care.<a href="ONCs.html#153">53</a> A consideration for HHS as part of this earlier recommendation included <br/>
looking at the future standards development needed to transition from the static care plan <br/>
documentation (document template in C-CDA R2.1) to a dynamic shared care plan that <br/>
supports more robust care coordination.<a href="ONCs.html#153">54 </a>We believe HL7 standards and standardized APIs <br/>
can elevate care coordination and care management across the continuum, including for those <br/>
providers without EHRs, whether for opioid use disorder related treatment, primary health, or <br/>
other problems. Indeed, numerous efforts are underway within HL7 and other collaborations <br/>

to standardize “care plans” and their content using FHIR and the C-CDA. From a technical <br/>
perspective and in the context of the proposals focused on the USCDI standard, the ARCH <br/>
standard, the new proposed API certification criterion at 170.315(g)(10), and the voluntary <br/>
Standards Version Advancement Process Maintenance of Certification requirement described <br/>
in section VII.B.5 of this proposed rule, we can see a future where a (g)(10)-certified API <br/>
would be capable of supporting care plan data. We request public comment on the current <br/>
maturity of existing and forthcoming technical specifications to support care plan/care plan <br/>
data as well as specific information that could be prioritized within a future USCDI data class <br/>
focused on care plans. <br/>
In addition to commenting on the criteria noted in this section, we also encourage <br/>
stakeholders to participate in the ISA process.<a href="ONCs.html#154">55</a> The ISA represents the model by which ONC <br/>
coordinates the identification, assessment, and public awareness of interoperability standards and <br/>
implementation specifications. ONC encourages all stakeholders to implement and use the <br/>
standards and implementation specifications identified in the ISA as applicable to the specific <br/>
interoperability needs they seek to address and encourages pilot testing and other industry <br/>
experience adopting standards and implementation specifications identified as “emerging” in the <br/>
ISA. The web-based version of the ISA documents known limitations, preconditions, and <br/>
dependencies, and provide suggestions for security best practices in the form of security patterns <br/>
for referenced standards and implementation specifications when they are used to address a <br/>
specific clinical health IT interoperability need.  <br/>

 <br/>
Additionally, through the ISA process, stakeholders are encouraged to comment on the <br/>
outlined standards and implementation specifications, as ONC updates the ISA regularly. ONC <br/>
has developed and has plans to develop further ISA content to highlight standards and <br/>
implementation specifications that support the prevention and treatment of OUD/ substance use <br/>
disorder (SUD). For example, the NCPDP SCRIPT standard allows a prescriber to request a <br/>
patient’s medication history from a state PDMP via the RxHistoryRequest and <br/>
RxHistoryResponse. ONC is also working to enhance the ISA to make it easier for stakeholders <br/>
to find standards and implementation specifications related to high-priority use cases, such as <br/>
OUD/SUD. The ISA has a comment process that occurs each year56 and we encourage <br/>
stakeholders to participate in that process to comment on other standards and implementation <br/>
specifications that currently exist in the ISA or that the industry and its stakeholders feel should <br/>
be added to the ISA that support OUD/SUD prevention, treatment, monitoring, and care <br/>
coordination. <br/>
4. Additional Comment Areas <br/>
We further seek comment on effective approaches for the successful dissemination and <br/>
adoption of standards including the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard (see section IV.B.2) that <br/>
can support the exchange of PDMP data for integration into EHRs and also enable further <br/>
adoption and use of Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances (EPCS). Regarding <br/>
integration of health IT with PDMPs and EPCS, we believe there are real and perceived <br/>
challenges and opportunities that involve policy and technical components. As we explore these <br/>
issues in collaboration with industry and stakeholders, we seek comment on the priority <br/>

 <br/>
challenges and opportunities for these topics and on any technical and policy distinctions, as <br/>
appropriate.  <br/>
We also note that there are many federal initiatives separate from ONC proposed <br/>
rulemaking and the Program that exist within HHS programs including, but not limited to, CMS <br/>
Medicaid and Medicare programs. For example, Medicare now provides separate payment for <br/>
psychiatric collaborative care model/behavioral health integration and chronic care management <br/>
services (see 81 FR 80233, and 80247), and Medicaid issued guidance on leveraging technology <br/>
to address the opioid crisis at enhanced funding matches<a href="ONCs.html#156">56 </a>and also includes SUD health IT in <br/>
standard terms and conditions as part of 1115 waiver requirements.  <br/>
In addition, CMS sought comment for consideration through separate rulemaking in both <br/>
the 2019 Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule (83 FR 35923) and Hospital Inpatient <br/>
Prospective Payment Systems proposed rule (83 FR 20528) regarding whether they should adopt <br/>
the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard to facilitate future reporting of the proposed Query of <br/>
PDMP quality measure. As noted in the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems final <br/>
rule, a few commenters supported the use of NCPDP Script Standard Implementation Guide <br/>
Version 2017071 medication history transactions for PDMP queries and response. Additionally, <br/>
CMS encourages advances in standards and their use to deliver innovative, interoperable <br/>
solutions that will seamlessly integrate PDMP query functionality into clinician-friendly, patient-<br/>
centered CEHRT-enabled workflows that facilitate safer, more informed prescribing practices <br/>
and improved patient outcomes (83 FR 41651). <br/>

We seek comment on how successful implementation of health IT that supports OUD can <br/>
aid in the achievement of national and programmatic goals, especially where they may align with <br/>
initiatives across HHS and with stakeholder and industry led efforts. <br/>
Finally, we seek comment on a topic that involves health IT for both pediatric care and <br/>
OUD prevention and treatment – Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (or NAS).  In its September <br/>
2018 report, <i>Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General’s Spotlight on Opioids, </i>the <br/>
HHS Office of the Surgeon General describes how the incidence of Neonatal Abstinence <br/>
Syndrome (or NAS), has increased dramatically in the last decade along with increased opioid <br/>
misuse. Newborns may experience NAS, a withdrawal syndrome, following exposure to drugs <br/>
while in the mother’s womb. NAS is an expected and treatable condition following repeated <br/>
maternal substance use and abuse during pregnancy, which may have long-term health <br/>
consequences for the infant.  <br/>
Immediate newborn NAS signs include neurological excitability, gastrointestinal <br/>
dysfunction, and autonomic dysfunction. Newborns with NAS are more likely than other babies <br/>
to have low birthweight and respiratory complications. ONC believes the pediatric clinical health <br/>
IT recommendations proposed in this rule (including Priority 8, which includes the linkage of <br/>
health data in records of the mother and newborn) are important for supporting newborns at birth <br/>
and as they grow and receive care in various settings. As such, we invite comment on: <br/>
•  The effective use of health IT itself in support of the NAS use case as involves provider <br/>
training, establishing workflow, and other related safety and usability considerations. <br/>

<b>VII. Conditions and Maintenance of Certification </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
Section 4002 of the Cures Act requires the Secretary of HHS, through notice and <br/>
comment rulemaking, to establish Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements for <br/>
the Program. Specifically, health IT developers or entities must adhere to certain Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirements concerning information blocking; appropriate <br/>
exchange, access, and use of electronic health information; communications regarding health IT; <br/>
application programming interfaces (APIs); real world testing for interoperability; attestations <br/>
regarding certain Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements; and submission of <br/>
reporting criteria under the EHR reporting program. <br/>
<i>A.</i> <i>Implementation</i> <br/>
 <br/>
To implement Section 4002 of the Cures Act, we propose an approach whereby the <br/>
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification express both initial requirements for health IT <br/>
developers and their certified Health IT Module(s) as well as ongoing requirements that must be <br/>

met by both health IT developers and their certified Health IT Module(s) under the Program. If <br/>
these requirements are not met, then the health IT developer may no longer be able to participate <br/>
in the Program and/or its certified health IT may have its certification terminated. We propose to <br/>
implement each Cures Act Condition of Certification with further specificity as it applies to the <br/>
Program. We also propose to establish the Maintenance of Certification requirements for each <br/>
Condition of Certification as standalone requirements. This approach would establish clear <br/>
baseline technical and behavior Conditions of Certification requirements with evidence that the <br/>
Conditions of Certification are continually being met through the Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirements. <br/>
<i>B. Provisions </i><br/>
 <br/>
1. Information Blocking <br/>
The Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification under the Program, not take any action that constitutes &#34;information blocking&#34; as <br/>
defined in section 3022(a) of the PHSA (see 3001(c)(5)(D)(i) of the PHSA). We propose to <br/>
establish this information blocking Condition of Certification in § 170.401. The Condition of <br/>
Certification prohibits any health IT developer under the Program from taking any action that <br/>
constitutes information blocking as defined by section 3022(a) of the PHSA and proposed in <br/>
§ 171.103.  <br/>
 <br/>
We clarify that this proposed “information blocking” Condition of Certification and its <br/>
requirements would be substantive requirements of the Program and would use the definition of <br/>
&#34;information blocking&#34; established by section 3022(a) of the PHSA and as also proposed in § <br/>
171.103, as it relates to health IT developers of certified health IT. In addition to ONC's statutory <br/>

The<b> </b>Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification under the Program, provide assurances to the Secretary, unless for legitimate <br/>
purposes specified by the Secretary, that it will not take any action that constitutes information <br/>
blocking as defined in section 3022(a) of the PHSA, or any other action that may inhibit the <br/>
appropriate exchange, access, and use of electronic health information (EHI). We propose to <br/>
implement this Condition of Certification and accompanying Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirements in § 170.402. As a Condition of Certification requirement, a health IT developer <br/>
must comply with the Condition as recited here and in the Cures Act. We refer readers to section <br/>

VIII of this proposed rule for the proposed reasonable and necessary activities specified by the <br/>
Secretary, which constitute the exceptions to the information blocking definition.  <br/>
We also propose to establish more specific Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirements for a health IT developer to provide assurances that it does not take any action that <br/>
may inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of EHI. These proposed requirements <br/>
serve to provide further clarity under the Program as to how health IT developers can provide <br/>
such broad assurances with more specific actions.  <br/>
a. Full Compliance and Unrestricted Implementation of Certification Criteria <br/>
Capabilities  <br/>
 <br/>
We propose, as a Condition of Certification, that a health IT developer must ensure that <br/>
its health IT certified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program) conforms to <br/>
the full scope of the certification criteria to which its health IT is certified. This has always been an <br/>
expectation of ONC and users of certified health IT and, importantly, a requirement of the Program. <br/>
We believe, however, that by incorporating this expectation and requirement as a Condition of <br/>
Certification under the Program, there would be assurances, and documentation via the <br/>
“Attestations” Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements proposed in § 170.406, <br/>
that all health IT developers fully understand their responsibilities under the Program, including not <br/>
to take any action with their certified health IT that may inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, <br/>
and use of EHI. To this point, certification criteria are designed and issued so that certified health <br/>
IT can support interoperability and the appropriate exchange, access, and use of electronic health <br/>
information. <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that, as a complementary Condition of Certification, health IT developers of <br/>
certified health IT must provide an assurance that they have made certified capabilities available <br/>
in ways that enable them to be implemented and used in production environments for their <br/>
intended purposes. More specifically, developers would be prohibited from taking any action that <br/>
could interfere with a user’s ability to access or use certified capabilities for any purpose within <br/>
the scope of the technology’s certification. Such actions may inhibit the appropriate access, <br/>
exchange, or use of EHI and are therefore contrary to this proposed Condition of Certification <br/>
and the statutory provision that it implements. While such actions are already prohibited under <br/>
the Program (80 FR 62711), making these existing requirements explicit would ensure that <br/>
health IT developers are required to attest to them on a regular basis pursuant to the Condition of <br/>
Certification proposed in § 170.406, which will in turn provide additional assurances to the <br/>
Secretary that developers of certified health IT support and do not inhibit appropriate access, <br/>
exchange, or use of EHI.  <br/>
By way of example, actions that would violate this aspect of the proposed Condition <br/>
include failing to fully deploy or enable certified capabilities; imposing limitations (including <br/>
restrictions) on the use of certified capabilities once deployed; or requiring subsequent developer <br/>
assistance to enable the use of certified capabilities, contrary to the intended uses and outcomes <br/>
of those capabilities (<i>see</i> 80 FR 62711). The Condition would also be violated were a developer <br/>
to refuse to provide documentation, support, or other assistance reasonably necessary to enable <br/>
the use of certified capabilities for their intended purposes (<i>see</i> 80 FR 62711). More generally, <br/>
any action that would be likely to substantially impair the ability of one or more users (or <br/>
prospective users) to implement or use certified capabilities for any purpose within the scope of <br/>

applicable certification criteria would be prohibited by this Condition (<i>see</i> 80 FR 62711). Such <br/>
actions may include imposing limitations or additional types of costs, especially if these were not <br/>
disclosed when a customer purchased or licensed the certified health IT (<i>see</i> 80 FR 62711). <br/>
b. Certification to the “Electronic Health Information Export” Criterion  <br/>
We propose, as a Condition of Certification requirement, that a health IT developer that <br/>
produces and electronically manages EHI must certify health IT to the 2015 Edition “electronic <br/>
health information export” certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(10). We discuss the proposed <br/>
“electronic health information (EHI) export” criterion in section IV.B.4 of this proposed rule. <br/>
Further, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement, we propose that a health IT developer <br/>
that produces and electronically manages EHI must provide all of its customers of certified <br/>
health IT with health IT certified to the functionality included in § 170.315(b)(10) within 24 <br/>
months of a subsequent final rule’s effective date or within 12 months of certification for a health <br/>
IT developer that never previously certified health IT to the 2015 Edition, whichever is longer. <br/>
Consistent with these proposals, we also propose to amend §<b> </b>170.550 to require that ONC-ACBs <br/>
certify health IT to the proposed 2015 Edition “EHI export” when the health IT developer of the <br/>
health IT presented for certification produces and electronically manages EHI.  <br/>
As discussed in section IV.C.1 of this proposed rule, the availability of the capabilities in <br/>
the proposed 2015 Edition “EHI export” certification criterion to providers and patients would <br/>
promote access, exchange, and use of EHI to facilitate health care providers in switching <br/>
practices and health IT systems and patients’ electronic access to all their health information <br/>
stored by a provider. As such, health IT developers with health IT certified to the proposed 2015 <br/>
Edition “EHI export” certification criterion that is made available to its customers provides <br/>

 <br/>
assurances that the developer is not taking actions that constitute information blocking or any <br/>
other action that may inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of EHI. <br/>
c. Records and Information Retention <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement, a health IT developer <br/>
must, for a period of 10 years beginning from the date of certification, retain all records and <br/>
information necessary that demonstrate initial and ongoing compliance with the requirements of <br/>
the ONC Health IT Certification Program. In other words, records and information should be <br/>
retained starting from the date a developer first certifies health IT under the Program and applies <br/>
separately to each unique Health IT Module (or Complete EHR, as applicable) certified under <br/>
the Program. This retention of records is necessary to verify health IT developer compliance with <br/>
Program requirements, including certification criteria and Conditions of Certification. We <br/>
believe that 10 years is an appropriate period of time given that many users of certified health IT <br/>
participate in various CMS programs, as well as other programs, that require similar periods of <br/>
records retention. We also refer readers to section VII.D.3.c of this preamble for additional <br/>
discussion of records access to information necessary to enforce the Conditions and Maintenance <br/>
of Certification. <br/>
 <br/>
In an effort to reduce administrative burden, we also propose, that in situations where <br/>
applicable certification criteria are removed from the Code of Federal Regulations before the 10 <br/>
years have expired, records must only be kept for 3 years from the date of removal for those <br/>
certification criteria and related Program provisions unless that timeframe would exceed the <br/>
overall 10-year retention period. This “3-year from the date of removal” records retention period <br/>

 <br/>
also aligns with the records retention requirements for ONC-ACBs and ONC-ATLs under the <br/>
Program. <br/>
 <br/>
We encourage comment on these proposals and whether the proposed requirements can <br/>
provide adequate assurances that certified health IT developers are demonstrating initial and <br/>
ongoing compliance with the requirements of the Program; and thereby ensuring that certified <br/>
health IT can support interoperability, and appropriate exchange, access, and use of EHI.  <br/>
d. Trusted Exchange Framework and the Common Agreement – Request for <br/>
Information <br/>
The Cures Act added section 3001(c)(9) to the PHSA, which requires the National <br/>
Coordinator to work with stakeholders with the goal of developing or supporting a Trusted <br/>
Exchange Framework and a Common Agreement (collectively, “TEFCA”) for the purpose of <br/>
ensuring full network-to-network exchange of health information. Section 3001(c)(9)(B) outlines <br/>
a process for establishing a TEFCA between health information networks (HINs)—including <br/>
provisions for the National Coordinator, in collaboration with the NIST, to provide technical <br/>
assistance on implementation and pilot testing of the TEFCA. In accordance with section <br/>
3001(c)(9)(C), the National Coordinator shall publish the TEFCA on its website and in the <br/>
<b>Federal Register,</b> as well as annually publish on its website a directory of the HINs that have <br/>
adopted the Common Agreement and are capable of trusted exchange pursuant to the Common <br/>
Agreement. The process, application, and construction of the TEFCA are further outlined in <br/>
section 3001(c)(9)(D), including requiring that the Secretary shall through notice and comment <br/>
rulemaking, establish a process for HINs that voluntarily adopt the TEFCA to attest to such <br/>
adoption. We request comment as to whether certain health IT developers should be required to <br/>

 <br/>
participate in the TEFCA as a means of providing assurances to their customers and ONC that <br/>
they are not taking actions that constitute information blocking or any other action that may <br/>
inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of EHI. We would expect that such a <br/>
requirement, if proposed in a subsequent rulemaking, would apply to health IT developers that <br/>
have a Health IT Module(s) certified to any of the certification criteria in §§ 170.315(b)(1), <br/>
(c)(1) and (c)(2), (e)(1), (f), and (g)(9) through (11); and provide services for connection to <br/>
health information networks (HINs). These services could be routing EHI through a HIN or <br/>
responding to requests for EHI from a HIN.  <br/>
We have identified health IT developers that certify health IT to the criteria above <br/>
because the capabilities included in the criteria support access and exchange of EHI. Therefore, <br/>
we believe such health IT developers, as opposed to a health IT developer that only supports <br/>
clinical decision support (§ 170.315(a)(9)) with its certified health IT, would be best suited to <br/>
participate in the Trusted Exchange Framework and adhere to the Common Agreement. <br/>
Similarly, we believe that many such health IT developers with the identified certified health IT <br/>
would be in position, and requested by customers, to provide connection services to HINs. When <br/>
such criteria are met (certified to the identified criteria above and actually providing connection <br/>
services), participation in the Trusted Exchange Framework and adherence to the Common <br/>
Agreement are consistent with this Condition and Maintenance of Certification as specified by <br/>
the Cures Act, the intent of Congress to establish widespread interoperability and exchange of <br/>
health information without information blocking, and supports ONC’s responsibility, as <br/>
established by the HITECH Act, to develop and support a nationwide health IT infrastructure <br/>
that allows for the electronic use and exchange of information. More specifically, by <br/>

would serve as a basis for health IT developer participation in the Trusted Exchange Framework <br/>
and adherence to the Common Agreement, and whether the current structure of the Trusted <br/>
Exchange Framework and Common Agreement are conducive to health IT developer <br/>
participation and in what manner.<b> </b><br/>
3. Communications <br/>
 <br/>
The Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification under the Program, does not prohibit or restrict communication regarding the <br/>
following subjects: <br/>
•  The usability of the health information technology; <br/>
•  The interoperability of the health information technology; <br/>
•  The security of the health information technology; <br/>
•  Relevant information regarding users' experiences when using the health information <br/>
technology; <br/>

 <br/>
•  The business practices of developers of health information technology related to exchanging <br/>
electronic health information; and <br/>
•  The manner in which a user of the health information technology has used such technology. <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to implement this Condition of Certification and its requirements in § <br/>
170.403. The Cures Act placed no limitations on the protection of the communications <br/>
delineated above (referred to hereafter as “protected communications”). As such, we propose to <br/>
broadly interpret the subject matter of communications that are protected from developer <br/>
prohibition or restriction as well as the conduct of developers that implicate the protection <br/>
afforded to communications by this Condition of Certification and discuss this proposed <br/>
approach in detail below. While we propose to implement a broad general prohibition against <br/>
developers imposing prohibitions and restrictions on protected communications, we also <br/>
recognize that there are circumstances where it is both legitimate and reasonable for developers <br/>
to limit the sharing of information about their products. As such, we propose to allow developers <br/>
to impose prohibitions or restrictions on protected communications in certain narrowly defined <br/>
circumstances. In order for a prohibition or restriction on a protected communication to be <br/>
permitted, we propose that it must pass a two-part test. First, the communication that is being <br/>
prohibited or restricted must not fall within a class of communication about which no restriction <br/>
or prohibition would ever be legitimate or reasonable—such as communications required by law, <br/>
made to a government agency, or made to a defined category of safety organizations—and which <br/>
we refer to hereafter as “communications with unqualified protection.” Second, to be permitted, <br/>
a developer’s prohibition or restriction must also fall within a prescribed category of <br/>
circumstances for which we propose it is both legitimate and reasonable for a developer to limit <br/>

the sharing of information about its products. This would be because of the nature of the <br/>
relationship between the developer and the communicator or because of the nature of the <br/>
information that is, or could be, the subject of the communication (referred to hereafter as <br/>
“permitted prohibitions and restrictions”). A restriction or prohibition that does not satisfy this <br/>
two-part test will contravene this Condition of Certification. As discussed in more detail below, <br/>
we propose that this two-part test strikes a reasonable balance between the need to promote open <br/>
communication about health IT and related business practices, and the need to protect the <br/>
legitimate interests of health IT developers and other entities. <br/>
a. Background and Purpose  <br/>
 <br/>
This Condition of Certification addresses industry practices that severely limit the ability <br/>
and willingness of health IT customers, users, researchers, and other stakeholders who use and <br/>
work with health IT to openly discuss and share their experiences and other relevant information <br/>
about the performance of health IT, including the ability of health IT to exchange health <br/>
information electronically. These practices result in a lack of transparency around health IT that <br/>
can contribute to and exacerbate patient safety risks, system security vulnerabilities, and product <br/>
performance issues. As discussed below, these issues have been documented and reported on <br/>
over a number of years.  <br/>
 <br/>
The challenges presented by health IT developer actions that prohibit or restrict <br/>
communications have been examined for some time. The problem was identified in a 2012 report <br/>
by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (IOM) entitled “Health IT and Patient <br/>

 <br/>
The issue of health IT developers prohibiting or restricting communications about health <br/>
IT has been the subject of a series of hearings by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, <br/>
Labor and Pensions (HELP Committee), starting in the spring of 2015. During several hearings, <br/>
stakeholders emphasized the lack of transparency around the performance of health IT in a live <br/>
environment, noting that this can undermine a competitive marketplace, hinder innovation, and <br/>
prevent improvements in the safety and usability of the technology.<a href="ONCs.html#171">65, 66</a> Additionally, the HELP <br/>
Committee indicated serious concerns regarding the reported efforts of health IT developers to <br/>
restrict, by contract and other means, communications regarding user experience, including <br/>
information relevant to safety and interoperability.<a href="ONCs.html#171">67 </a>When one Senator asked a panel of <br/>
experts—which included a health IT developer—if there were any reasons for health IT contracts <br/>
to have confidentiality clauses restricting users of health information technology from discussing <br/>
their experience of using the health IT, all panel members agreed that such clauses should be <br/>
prohibited.<a href="ONCs.html#171">68</a> <br/>
 <br/>
Prior to the HELP Committee hearings described above, the issue of developers <br/>
prohibiting and restricting communications about the performance of their health IT was also <br/>

addressed in House Energy and Commerce Committee hearings when committee members heard <br/>
testimony and held discussions related to the Cures Act.<a href="ONCs.html#172">69 </a>Commentary by witnesses at the <br/>
hearings emphasized the need to ensure that health IT products are safe and encouraged the <br/>
availability of information around health IT products to improve quality and ensure patient <br/>
safety. <br/>
Developer actions that prohibit or restrict communications about health IT have also been <br/>
the subject of investigative reporting.<a href="ONCs.html#172">70</a> A September 2015 report examined eleven contracts <br/>
between health systems and major health IT developers and found that, with one exception, all of <br/>
the contracts protected large amounts of information from being disclosed, including information <br/>
related to safety and performance issues.<a href="ONCs.html#172">71 </a>The report stated that broad confidentiality and <br/>
intellectual property protection clauses were the greatest barriers to allowing the communication <br/>
of information regarding potential safety issues and adverse events.<a href="ONCs.html#172">72</a> <br/>
 <br/>
Finally, ONC has itself been made aware of health IT developer contract language that <br/>
purports to prohibit the disclosure of information about health IT, including even a customer’s or <br/>
user’s opinions and conclusions about the performance and other aspects of the technology. Our <br/>
extensive interactions with health care providers, researchers, and other stakeholders consistently <br/>
indicate that such terms are not uncommon and that some developers may actively enforce them <br/>
and engage in other practices to discourage communications regarding developers’ health IT <br/>
products and related business practices.  <br/>

 <br/>
This proposed Condition of Certification is needed to significantly improve transparency <br/>
around the functioning of health IT in the field. This will help ensure that the health IT ultimately <br/>
selected and used by health care providers and others functions as expected, is less likely to have <br/>
safety issues or implementation difficulties, enables greater interoperability of health <br/>
information, and more fully allows users to reap the benefits of health IT utilization, including <br/>
improvements in care and quality, and reductions in costs. <br/>
b.<b> </b>Condition of Certification Requirements <br/>
i. Protected Communications and Communicators <br/>
  <br/>
We propose that the protection afforded to communicators under this Condition of <br/>
Certification would apply irrespective of the form or medium in which the communication is <br/>
made. Developers must not prohibit or restrict communications whether written, oral, electronic <br/>
or by any other method if they concern protected communications, unless permitted otherwise by <br/>
this Condition of Certification. Similarly, this Condition of Certification does not impose any <br/>
limit on the identity of the communicators that are able to benefit from the protection afforded, <br/>
except that employees and contractors of a health IT developer may be treated differently when <br/>
making communications that are not afforded unqualified protection under § 170.403(a)(2)(i). <br/>
This Condition of Certification is not limited to communications by health IT customers (e.g., <br/>
providers) who have contracts with health IT developers. Entities or individuals who enter into <br/>
agreements with a developer in connection with the developer’s health IT – for example, a data <br/>
analytics vendor who is required to sign a non-disclosure agreement before being granted access <br/>
to the developer’s health IT – would also be covered by the protection afforded to <br/>
communicators under this Condition of Certification. Patients, health IT researchers, industry <br/>

groups, and health information exchanges would be able to make protected communications <br/>
about the health IT free of impermissible prohibitions or restrictions. Similarly, the Condition of <br/>
Certification would also extend to potential customers of health IT who are provided with <br/>
product or software demonstrations, irrespective of whether they proceed with the acquisition of <br/>
the technology. Examples of other protected communications include, but are not limited to:  <br/>
•  a post made to an online forum;  <br/>
•  the sharing of screenshots, subject to certain proposed restrictions on their general <br/>
publication; <br/>
•  an unattributed written review by a health IT user;  <br/>
•  a quote given by a health care executive to a journalist;  <br/>
•  a presentation given at a trade show;  <br/>
•  a social media post;  <br/>
•  a product review posted on a video-sharing service such as YouTube;  <br/>
•  the statements and conclusions made in a peer-reviewed journal; and  <br/>
•  private communications made between health IT customers about the health IT. <br/>
ii. Protected Subject Areas <br/>
 <br/>
The Cures Act (and § 170.403(a)(1)) identifies a list of subject areas about which <br/>
developers cannot prohibit or restrict communications. These subject areas address health IT <br/>
performance and usability, health IT security, and the business practices related to exchanging <br/>
EHI. For the reasons discussed below, we propose that the terms used to describe the subject <br/>
areas should be construed broadly, consistent with the scope of communications that Congress <br/>

specified in the Act. We encourage comment on whether the types of subject matter we identify <br/>
below are adequate to protect the full range of communications contemplated by the Cures Act.   <br/>
<i>(A) Usability of Health Information Technology<b> </b></i><br/>
The term “usability” is not defined in the Cures Act nor in any other relevant statutory <br/>
provisions. In the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Usability Initiative, <br/>
NIST describes “usability” of health IT by referencing the ISO<a href="ONCs.html#175">73</a> standard, ISO9241: usability is <br/>
&#34;the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with <br/>
effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.&#34;<a href="ONCs.html#175">74 </a>Separately, HIMSS<a href="ONCs.html#175">75 </a><br/>
has recognized the following principles of software usability: Simplicity; Naturalness; <br/>
Consistency; Forgiveness and Feedback; Effective Use of Language; Efficient Interactions; <br/>
Effective Information Presentation; Preservation of Context; and Minimize Cognitive Load.<a href="ONCs.html#175">76</a> As <br/>
these organizations have expressed, there are a multitude of factors that contribute to any <br/>
judgment about “usability,” and any assessment about the usability of health IT should <br/>
appropriately rest on the factors contributing to the effectiveness, efficiency, and performance <br/>
offered. As such, we propose that the “usability” of health IT be construed broadly to include <br/>
both an overall judgment on the “usability” of a particular health IT product, as well as any <br/>
factor that contributes to usability. Factors of usability that could be the subject of protected <br/>
communications include, but are not limited to: the user interface (i.e., what a user sees on the <br/>

<i>(B) Interoperability of Health Information Technology<b> </b></i><br/>
  <br/>
Section 3000(9) of the PHSA, as amended by the Cures Act, provides a definition of <br/>
“interoperability” that describes a type of health IT that demonstrates the necessary capabilities <br/>
to be interoperable. For the purposes of this Condition of Certification, we propose that protected <br/>
communications regarding the “interoperability of health IT” would include communications <br/>
about whether a health IT product and associated developer business practices meet the <br/>
interoperability definition described in section 3000(9) of the PHSA, including communications <br/>
about aspects of the technology or developer that fall short of the expectations found in that <br/>
definition. This will include communications about the interoperability capabilities of health IT <br/>
and the practices of a health IT developer that may inhibit the access, exchange, or use of EHI, <br/>
including information blocking.<b> </b><br/>
<i>(C) Security of Health IT<b> </b></i><br/>
 <br/>
The security of health information technology is primarily addressed under the HIPAA <br/>
Security Rule<a href="ONCs.html#176">77</a>, which establishes national standards to protect individuals’ electronic protected <br/>
health information (ePHI) that is created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a covered entity <br/>
or business associate. Covered entities and business associates must ensure the confidentiality, <br/>

integrity, and availability of all such ePHI; protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or <br/>
hazards to the security or integrity of such information; and protect against any reasonably <br/>
anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are not permitted or required under the <br/>
HIPAA Privacy Rule.<a href="ONCs.html#177">78</a> HIPAA requires that health IT developers, to the extent that they are <br/>
business associates of HIPAA-covered entities, implement appropriate administrative, physical, <br/>
and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of ePHI. <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that the matters that fall within the topic of health IT security should be <br/>
broadly construed to include any safeguards, whether or not required by the Security Rule, that <br/>
may be implemented (or not implemented) by a developer to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, <br/>
and security of the wider set of EHI (including ePHI), together with the health IT product’s <br/>
performance regarding security. For example, a developer may not prohibit or restrict a potential <br/>
communicator from communicating about, without limitation:  <br/>
•  the approach to security adopted for the health IT at issue (e.g., architectural approach or <br/>
authentication methodology);  <br/>
•  the resilience of the health IT;  <br/>
•  identified security flaws in the developer’s health IT; or   <br/>
•  the response to cyber threats or security breaches by the developer. <br/>
<i>(D) User Experiences<b> </b></i><br/>
 <br/>
The phrase “user experience” is not defined in the Cures Act nor in any other relevant <br/>
statutory provisions. We propose to afford these terms their ordinary meaning. To qualify as a <br/>
“user experience,” the experience must be one that is had by a user of health IT. However, <br/>
                                                 <br/>
78 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164. <br/>

<a name=178></a>RIN 0955-AA01                                                                                                    Page <b>178</b> of <b>724</b> <br/>
 <br/>
beyond this, we do not propose to qualify the types of experiences that would receive protection <br/>
under the Condition on the basis of the “user experience” subject area. This reflects the great <br/>
variety of experiences that users may have with health IT and the often subjective nature of such <br/>
experiences. Thus, we believe that if the user had the experience, the experience is relevant. <br/>
 <br/>
To illustrate the breadth of potential user experiences that would be protected by this <br/>
Condition of Certification, we propose that communications about “relevant information <br/>
regarding users' experiences when using the health IT” would encompass, for example, <br/>
communications and information about a person or organization’s experience acquiring, <br/>
implementing, using, or otherwise interacting with health IT. This includes experiences <br/>
associated with the use of the health IT in the delivery of health care, together with <br/>
administrative functions performed using the health IT. User experiences would also include the <br/>
experiences associated with configuring and using the technology throughout implementation, <br/>
training, and in practice. Further, user experiences would include patients’ and consumers’ user <br/>
experiences with consumer apps, patient portals, and other consumer-facing technologies. To be <br/>
clear, a “relevant user experience” includes any aspect of the health IT user experience that could <br/>
positively or negatively impact the effectiveness or performance of the health IT.  <br/>
<i>(E) Manner in Which a User has Used Health IT<b> </b></i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose that protected communications regarding the “manner in which a user has <br/>
used health IT” would encompass any information related to how the health IT has been used in <br/>
practice. This subject area largely overlaps with the matters covered under the “user experience” <br/>
subject area but may include additional perspectives or details beyond those experienced by a <br/>

user of health IT. Types of information that would fall within this subject area include but are not <br/>
limited to:  <br/>
•  information about a work-around implemented to overcome an issue in the health IT;  <br/>
•  customizations built on top of core health IT functionality;  <br/>
•  the specific conditions under which a user used the health IT, such as information about <br/>
constraints imposed on health IT functionality due to implementation decisions; and  <br/>
•  information about the ways in which health IT could not be used or did not function as was <br/>
represented by the developer.  <br/>
<i>(F) Business Practices Related to Exchange<b> </b></i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose that the subject matter of “developer business practices related to exchanging <br/>
electronic health information” should be broadly construed to include developer policies and <br/>
practices that facilitate the exchange of electronic health information, and developer policies and <br/>
practices that impact the ability of health IT to exchange health information. We further propose <br/>
that the exchange of electronic health information encompasses the appropriate and timely <br/>
sharing of electronic health information. <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that protected communications include, but are not limited to:  <br/>
•  the costs charged by a developer for products or services that support the exchange of <br/>
electronic health information (e.g., interface costs, API licensing fees and royalties, <br/>
maintenance and subscription fees, transaction or usage-based costs for exchanging <br/>
information);  <br/>

 <br/>
•  the timeframes and terms on which developers will or will not enable connections and <br/>
facilitate exchange with other technologies, individuals, or entities, including other health IT <br/>
developers, exchanges, and networks;  <br/>
•  the developer’s approach to participation in health information exchanges and/or networks; <br/>
•  the developer’s licensing practices and terms as it relates to making available APIs and other <br/>
aspects of its technology that enable the development and deployment of interoperable <br/>
products and services; and  <br/>
•  the developer’s approach to creating interfaces with third-party products or services, <br/>
including whether connections are treated as “one off” customizations, or whether similar <br/>
types of connections can be implemented at a reduced cost.  <br/>
Importantly, we further propose that information regarding business practices related to <br/>
exchanging electronic health information would include information about the switching costs <br/>
imposed by a developer, as we are aware that the cost of switching health IT is a significant <br/>
factor impacting health care providers adopting the most exchange-friendly health IT products <br/>
that are available. <br/>
iii. Meaning of “Prohibit or Restrict”<i> </i><br/>

The terms “prohibit” and “restrict” are not defined in the Cures Act or in any other <br/>
relevant statutory provisions. As discussed in detail below, communications can be prohibited or <br/>
restricted through contractual terms or agreements (e.g., non-disclosure agreements, non-<br/>

practices that are designed to create powerful disincentives to engaging in communications about <br/>

agreements) and would encompass any conduct by a developer that would be likely to restrict a <br/>
communication or class of communications protected by this Condition, as discussed in detail <br/>
below.  <br/>
 <br/>
The conduct in question must have some nexus to the making of a protected <br/>
communication or an attempted or contemplated protected communication. That is, conduct by a <br/>
developer that may be perceived as intimidating or punitive would not implicate this Condition <br/>
of Certification unless that conduct was designed to directly or indirectly influence the making of <br/>
a protected communication. Similarly, health IT contracts may include terms that govern the <br/>
manner in which the parties conduct themselves, and those terms would not implicate this <br/>
Condition of Certification unless the operative effect of a term was to restrict or prohibit a <br/>
protected communication. For abundant clarity, we note that the fact that a customer’s health IT <br/>
product is not performing in the manner the customer expected, or in the manner that the <br/>
developer promised, would not, in itself be evidence that the developer is engaging in conduct <br/>
that restricts or prohibits a protected communication. Rather, a nexus must exist between the <br/>
alleged poor performance and the making of (or attempting or contemplating to make) a <br/>
protected communication. <br/>
We note that contractual prohibitions or restrictions on communications can, in limited <br/>
circumstances, be legitimate and serve an important role in protecting proprietary information <br/>
and intellectual property that are essential for health IT developers to innovate and compete. On <br/>
this basis, we propose to permit certain types of prohibitions and restrictions, subject to strict <br/>

 <br/>
conditions to ensure that they are narrowly tailored and do not restrict protected communications. <br/>
These permitted prohibitions and restrictions are discussed in section VII.B.3.b.v below. <br/>
<i>(A) Prohibitions or Restrictions Arising by Way of Contract<b> </b></i><br/>
 <br/>
The principal way that health IT developers can control the disclosure of information <br/>
about their health IT is through contractual prohibitions or restrictions. Such prohibitions or <br/>
restrictions can arise in contractual provisions that address, for example, confidentiality <br/>
obligations, intellectual property protections, hold-harmless requirements, nondisclosure <br/>
obligations, non-compete obligations, and publicity rights.   <br/>
There are different ways that contractual prohibitions or restrictions arise. In some <br/>
instances a contractual prohibition or restriction will be expressed, and the precise nature and <br/>
scope of the prohibition or restriction will be explicit from the face of the contract or agreement. <br/>
For example, a contract will say that the health IT customer must not disclose screenshots of the <br/>
health IT. However, more often, a contract will impose prohibitions or restrictions in less precise <br/>
terms. For example, a health IT contract might use broad language when describing the <br/>
information or materials that customers and users are forbidden from disclosing pursuant to a <br/>
confidentiality clause, casting a vague net over the developer’s “proprietary” information and <br/>
purporting to cover information that may be neither confidential, secret, nor protected by law. A <br/>
contract does not need to expressly prohibit or restrict a protected communication in order to <br/>
have the effect of prohibiting or restricting that protected communication. The use of broad or <br/>
vague language that obfuscates the types of communications that can and cannot be made may <br/>
be treated as a prohibition or restriction if it has the effect of restricting legitimate <br/>
communications about health IT. <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Restrictions and prohibitions found in contracts used by developers to sell or license their <br/>
health IT products can apply to customers directly and can require that the customer “flow-<br/>
down” obligations onto the customer’s employees, contractors, and other individuals or entities <br/>
that use or work with the developer’s health IT. Such contract provisions would not comply with <br/>
this Condition of Certification if they prohibit or restrict protected communications. Prohibitions <br/>
or restrictions on communications can also be found in separate nondisclosure agreements <br/>
(NDAs) that developers require their customers—and in some instances the users of the health <br/>
IT—to enter into in order to receive or access the health IT. We propose that such agreements are <br/>
covered by this Condition of Certification. Finally, health IT developers typically may require <br/>
third-party contractors used by their customers (such as a data analytics vendor engaged by a <br/>
health care provider to analyze the provider’s data) to enter into a NDA with the developer <br/>
before commencing their contract activities. In some extreme cases, the employees of these <br/>
third-party contractors are required to sign NDAs in their personal capacities. These NDAs <br/>
typically include obligations that prohibit or restrict communications about the developer’s <br/>
health IT products, and we propose that any such prohibitions or restrictions within the context <br/>
of protected communications as defined here would be subject to this Condition of Certification. <br/>
<i>(B) Prohibitions or Restrictions that Arise by Way of Conduct<b> </b></i><br/>
 <br/>
We are aware that some health IT developers engage in conduct that has the effect of <br/>
prohibiting or restricting protected communications. This conduct may arise despite the <br/>
developer’s contract and/or business associate agreement being silent on, or even expressly <br/>
permitting, the protected communication. The effect of such conduct can be significant, as health <br/>
care providers are dependent on their health IT developer in order to receive critical software <br/>

updates or other maintenance services, and sometimes have little bargaining power. Similarly, a <br/>
third-party developer is dependent on a health IT developer’s authorization in order to perform <br/>
work in connection with the developer’s health IT. <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that conduct that has the effect of prohibiting or restricting a protected <br/>
communication would be subject to this Condition of Certification. We emphasize that, as <br/>
discussed above, the conduct in question must have some nexus to the making of a protected <br/>
communication or an attempted or contemplated protected communication. As such, developer <br/>
conduct that was alleged to be intimidating, or health IT performance that was perceived to be <br/>
substandard, would not, in and of itself, implicate this Condition of Certification unless there was <br/>
some nexus between the conduct or performance issue and the making of (or attempting or <br/>
threatening to make) a protected communication. Examples of conduct that could implicate this <br/>
Condition of Certification include, but are not limited to: <br/>
•  Taking steps to enforce, including by threatening to enforce, a right arising under contract <br/>
that contravenes this Condition of Certification. <br/>
•  Taking steps to enforce, including by threatening to enforce, a legal right that purports to <br/>
prohibit or restrict a protected communication. This would include, for example, the making <br/>
of threats, such as via a cease and desist letter, to a researcher who has made a protected <br/>
communication. <br/>
•  Employing a technological measure (within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. § 1201) that a user <br/>
would have to circumvent in order to make a protected communication, for example, a <br/>
technological measure that a health IT user would need to circumvent in order to take a <br/>
screenshot of the developer’s health IT. <br/>

•  Discouraging the making of protected communications by:  <br/>
o  Making threats against a health care customer (e.g., by threatening to withhold the <br/>
latest version of the developer’s software) in response to the customer making or <br/>
attempting to make a protected communication. <br/>
o  Taking retaliatory action against a person or entity that has made a protected <br/>
communication (e.g., withholding support, delaying the provider’s adoption of a new <br/>
software release, or removing a provider from the developer’s “preferred customer” <br/>
list). <br/>
•  Having policies that disadvantage persons or entities that make protected communications <br/>
(e.g., a policy that bars a provider from qualifying for the developer’s “preferred customer” <br/>
list if it shares screenshots in a manner protected by this Condition of Certification). <br/>
•  Refusing to publish—or refusing to remove or delete—protected communications made in an <br/>
online forum that the developer moderates or controls. <br/>
•  Causing the removal or deletion of a protected communication from any publication (e.g., a <br/>

iv. Communications with Unqualified Protection  <br/>
 <br/>
We propose, and discuss below, a narrow class of communications—consisting of five <br/>
specific types of communications—that would receive unqualified protection from developer <br/>
prohibitions or restrictions. With respect to communications with unqualified protection, a <br/>
developer would be prohibited from imposing <i>any </i>prohibition or restriction. As discussed below, <br/>
we propose that this narrow class of communications warrants unqualified protection because of <br/>
the strength of the public policy interest being advanced by the communication and/or the <br/>

sensitivity with which the identified recipient treats, and implements safeguards to protect the <br/>
confidentiality and security of, the information received. A developer that imposes a prohibition <br/>
or restriction on a communication with unqualified protection would fail the first part of the two-<br/>
part test for allowable prohibitions or restrictions, and as such would contravene the Condition of <br/>
Certification. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<i>(A)</i> <i>Disclosures Required by Law</i> <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that where a communication relates to subject areas enumerated in <br/>
§ 170.403(a)(1) and there are federal, state, or local laws that would require the disclosure of <br/>
information related to health IT, developers must not prohibit or restrict in any way protected <br/>
communications made in compliance with those laws. We note that we expect that most health <br/>
IT contracts would allow for, or at the very least not prohibit or restrict, any communication or <br/>
disclosure that is required by law, such as responding to a court or Congressional subpoena, or a <br/>
valid warrant presented by law enforcement. We further propose that if required by law, a <br/>
potential communicator should not have to delay any protected communication under this <br/>
Condition of Certification. Furthermore, we propose that the reasonable limitations and <br/>
prohibitions that are discussed below and permitted by § 170.403(a)(2) do <i>not</i> apply to these <br/>
types of protected communications. <br/>

 <br/>
It is well established that there is a strong public interest in allowing open communication <br/>
of information regarding health care hazards, adverse events, and unsafe conditions. Given the <br/>
central role played by health IT in the delivery of care, information about health IT is a critical <br/>
component of any investigation into the cause of hazards, adverse events, or unsafe conditions. <br/>
On the basis of this public policy interest alone, we propose there is an overwhelming interest in <br/>
ensuring that all communications about health IT that are necessary to identify patient safety <br/>
risks, and to make health IT safer, not be encumbered by prohibitions or restrictions imposed by <br/>
health IT developers that may affect the extent or timeliness of communications.  In addition to <br/>
the public policy interest in promoting uninhibited communications about health IT safety, the <br/>
recognized communication channels for adverse events, hazards, and unsafe conditions provide <br/>
protections that help ensure that any disclosures made are appropriately handled and kept <br/>
confidential and secure. Indeed, the class of recipients to which the information can be <br/>
communicated under this category of communications with unqualified protection should <br/>
provide health IT developers with comfort that there is very little risk of such communications <br/>
prejudicing the developer’s intellectual property rights. For example, government agencies <br/>
impose appropriate controls on information they receive, mitigating any risk that developers may <br/>
feel arises from the disclosure of information about their health IT. Similarly, accrediting bodies <br/>
for health care delivery observe strict confidentiality policies for information received or <br/>
developed during the accreditation process and in connection with complaints received. <br/>
Finally, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (PSQIA)<a href="ONCs.html#187">79 </a>provides for <br/>
privilege and confidentiality protections for information that meets the definition of patient <br/>

PSQIA and its implementing regulations. We clarify that to the extent activities are conducted in <br/>
accordance with the PSQIA, its implementing regulation, and section 4005(c) of the Cures Act, <br/>
no such activities shall be construed as constituting restrictions or prohibitions that contravene <br/>
this Condition of Certification. <br/>
We understand that the nature of the information about health IT that would ordinarily be <br/>
disclosed by a health care provider when reporting an adverse event, hazard, or unsafe conditions <br/>
to government agencies, health care accreditation organizations, and patient safety organizations, <br/>
would not ordinarily contain intellectual property or trade secrets. Notwithstanding this, in light <br/>
of the public policy interest and established reporting mechanisms described above, we do not <br/>
consider the potential inclusion of intellectual property or trade secrets in the communication <br/>
should prohibit or restrict a health care provider from making a complete and timely report. For <br/>
example, proposed § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(D) permits developers to impose certain restrictions on <br/>
the general publication of screenshots, but we do not consider that such restrictions should be <br/>
permitted when the communication is made for one of the purposes, and to one of the recipients, <br/>
identified in § 170.403(a)(2)(i)(B). <br/>
 <br/>
We seek comment on whether the unqualified protection afforded to communications <br/>
made to a patient safety organizations about adverse events, hazards, and other unsafe conditions <br/>
should be limited. Specifically, we seek comment on whether the unqualified protection should <br/>
be limited by the nature of the patient safety organization to which a communication can be <br/>
made, or the nature of the communication that can made—such as limiting to only material that <br/>
was created as PSWP.  <br/>

<i>(C)</i> <i>Communicating Information About Cybersecurity Threats and </i><br/>
<i>Incidents to Government Agencies</i> <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that if health IT developers were to impose prohibitions or restrictions on the <br/>
ability of any person or entity to communicate information about<i> </i>cybersecurity threats and <br/>
incidents to government agencies, such conduct would not comply with this Condition of <br/>
Certification. Government agencies such as the United States Computer Emergency Readiness <br/>
Team (US-CERT) respond to and protect both the government and private industry from cyber <br/>
threats. Their work helps protect the entire health care system from cybersecurity threats and <br/>
relies on the timely reporting of security issues and vulnerabilities by health care providers and <br/>
health IT users. These agencies impose appropriate controls on information they receive, which <br/>
mitigates any risk that developers may feel arises from the disclosure of information about their <br/>
health IT. The US-CERT, for example, provides secure forms for such reporting, and we are <br/>
confident that reporting security incident information to US-CERT and other government <br/>
agencies would be unlikely to pose any threat to health IT developer intellectual property or <br/>
trade secrets. Additionally, the information likely reported regarding such an incident would <br/>
generally not reveal trade secrets. Where circumstances may require collection of more sensitive <br/>
and confidential information related to a developer’s intellectual property, we believe that <br/>
appropriate protections would likely apply and that the public benefit of thoroughly investigating <br/>
and addressing cybersecurity issues outweighs any potential harm. <br/>
 <br/>
Communications about security issues related to health IT may alert nefarious individuals <br/>
or entities to the existence of a security vulnerability which could be exploited before a <br/>
developer has time to fix the vulnerability. However, we propose that this concern must be <br/>

balanced against the imperative of ensuring that health IT customers are aware of security <br/>
vulnerabilities so that they can respond by deploying reactive measures independent of the <br/>
developer, such as ceasing health information exchange with a compromised system. We seek <br/>
comment on whether it would be reasonable to permit health IT developers to impose limited <br/>
restrictions on communications about security issues so as to safeguard the confidentiality, <br/>
integrity, and security of eHI. For example, should health IT developers be permitted to require <br/>
that health IT users notify the developer about the existence of a security vulnerability prior to, <br/>
or simultaneously with, any communication about the issue to a government agency?<b> </b><br/>
<i>(D)</i><b> </b><i>Communicating Information About Information Blocking and </i><br/>
<i>Other Unlawful Practices to a Government Agency</i><b> </b><br/>
 <br/>
As in the circumstances described above, we believe that the public benefit associated <br/>
with the communication of information to government agencies on information blocking, or any <br/>
other unlawful practice, outweighs any concerns developers might have about the disclosure of <br/>
information about their health IT. We believe that reporting information blocking, as well as <br/>
other unlawful practices, to a government agency would not cause an undue threat to a health IT <br/>
developer’s intellectual property or trade secrets. Generally speaking, agencies collecting reports <br/>
would protect all information received and keep it confidential to the extent permitted by law. <br/>

other Program requirement (45 CFR part 170) justify prohibiting developers of health IT from <br/>
placing any restrictions on such protected communications. Information regarding the failure of a <br/>
health IT product to meet any Condition of Certification or other Program requirement is vital to <br/>
the effective performance and integrity of the Program, which certifies that health IT functions <br/>
consistent with its certification. While the current procedures for reporting issues with certified <br/>
health IT encourage providers to contact developers in the first instance to address certification <br/>
issues, users of health IT should not hesitate to contact ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies <br/>
(ONC-ACBs), or ONC itself, if the developer does not provide an appropriate response, or the <br/>
matter is of a nature that should be immediately reported to an ONC-ACB or to ONC.<b> </b><br/>
v. Permitted Prohibitions and Restrictions<i> </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose that, <i>except for communications with unqualified protection discussed above </i><br/>
<i>and enumerated in § 170.403(a)(2)(i)</i>, health IT developers would be permitted to impose certain <br/>
narrow kinds of prohibitions and restrictions discussed below and specified in § <br/>
170.403(a)(2)(ii). We believe this policy strikes a reasonable balance between the need to <br/>
promote open communication about health IT and related business practices and the need to <br/>
protect the legitimate interests of health IT developers and other entities. Specifically, with the <br/>
exception of communications with unqualified protection, developers would be permitted to <br/>
prohibit or restrict the following communications, subject to certain conditions:  <br/>
•  Communications of their own employees;  <br/>
•  Disclosure of non-user-facing aspects of the software;  <br/>
•  Certain communications that would infringe the developer’s or another person’s intellectual <br/>
property rights;  <br/>

•  Publication of screenshots in very narrow circumstances; and <br/>
•  Communications of information that a person or entity knows only because of their <br/>
participation in developer-led product development and testing. <br/>
 <br/>
As discussed in detail in the sections that follow, the proposed Condition of Certification <br/>
carefully delineates the circumstances under which these types of prohibitions and restrictions <br/>
would be permitted, including certain associated conditions that developers would be required to <br/>
meet. To be clear, any prohibition or restriction not expressly permitted would violate the <br/>
Condition. Additionally, it would be the developer’s burden to demonstrate to the satisfaction of <br/>
ONC that the developer has met all associated requirements. Further, as an additional safeguard, <br/>
we propose that where a developer seeks to avail itself of one of the permitted types of <br/>
prohibitions or restrictions, the developer must ensure that potential communicators are clearly <br/>
and explicitly notified about the information and material that can be communicated, and that <br/>
which cannot. We propose this would mean that the language of health IT contracts must be <br/>
precise and specific. Contractual provisions or public statements that support a permitted <br/>
prohibition or restriction on communication should be very specific about the rights and <br/>
obligations of the potential communicator. Contract terms that are vague and cannot be readily <br/>
understood by a reasonable health IT customer will not benefit from the qualifications to this <br/>
Condition of Certification outlined below. <b> </b><br/>

individuals who are contracted by health IT developers to deliver products and/or services (such <br/>
as consultants), may be exposed to highly sensitive, proprietary, and valuable information in the <br/>

course of performing their duties. We also recognize that the proper functioning of a workforce <br/>
depends, at least in part, on the ability of an employer to regulate how and when the organization <br/>
communicates information to the public, and that employees owe confidentiality obligations to <br/>
their employers. We propose that on this basis, developers are permitted to impose prohibitions <br/>
or restrictions on the communications of employees and contractors to the extent that those <br/>
communications fall outside of the class of communications with unqualified protection as <br/>
discussed above. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<i>(B) Non-user-facing aspects of health IT</i> <br/>
 <br/>
The purpose of this Condition of Certification is to ensure that health IT users and other <br/>
potential communicators are not restrained in their ability to communicate—publicly or <br/>
privately—about certain protected subject areas. We propose that this purpose can generally be <br/>
achieved without communicators disclosing information about those parts of health IT that are <br/>
legally protected trade secrets. As such, we propose this Condition of Certification will permit <br/>
health IT developers to impose prohibitions and restrictions on communications that are not <br/>
communications with unqualified protection to the extent necessary to ensure that <br/>
communications do not disclose “non-user-facing aspects of health IT.” <br/>
 <br/>
A “non-user-facing aspect of health IT” is, for the purpose of this Condition of <br/>
Certification, an aspect of health IT that is not a “user-facing aspect of health IT.” A “user-facing <br/>
aspect of health IT” means those aspects of health IT that that are disclosed and evident to <br/>
anyone running, using, or observing the operation of health IT. That is, a user-facing aspect of <br/>
health IT comprises those aspects of the health IT that are manifest in how the health IT software <br/>
works. User-facing aspects of health IT include the design concepts and functionality that is <br/>

readily ascertainable from the health IT’s user interface and screen display. They do not include <br/>
those parts of the health IT that are not exposed to persons running, using, or observing the <br/>
operation of the health IT. We propose that non-user-facing aspects of health IT would include <br/>
source and object code, software documentation, design specifications, flowcharts, and file and <br/>
data formats. We welcome comments on whether these and other aspects of health IT should be <br/>
treated as not being user-facing. <br/>
For clarity, we note that the terminology of “user-facing aspects of health IT” is not <br/>
intended to afford only health IT users with specific protections against developer prohibitions or <br/>
restrictions on communications. Rather, the terminology is agnostic as to the identity of the <br/>
communicator and is instead focused on describing those aspects of health IT that are readily <br/>
ascertainable from the health IT’s user interface and screen display. Numerous other potential <br/>
communicators will also be exposed to “user-facing aspects of health IT,” such as third-party <br/>
contractors, health information exchange organizations, recipients of a software demonstration, <br/>
and trade groups or researchers that observe the operation of health IT in the field. <br/>
We propose that this approach reasonably implements the Cures Act, which, in direct <br/>
response to strict confidentiality obligations, broad intellectual property clauses, and non-<br/>
disclosure provisions in EHR contracts, identified a list of protected subject areas for disclosure <br/>
(enumerated at section 3001(c)(5)(D)(iii) of the PHSA) that largely targeted the aspects of health <br/>
IT that are apparent to, and known by, individuals and entities that use or interact with health IT. <br/>
We propose that if a health IT user were prohibited from describing the user-facing aspects of <br/>
their health IT product, they could not sensibly communicate useful information about the <br/>
usability or interoperability of the product, or their experiences as a health IT user. These subject <br/>

 <br/>
areas are fundamentally tied to the way that the health IT product works, its design, and its <br/>
functionality. <br/>
 <br/>
Protecting the communication of “user-facing aspects of health IT” is also consistent with <br/>
the treatment of software products under trade secret law, where the public-facing aspects of <br/>
software products are not generally considered secret because they are evident to anyone running <br/>
the software program. Moreover, this approach is appropriate given the manner in which health <br/>
IT is deployed and used by health IT customers. Unlike software products that are deployed and <br/>
used in a cloistered setting where access to the software is highly restricted, health IT is typically <br/>
deployed in a setting in which the operation of the health IT can be readily observed by a wide <br/>
range of persons. Health IT used in a physician’s consulting room can be observed by the patient. <br/>
Health IT deployed in a hospital can be observed by numerous individuals in addition to those <br/>
who are “authorized users” of the health IT system, including, for example, the patient, the <br/>
patient’s family, volunteer staff, law enforcement, and clergy. As such, because health IT is of a <br/>
nature that license terms or nondisclosure obligations do not act as a genuine control over the <br/>
disclosure of those aspects of the software that are “user-facing,” communications about such <br/>
aspects should be afforded protection from developer prohibitions and restrictions under this <br/>
proposed Condition of Certification. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<i>(C) Intellectual Property </i> <br/>
 <br/>
Many aspects of health IT—including software and documentation—will contain <br/>
intellectual property that belongs to the health IT developer (or a third party) and is protected by <br/>
law. Health IT products may have portions in which copyrighted works exist, or that are subject <br/>
to patent protection. As in other technology sectors, health IT developers place a high value on <br/>

 <br/>
their intellectual property and go to significant lengths to protect it, including intellectual <br/>
property provisions in their health IT contracts. <br/>
 <br/>
This Condition of Certification is not intended to operate as a <i>de facto</i> license for health <br/>
IT users and others to act in any way that might infringe the legitimate intellectual property <br/>
rights of developers. Indeed, we propose that health IT developers are permitted to prohibit or <br/>
restrict communications that would infringe their intellectual property rights so long as the <br/>
communication in question is not a communication with unqualified protection. However, any <br/>
prohibition and restriction imposed by a developer must be no broader than legally permissible <br/>
and reasonably necessary to protect the developer’s legitimate intellectual property interests. We <br/>
are aware that some health IT contracts contain broad intellectual property provisions (and <br/>
related terms, such as nondisclosure provisions) that purport to prevent health IT customers and <br/>
users from using copyright material in ways that are lawful. On this basis, while we are <br/>
providing an exception for the protection of intellectual property interests, we want to clarify that <br/>
under this Condition of Certification health IT developers are not permitted to prohibit or restrict, <br/>
or purport to prohibit or restrict, communications that would be a “fair use” of any copyright <br/>
work comprised in the developer’s health IT. That is, a developer is not permitted to prohibit or <br/>
restrict communications under the guise of copyright protection (or under the guise of a <br/>
confidentiality or non-disclosure obligation) when the communication in question makes a use of <br/>
the copyright material in a way that would qualify that use as a “fair use.”<a href="ONCs.html#196">80</a>  <br/>

of health IT. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<i>(D)</i> <i>Faithful Reproductions of Health IT Screenshots</i> <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that health IT developers generally would not be permitted to prohibit or <br/>
restrict communications that disclose screenshots of the developer’s health IT. We consider <br/>
screen displays an essential component of health IT performance and usability, and their <br/>
reproduction may be necessary in order for a health IT user or other health IT stakeholder to <br/>
properly make communications about the subject matters enumerated in § 170.403(a)(1). We <br/>
acknowledge that some health IT developers have historically and aggressively sought to <br/>
prohibit the disclosure of such communications. We consider that developers may benefit from <br/>
screen displays being faithfully reproduced so that health IT users and other stakeholders can <br/>
form an objective opinion on any question raised about usability in communications protected by <br/>
this proposed Condition of Certification. Moreover, we consider that the reproduction of <br/>
screenshots in connection with the making of a communication protected by this Condition of <br/>
Certification would ordinarily represent a “fair use” of any copyright subsisting in the screen <br/>
display, and developers should not impose prohibitions or restrictions that would limit that fair <br/>
use. <br/>
Notwithstanding the above, we propose to permit certain prohibitions and restrictions on <br/>
the communication of screenshots. Except in connection with communications with unqualified <br/>
protection, developers would be permitted to impose certain restrictions on the disclosure of <br/>
screenshots, as described below. <br/>

 <br/>
In order to ensure that disclosures of screenshots are reasonable and represent a faithful <br/>
reproduction of the developer’s screen design and health IT, we propose that developers would <br/>
be permitted to prevent communicators from altering screenshots, other than to annotate the <br/>
screenshot or to resize it for the purpose of publication. We consider this a reasonable limitation <br/>
on the disclosure of screenshots and one that would help developers’ health IT avoid being <br/>
misrepresented by communicators seeking to make a communication protected by this proposed <br/>
Condition of Certification. <br/>
 <br/>
We also propose that health IT developers could impose restrictions on the disclosure of a <br/>
screenshot on the basis that it would infringe third-party intellectual property rights (on their <br/>
behalf or as required by license). However, to take advantage of this exception, the developer <br/>
would need to first put all potential communicators on sufficient written notice of those parts of <br/>
the screen display that contain trade secrets or intellectual property rights and cannot be <br/>
communicated, and would still need to allow communicators to communicate redacted versions <br/>
of screenshots that do not reproduce those parts.  <br/>
Finally, we also recognize that health IT developers may have obligations under HIPAA <br/>
as a business associate and that it would be reasonable for developers to impose restrictions on <br/>
the communication of screenshots that contain protected health information, provided that <br/>
developers permit the communication of screenshots that have been redacted to conceal <br/>
protected health information, or the relevant individual’s consent or authorization had been <br/>
obtained. <br/>

 <br/>
We are aware that some health IT developers expose aspects of their health IT to health <br/>
care providers and others for the purpose of testing and development prior to a product’s <br/>
“general availability” release. Such disclosures may relate to beta releases that are shared with <br/>
certain customers for testing prior to the software being made generally available to the market, <br/>
or may be made as part of a joint-venture or cooperative development process. In these <br/>
circumstances, we propose that a health IT developer would be justified in keeping information <br/>
about its health IT confidential, and we do not intend that the protection afforded to <br/>
communicators under this Condition of Certification would allow disclosures of this information. <br/>
This permitted prohibition or restriction would allow developers to seek appropriate intellectual <br/>
property protection and freely discuss novel, “unreleased” product features with their customer <br/>
base, which has significant public policy benefits for research and innovation in the health IT <br/>
industry. <br/>
 <br/>
As with the other allowable restrictions listed above, we propose that this permitted <br/>
restriction would be limited and does not apply to communications which are communications <br/>
with unqualified protection as described above and specified in § 170.403(a)(2)(i). For example, <br/>
information that is learned as part of development and testing, such as the hard-coding of test <br/>
procedure processes that raise serious patient safety concerns, could be communicated for one of <br/>
the limited purposes specified in § 170.403(a)(2)(i) if the software is certified or released to <br/>
market. We propose that this permitted restriction would also not apply to communications about <br/>
the released version of the health IT once the health IT has been released to market or has been <br/>
certified, provided that the communications otherwise meet all other requirements to be afforded <br/>

 <br/>
protection under this Condition of Certification and the information communicated could be <br/>
discovered by any ordinary user of the health IT.  <br/>
 <br/>
For example, a health IT developer and a large health system enter into an agreement for <br/>
members of the health IT developer’s engineering team to work with members of the health <br/>
system’s clinical team to develop a customization for the system’s use of the developer’s EHR. <br/>
In order to properly protect any intellectual property rights, or proprietary information, arising <br/>
from this work, the developer and health system enter into a contract which imposes on the <br/>
system and affected members of its clinical team strict nondisclosure related to testing and <br/>
development of the health IT. This would be reasonable and would not contravene this Condition <br/>
of Certification, provided that:  1) the nondisclosure obligations were narrowly targeted toward <br/>
the work product associated with the testing and development; and 2) the obligations ceased <br/>
immediately upon any resultant software being deployed in the health system, to the extent that <br/>
the information fell within one of the subject areas enumerated in § 170.403(a)(1) and would be <br/>
apparent to an ordinary user of the health IT. ￼ <br/>
 <br/>
To ensure that this permitted prohibition/restriction is not abused, such as by maintaining <br/>
a product in beta release for an indefinite or lengthy period of time, we request comment on <br/>
whether we should limit the time this protection would apply for testing purposes. This could be <br/>
no longer than a year after release of a product or update. We also request comment on whether <br/>
we should set specific parameters for covered testing. For example, we note above our <br/>
expectations that a product would be shared with <i>certain</i> customers for testing prior to the <br/>
software being made <i>generally available</i> to the market. As such, for this permitted <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
c. Maintenance of Certification Requirements <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that to maintain compliance with this Condition of Certification a health IT <br/>
developer must not establish or enforce any contract or agreement provision that contravenes this <br/>
Condition of Certification. We are aware that some developers currently have in place health IT <br/>
contracts that contain provisions that contravene this proposed Condition of Certification <br/>
because they impose impermissible prohibitions or restrictions on communications. In some <br/>
instances, the provisions in question will be expressly at odds with this Condition, imposing <br/>
obligations on health IT customers, or creating rights in favor of the developer, that prohibit or <br/>
restrict communications that are protected. In other instances, a contract will include a provision <br/>
that contravenes this Condition because it has been drawn in such broad terms—such as an <br/>
overly-expansive definition of confidential information—that a reasonable reader of the <br/>
provision would consider the making of a communication protected by this Condition a breach of <br/>
the contract. <br/>
 <br/>
Health IT contracts are typically for a significant duration—e.g., 5 years or more—or <br/>
include an automatic renewal whereby the then current terms roll over for any renewal period. <br/>
The implementation of this proposed Condition of Certification cannot therefore wait until health <br/>
IT contracts that contravene this Condition expire in the ordinary course. As such, we are <br/>
requiring that health IT developers take immediate steps to become in compliance with this <br/>
Condition of Certification. <br/>

 <br/>
We propose that a health IT developer must notify all customers and those with which it <br/>
has contracts/agreements, within six months of the effective date of a subsequent final rule for <br/>
this proposed rule, that any communication or contract/agreement provision that contravenes this <br/>
Condition of Certification will not be enforced by the health IT developer. Further, we propose <br/>
that this notice would need to be provided annually up to and until the health IT developer <br/>
amends the contract or agreement to remove or make void any contractual provision that <br/>
contravenes this Condition of Certification. We further propose as a Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirement in § 170.405(b)(2) that health IT developers must amend their contracts or <br/>
agreements to remove or make void any provisions that contravene the Condition of Certification <br/>
within a reasonable period of time, but not later than two years from the effective date of a <br/>
subsequent final rule for this proposed rule.   <br/>
We believe this is an appropriate approach as we understand that health IT developers are <br/>
in regular contact with their customers, and so the provision of a notice that satisfies this <br/>
requirement should not present an undue burden for a developer. We would also expect that <br/>
developers have kept good records of nondisclosure agreements that they have entered into with <br/>
other organizations or individuals, such as third-party developers, and can communicate with <br/>
those organizations or individuals as necessary to satisfy this requirement. In the event that a <br/>
health IT developer cannot, despite all reasonable efforts, locate an entity or individual that <br/>
previously entered into an agreement with the developer that prohibits or restricts <br/>
communications protected by this Condition, the developer would not be in contravention of this <br/>
Condition so long as it takes no step to enforce the prohibition or restriction. For clarity, we do <br/>
not propose that health IT developers be required to furnish to ONC or their ONC-ACB copies of <br/>

notices made to customers, or copies of contracts or agreements revised, in satisfaction of this <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirement, although those communications may be requested by <br/>
ONC or an ONC-ACB in the usual course of business. To this point, under the “Enforcement” <br/>
section of this proposed rule (VII.D), we describe our general enforcement approach outlining a <br/>
corrective action process for ONC to review instances where Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification requirements are not being met by a health IT developer under the Program.   <br/>
 <br/>
We note that another approach we considered proposing would have been to require that <br/>
developers amend their current health IT contracts immediately. We have, however, relied on the <br/>
proposed requirement that developers not enforce contractual terms that contravene this <br/>
proposed Condition of Certification until they can amend their contracts in a reasonable period of <br/>
time, but not later than two years from the effective date of a subsequent final rule for this <br/>
proposed rule. We seek comment on whether this is an adequate approach to removing <br/>
prohibitions and restrictions on protected communications and ensuring that health IT customers, <br/>
users, researchers, and other stakeholders are aware of their right to engage in such <br/>
communications notwithstanding existing contracts or agreements to the contrary. <br/>
4. Application Programming Interfaces <br/>
As a Condition of Certification (and Maintenance thereof) under the Program, the<b> </b>Cures <br/>
Act requires health IT developers to publish APIs that allow “health information from such <br/>
technology to be accessed, exchanged, and used without special effort through the use of APIs or <br/>
successor technology or standards, as provided for under applicable law.” The Cures Act’s API <br/>
Condition of Certification also states that a developer must, through an API, “provide access to <br/>

 <br/>
all data elements of a patient’s electronic health record to the extent permissible under applicable <br/>
privacy laws.” <br/>
 <br/>
The Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification includes several key phrases and <br/>
requirements for health IT developers that go beyond just the technical functionality of the <br/>
products they present for certification. In this section of the preamble we outline our proposals to <br/>
implement the Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification in order to provide compliance clarity <br/>
for health IT developers.  <br/>
These proposals include new standards, new implementation specifications, and a new <br/>
certification criterion as well as detailed Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirements. We also propose to modify the Base EHR definition. We note that health IT <br/>
developers should also consider these proposals in the context of what could warrant review <br/>
from an information blocking perspective in so far as action (or inaction) that would be <br/>
inconsistent with this proposed rule’s API Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirements. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
a. Statutory Interpretation and API Policy Principles <br/>
 <br/>
One of the most significant phrases in the Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification <br/>
concerns the deployment and use of APIs “without special effort.” Specifically, the Cures Act <br/>
requires health IT developers to publish APIs and allow health information from such technology <br/>
“to be accessed, exchanged, and used without special effort.” In this context, we interpret the <br/>
“effort” exerted (i.e., by whom) to be focused on the API users, which could include third-party <br/>
software developers, the health care providers that acquired this API technology, and patients, <br/>
health care providers, and payers that use apps/services that connect to API technology.  <br/>

 <br/>
As we considered the meaning and context associated with the phrase “without special <br/>
effort” and what would make APIs included in certified health IT truly “open,” we focused on <br/>
key attributes that could be used to refine our interpretation and guide our proposals. We <br/>
interpret “without special effort” to require that APIs, and the health care ecosystem in which <br/>
they are deployed, have three attributes: <i>standardized</i>, <i>transparent</i>, and <i>pro-competitive</i>. Each of <br/>
these attributes is briefly described in more detail below and all of our subsequent proposals <br/>
address one or a combination of these attributes. <br/>
•  <i>Standardized</i> – meaning that all health IT developers seeking certification would have to <br/>
implement the same technical API capabilities in their products (using modern, computing <br/>
standards such as RESTful interfaces and XML/JSON). Technical consistency and <br/>
implementation predictability are fundamental to scale API-enabled interoperability and <br/>
reduce the level of custom development and costs necessary to access, exchange, and use <br/>
health information. Further, from a regulatory standpoint, health IT developers would gain <br/>
certainty in regards to pre-certification testing requirements and post-certification “real world <br/>
testing” expectations. Equally, from an industry standpoint, a consistent and predictable set <br/>
of API functions would provide the health IT ecosystem with known technical requirements <br/>
against which “app” developers and other innovative services can be built.  <br/>
•  <i>Transparent</i> – meaning that all health IT developers seeking certification would need to <br/>
make the specific business and technical documentation necessary to interact with the APIs <br/>
in production freely and publicly accessible. Such transparency and openness is <br/>
commonplace in many other industries and has fueled innovation, growth, and competition.  <br/>

 <br/>
•  <i>Pro-competitive</i> – meaning that all health IT developers seeking certification would need to <br/>
abide by business practices that promote the efficient access, exchange, and use of EHI to <br/>
support a competitive marketplace that enhances consumer value and choice. Moreover, <br/>
health care providers should have the sole authority and autonomy to unilaterally permit <br/>
third-party software developers<i> </i>to connect to the API technology they have acquired. In other <br/>
words, health IT developers <b>must not</b> interfere with a health care provider’s use of their <br/>
acquired API technology in any way, especially ways that would impact its equitable access <br/>
and use based on (for example) another software developer’s size, current client base, or <br/>
business line. It also means that developers (together with health care providers that deploy <br/>
APIs) are accountable to patients who, as consumers of health care services, have paid for <br/>
their care and the information generated from such care. Thus, patients should be able to <br/>
access their EHI via any API-enabled app they choose without special effort, including <br/>
without incurring additional costs and without encountering access requirements that impede <br/>
their ability to access their information in a persistent manner. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
b. Key Terms   <br/>
To clearly convey the stakeholders on which our proposals focus and are meant to <br/>
support, we propose to use the following terms to reflect these meanings and/or roles: <br/>
•  The term “<i>API technology</i>” (with a lowercase “t”) generally refers to the capabilities of <br/>
certified health IT that fulfill the API-focused certification criteria adopted or proposed for <br/>
adoption at 45 CFR 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(11). <br/>
•  “<i>API Technology Supplier</i>” refers to a health IT developer that creates the API technology <br/>
that is presented for testing and certification to any of the certification criteria adopted or <br/>

 <br/>
proposed for adoption at 45 CFR 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(11). We propose to adopt this <br/>
term in § 170.102. <br/>
•  “<i>API Data Provider</i>” refers to the organization that deploys the API technology created by <br/>
the “API Technology Supplier” and provides access via the API technology to data it <br/>
produces and electronically manages. In some cases, the API Data Provider may contract <br/>
with the API Technology Supplier to perform the API deployment service on its behalf. <br/>
However, in such circumstances, the API Data Provider retains control of what and how <br/>
information is disclosed and so for the purposes of this definition is considered to be the <br/>
entity that deploys the API technology. We propose to adopt this term in § 170.102. <br/>
•  “<i>API User</i>” – refers to persons and entities that use or create software applications that <br/>
interact with the APIs developed by the “API Technology Supplier” and deployed by the <br/>
“API Data Provider.” An API User includes, but is not limited to, third-party software <br/>
developers, developers of software applications used by API Data Providers, patients, health <br/>
care providers, and payers that use apps/services that connect to API technology. We propose <br/>
to adopt this term in § 170.102. <br/>
We also use: <br/>
•  The term “<i>(g)(10)-certified API</i>” for ease of reference throughout the preamble to refer to <br/>
health IT certified to the certification criterion proposed for adoption in 45 CFR <br/>
170.315(g)(10). <br/>
•  The term “<i>app</i>” for ease of reference to describe any type of software application that would <br/>
be designed to interact with the (g)(10)-certified APIs. This generic term is meant to <br/>

c. Proposed API Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification <br/>
Criterion <br/>
APIs can be thought of as a set of commands, functions, protocols, and/or tools published <br/>
by one software developer (“software developer A”) that enable other software developers (X, Y, <br/>
and Z) to create programs and applications that interact with A’s software without needing to <br/>
know the “internal” workings of A’s software. APIs can facilitate more seamless access to health <br/>
information and it is important to note for context that ONC adopted three 2015 Edition <br/>
certification criteria that specified API capabilities for Health IT Modules (criteria adopted in 45 <br/>
CFR 170.315(g)(7), (g)(8), and (g)(9)). The following sections detail our proposals to adopt <br/>
standards, implementation specifications, and a new API certification criterion. Together, these <br/>
proposals account for the technical requirements we propose to associate with the Cures Act’s <br/>
API Condition of Certification and are reinforced through the condition’s policy proposals.  <br/>

i. Proposed Adoption of FHIR DSTU2 Standard <br/>
 <br/>
Overall, and on balance, we have structured our standards and implementation <br/>
specifications proposals to best meet the health IT industry where it is most prepared to comply <br/>
today. As a result, we propose to adopt the HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources <br/>
(FHIR®) standard as a foundational standard within our suite of proposals. Specifically, we <br/>
propose to adopt FHIR Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU) 2 (hereafter referred to as “FHIR <br/>
Release 2”) as a baseline standard conformance requirement. In so doing, we can work with <br/>
industry to support a conformance testing infrastructure for a full suite of proposals focused on <br/>

one FHIR release (its associated implementation specifications) and complementary security and <br/>
app registration protocols, compared to numerous versions.<a href="ONCs.html#209">81 </a> <br/>
The 2015 Edition final rule did not include specific standards or implementation <br/>
specifications to describe the way in which APIs needed to be designed to meet § 170.315(g)(8). <br/>
Instead, we specified a functional certification criterion and encouraged the industry to coalesce <br/>
around a standardized specification for its API functionality, such as the FHIR standard. We did, <br/>
however, require health IT developers to make their technical API documentation publicly <br/>
available and we subsequently made such information accessible via the CHPL.  <br/>
Upon reviewing health IT developers certified to § 170.315(g)(8), approximately 32% <br/>
have published via the CHPL that they are using FHIR, specifically FHIR Release 2, as of mid-<br/>
September 2018. Additionally, nearly 51% of health IT developers appear to be using a version <br/>
of FHIR and OAuth 2.0 together. We also note that when viewed from the perspective of how <br/>
many providers are served by these FHIR implementers, we estimate that approximate 87% of <br/>
hospitals and 57% of clinicians are served by developers with a FHIR Release 2 API and 87% of <br/>
hospitals and 69% of clinicians are served by developers with a FHIR API of any version. In the <br/>
years since the 2015 Edition final rule, industry stakeholders have made rapid progress to <br/>
advance the FHIR standard. This includes substantial investments in industry pilots, specification <br/>
development led through the Argonaut Project<a href="ONCs.html#209">82</a> production deployment of APIs conformant to <br/>
FHIR Release 2 following the Argonaut specifications, and the support for FHIR Release 2 in <br/>
Apple’s iOS 11.3, which includes a new “health records” app for the iPhone based on these <br/>
                                                 <br/>

 <br/>
specifications.<a href="ONCs.html#210">83</a> Therefore, the industry is well prepared and ready to adopt the FHIR standard. <br/>
Thus, we propose to adopt FHIR Release 2 as the baseline standard in a new API standards <br/>
section of our rules at 45 CFR 170.215(a)(1). Additionally, as discussed in further detail below, <br/>
we reference FHIR Release 2 for use in the new API certification criterion proposed for adoption <br/>
in § 170.315(g)(10).  <br/>
 <br/>
Although FHIR Release 3 is published and some health IT developers have included <br/>
varied support for it in their product(s) at this time, there is limited evidence that its production <br/>
deployment is as widespread as FHIR Release 2. Thus, we believe that FHIR Release 2 is the <br/>
most appropriate version to propose to adopt as part of proposed § 170.315(g)(10)’s <br/>
conformance requirements. This approach would provide a stable and consistent direction in <br/>
which the industry can go when it comes to deploying (g)(10)-certified APIs that support data <br/>
access to the USCDI. FHIR Release 2 best reflects the industry’s current maturity and <br/>
implementation readiness, it has been more rigorously tested, and it is largely implemented in <br/>
most 2015 Edition health IT systems that have and are being deployed in production. Thus, the <br/>
incremental burden for many health IT developers to get certified to the proposed criterion in § <br/>
170.315(g)(10) would be largely limited to the added security and registration conformance <br/>
requirements we have proposed to include. We recognize, however, that some health IT <br/>
developers certified to § 170.315(g)(8) chose not to use FHIR and will have more substantial <br/>
changes to make in order to meet this proposal. <br/>

Additionally, FHIR Release 4 has now been published<a href="ONCs.html#211">84</a> and updated associated <br/>
implementation specifications are expected to follow. FHIR Release 4 has several key <br/>
improvements, including certain foundational aspects in the standard and “FHIR resources” <br/>
designated as “normative” for the first time. This will lead to acycle of more mature US FHIR <br/>
Core profiles aligned with Release 4 and additional implementation guidance that explicitly <br/>
specifies how to handle populations of patient data (batch exports) via FHIR to more efficiently <br/>
enable population and learning health system-oriented services. Likewise, from an industry <br/>
update trajectory, we believe that FHIR Release 4’s normative resources will be compelling from <br/>
a maturity and stability perspective such that many health IT developers will either rapidly <br/>
progress to FHIR Release 4 from Release 3 or skip wide-scale production deployment of FHIR <br/>
Release 3 altogether, making FHIR Release 4 the next de facto version the industry would move <br/>
toward and coalesce behind.  <br/>
Given FHIR Release 4’s public release and that the industry will begin to implement <br/>
Release 4 in parallel with this rulemaking, we request comment on the following options we <br/>
could pursue for a final rule. <br/>
<i>Option 1 (proposed in regulation text)</i>: Adopt just FHIR Release 2 for reference in <br/>
proposed § 170.315(g)(10). This option would require health IT developers seeking certification <br/>
to build, test, and certify systems solely to FHIR Release 2 and its associated implementation <br/>
specifications. Under this option, if the National Coordinator approved the use of FHIR Release <br/>
3 or 4 (pursuant to the Standards Version Advancement Process) it would occur, at the earliest, <br/>
one year after a final rule was issued. Given that timing, and the compliance deadlines proposed <br/>

later in this section, it would mean that health IT developers would have no option but to develop <br/>
to FHIR Release 2 in order to meet the proposed compliance deadlines. <br/>
<i>Option 2:</i> Adopt FHIR Release 2 and FHIR Release 3 in order to introduce optionality <br/>
into how health IT developers are able to demonstrate compliance with proposed § <br/>
170.315(g)(10). In other words, by adopting and referencing both FHIR Release 2 and 3 in <br/>
proposed § 170.315(g)(10) it would permit a health IT developer to use either one to meet the <br/>
criterion (i.e., both versions would not be required to be supported and demonstrating only one <br/>
would be needed to meet certification). Similarly, under this option, if the National Coordinator <br/>
approved the use of FHIR Release 4 (pursuant to the Standards Version Advancement Process) it <br/>
would occur, at the earliest, one year after a final rule was issued. Given that timing, and the <br/>
compliance deadlines proposed later in this section, it would mean that health IT developers <br/>
would have no option but to develop to FHIR Release 2 or Release 3 in order to meet the <br/>
proposed compliance deadlines. <br/>
<i>Option 3:</i> Adopt FHIR Release 2 and FHIR Release 4 in order to introduce flexibility <br/>
into how health IT developers are able to demonstrate compliance with proposed § <br/>
170.315(g)(10). The full implementation of this option would depend on all applicable <br/>
corresponding FHIR Release 2 implementation specifications also being published in their FHIR <br/>
Release 4 formats and available prior to the issuance of a final rule. Provided these FHIR <br/>
Release 4 implementation specifications are published in time for a final rule, this option would <br/>
appear to be the best near- and long-term option for the industry. We anticipate this being the <br/>
case because it would let lagging health IT developers catch up to the FHIR Release 2 baseline <br/>
while at the same time enable leading health IT developers to move directly and immediately to <br/>

FHIR Release 4 as a means to meet proposed § 170.315(g)(10)’s compliance timelines. In other <br/>
words, unlike Options 1 and 2, the Standards Version Advancement Process would not be <br/>
necessary and the trajectory of leading health IT developers would be well supported by the <br/>
certification criterion.  We also request comment on a variant of Option 3 that would include a <br/>
pre-defined cut-over for the permitted use of and certification to FHIR Release 2. We note that if <br/>
this variant were implemented as part of Option 3, we would likely also need to add a <br/>
maintenance of certification requirement in the final rule to establish an upgrade timeline to <br/>
FHIR Release 4 for those health IT developers who originally sought certification for FHIR <br/>
Release 2. Such a maintenance requirement would seem necessary in order to bring the industry <br/>
into closer alignment with respect to a more up-to-date national baseline for FHIR. <br/>
<i>Option 4:</i> Adopt solely FHIR Release 4 in the final rule for reference in proposed § <br/>
170.315(g)(10). This option would require health IT developers seeking certification to build, <br/>
test, and certify systems solely to FHIR Release 4 and its associated implementation <br/>
specifications. Again, provided all applicable FHIR Release 4 implementation specifications are <br/>
published in time for a final rule, this option would appear to be a close preference to Option 3 <br/>
for industry. We believe this would be the case because by the time a final rule associated with <br/>
these proposals is issued, it is likely that health IT developers would have close to or over a <br/>
year’s worth of development experience with FHIR Release 4. As a result, many may be poised <br/>
to introduce their first round of generally available FHIR Release 4 products into production. If <br/>
ONC were to offer certification to FHIR Release 2 (as in Option 3) this flexibility could <br/>
unintentionally delay the industry’s transition to FHIR Release 4 and slow progress associated <br/>
with FHIR-based interoperability. The following compliance timeline example attempts to make <br/>

this point clearer. If, for example, the final rule was effective January 2020, based on other <br/>
proposals associated with the API Conditions of Certification, health IT developers would have <br/>
up to 2 years to rollout their (g)(10)-certified API technology, which would mean January 2022. <br/>
At that point, FHIR Release 4 would have been published for nearly 3 years and FHIR Release 2 <br/>
would have been published for nearly 6 years. Without a pre-defined cut-over for FHIR Release <br/>
2 in Option 3, that certification approach would permit FHIR Release 2 APIs to be deployed in <br/>
2022 and used for an indeterminate period of time. <br/>
In preparing your comments, please fully review our proposed certification criterion in § <br/>
170.315(g)(10) and the accompanying Conditions of Certification attributed to the API-oriented <br/>
certification criteria. Notably, if we were to adopt another FHIR Release in a final rule as an <br/>
alternative to FHIR Release 2 for the proposed API criterion in § 170.315(g)(10), then we would <br/>
also adopt the applicable implementation specifications and FHIR profiles (the US FHIR Core <br/>
profiles) associated with the FHIR Release in order to support USCDI data access. We highly <br/>
encourage stakeholders to express their perspective and explicitly note their preferred option in <br/>
comments.  <br/>
ii. Proposed Adoption of Associated FHIR Release 2 Implementation <br/>
Specifications  <br/>
Our proposal to adopt the FHIR standard alone, however, is insufficient to provide the <br/>
level of consistent implementation that will be necessary to realize the “without special effort” <br/>
provision in this Condition of Certification. FHIR, much like other standards that are initially <br/>
developed to be internationally applicable, requires additional implementation specifications in <br/>
order to further constrain implementation choices and reflect US-based standards policies (such <br/>

 <br/>
as the use of RxNorm for representing medications). In FHIR, the additional constraints placed <br/>
on “base FHIR resources” are expressed through what are called “FHIR profiles.” FHIR Profiles <br/>
typically provide additional rules about which resource elements must be used and what <br/>
additional elements have been added that are not part of the base FHIR resource. This can <br/>
include, but not be limited to, rules about which API features are used and how as well as rules <br/>
about which terminologies are used in particular elements. The term “profile” is a general term <br/>
that is used in the FHIR standard to describe either an individual FHIR resource, or an entire <br/>
implementation specification consisting of multiple FHIR resources. Accordingly, we propose to <br/>
adopt three implementation specifications that will establish a standardized baseline and further <br/>
constrain API conformance to help assure that APIs can be used “without special effort.”  <br/>
We propose to adopt in § 170.215(a)(2) an implementation specification that would list a <br/>
set of base FHIR resources that Health IT Modules certified to the proposed criterion in § <br/>
170.315(g)(10) would need to support. We refer to this proposed initial set of FHIR resources as <br/>
the “API Resource Collection in Health” or “the ARCH.” The ARCH would align with and be <br/>
directed by the data policy specified in the proposed US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) <br/>
standard (discussed in section IV.B.1 of this proposed rule).  <br/>
As a result, we propose to include 15 FHIR resources in the ARCH’s first version. Based <br/>
on prior industry efforts, including the Argonaut Project to map FHIR resources to the previously <br/>
defined Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), we know that the following 13 FHIR resources map <br/>
to and support the equivalent data classes specified in the USCDI: AllergyIntolerance; CarePlan; <br/>
Condition; Device; DiagnosticReport; Goal; Immunization; Medication; MedicationOrder; <br/>
MedicationStatement; Observation; Patient; and Procedure. We also propose to include, <br/>

specifically for the Patient resource that the “Patient.address” and “Patient.telecom” elements <br/>
must be supported as part of the Patient resource. These elements are neither required in the base <br/>
FHIR resource or additional implementation specifications; however, they are necessary to align <br/>
with the USCDI’s data requirements. With respect to the Device resource, we propose to require <br/>
that the “Device.udi” element follow the human readable representation of the unique device <br/>
identifier (UDI) found in the recommendation, guidance, and conformance requirements section <br/>
of the “HL7 Version 3 Cross Paradigm Implementation Guide: Medical Devices and Unique <br/>
Device Identification (UDI) Pattern, Release 1,” a document hosted by HL7.<a href="ONCs.html#216">85</a>  Developers <br/>
would be held responsible only for the recommendation, guidance, and conformance <br/>
requirements for HL7 FHIR in the implementation guide and would not be held responsible for <br/>
other requirements in the implementation guide specific to other standards, including <br/>
requirements for HL7 Version 2 and HL7 Version 3. For clarity, these proposed requirements are <br/>
part of the ARCH Version 1 standard. <br/>
In addition to these 13 FHIR resources, we have included two additional FHIR resources: <br/>
1) the Provenance resource; and 2) the DocumentReference resource to accommodate clinical <br/>
notes. These additions would make for a total of 15 FHIR resources to reflect the direction of the <br/>
USCDI v1. With respect to clinical notes, we understand from our own analysis and technical <br/>
discussions within HL7 that the FHIR DocumentReference resource is best capable of handling <br/>
the exchange of clinical notes. Since the CCDS was defined over two years ago, we have most <br/>
frequently heard from provider stakeholders that access to “clinical notes” is key, impactful, and <br/>
highly desirable data that should be accessible via the C-CDAs they exchange as well as via <br/>

APIs. While we realize the industry may need to develop additional implementation guidance to <br/>
support clinical notes via FHIR, we believe that including FHIR resources in ARCH Version 1 <br/>
directly addresses the steady requests we have received from providers to include a focus on the <br/>
access, exchange, and use of “clinical notes” as part of certification. Thus, we propose to include <br/>
the FHIR DocumentReference resource in the ARCH to support clinical notes. We also clarify <br/>
that the clinical note text included in this FHIR resource would need to be represented in its <br/>
“raw” text form. In other words, it would be unacceptable for the note text to be converted to <br/>
another file or format (e.g., .docx, PDF) when it is provided as part of an API response. With <br/>
respect to the Provenance resource, we believe its inclusion in the ARCH is paramount to the <br/>
long-term success and use of FHIR-based APIs. While C-CDA’s are often critiqued due to their <br/>
relative “length,” the C-CDA often represents the output of a clinical event and includes relevant <br/>
context. The same will not always be true in an API-context. This is due to the fact that FHIR-<br/>
based APIs make it significantly easier for apps to request specific data (e.g., just a patient’s <br/>
active medications). Thus, it is equally important over the long-term that the industry not lose <br/>
sight of the metadata (i.e., the who, what, when, where, why, and how) behind the data that was <br/>
created. As a result, we believe that this early stage of FHIR deployment is the best time for the <br/>
industry to build in support for the Provenance resource. Otherwise, if we were to expand the <br/>
ARCH in future years to include this FHIR resource, we estimate that the developer burden and <br/>
overall industry impact would be greater than building this support in “from the start.” <br/>
Specifically, and to remain consistent with the USCDI, we propose to require that the <br/>
“Provenance.recorded” (for the author’s time stamp) and “Provenance.agent.actor” (for the <br/>
author and author’s organization) elements be supported as part of the Provenance resource. <br/>

Over time, and as the USCDI is expanded, we also expect to update this implementation <br/>
specification to expand the ARCH beyond these 15 FHIR resources. Equally, consistent with the  <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirements described in section VII.B.5 of this proposed rule (the <br/>
Standards Version Advancement Process proposals), which would permit health IT developers to <br/>
voluntarily implement and use a new version of an adopted standard or implementation <br/>
specification so long as certain conditions are met including that the new version is approved by <br/>
the National Coordinator for use in certification through the Standards Version Advancement <br/>
Process, health IT developers would be able to update their certified health IT to include (g)(10)-<br/>
certified API access to a broader set of data once a new version of the ARCH is approved.  <br/>
The next implementation specification for the FHIR standard we propose to adopt in § <br/>
170.215(a)(3) is the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide version 1 (Argonaut IG), <br/>
hosted by HL7.<a href="ONCs.html#218">86 </a>This implementation guide has been pilot tested and is now being implemented <br/>
for production use by health IT developers. Notably, it specifies FHIR profile constraints for 13 <br/>
of the associated FHIR resources we propose to include in the ARCH Version 1 and these FHIR <br/>
profiles support the data included in the USCDI (v1).  <br/>
The next implementation specification for the FHIR standard we propose the Secretary <br/>
adopt in § 170.215(a)(4) is the specific portion of the Argonaut IG that refers to the “Argonaut <br/>
Data Query Implementation Guide Server” conformance requirements. While it could be implied <br/>
through our proposed adoption of the Argonaut IG that these conformance requirements would <br/>
be included, we seek to make this an explicit requirement for the API certification criterion <br/>

order to ensure that all FHIR servers are consistently configured to support the defined data <br/>
queries and “supported searches” associated with each Argonaut profiled FHIR resource. For <br/>
clarity, conformance testing would focus on and be limited to the “SHALL” requirements. We <br/>
also note that the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide Server includes conformance <br/>
requirements for the “DocumentReference Profile,” which defines “how a provider or patient can <br/>
retrieve a patient’s existing clinical document.” This particular specification was produced in <br/>
support of the 2015 Edition certification criterion adopted in § 170.315(g)(9). As a result, we <br/>
clarify that this specific portion of the Server IG and conformance requirement would be out of <br/>
scope for the purposes of proposed § 170.315(g)(10).  <br/>
 <br/>
We have separately proposed the FHIR standard and each of these implementation <br/>
specifications so that the National Coordinator may evaluate industry progress and make a <br/>
unique or combined determination as to the appropriate time to approve for voluntary upgrade <br/>
pursuant to the standards version advancement process discussed in more detail in section <br/>
VII.B.5 as well as subsequently go through rulemaking to adopt a new version of: the FHIR <br/>
standard, the ARCH, implementation specifications that “profile” the resources in the ARCH, <br/>
and implementation specifications for FHIR server conformance capabilities. While the proposed <br/>
implementation specifications relate to one another, they can also be updated independently of <br/>
each other as time goes on. For instance, the National Coordinator could approve a new version <br/>
of the FHIR standard “Release 5” in the future in accordance with the standards version <br/>
advancement process. In so doing, the National Coordinator could leave the scope of the ARCH <br/>
the same and update (necessarily) the implementation specifications for the FHIR profiles and <br/>
FHIR server conformance requirements accordingly to align with the new FHIR version. As an <br/>

iii. Proposed Adoption of Standards and Implementation Specifications to <br/>
Support Persistent User Authentication and App Authorization  <br/>
To enable and support persistent user authentication and app authorization processes, we <br/>
propose to adopt a standards and additional implementation specification for the FHIR standard. <br/>
First, we propose to adopt the “OpenID Connect Core 1.0 incorporating errata set 1” standard in <br/>
§ 170.215(b) as it complements the SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation <br/>
Guide Release 1.0.0<a href="ONCs.html#220">87</a> (SMART Guide). The OpenID standard is typically paired with OAuth 2.0 <br/>
implementations and focuses on user authentication. Second, we propose to adopt the SMART <br/>
Guide<i> </i>in § 170.215(a)(5) as an additional implementation specification associated with the FHIR <br/>
standard. This guide is referenced by the Argonaut IG and is generally being implemented by the <br/>
health IT community as a security layer with which FHIR deployment is being combined (from <br/>
both a FHIR server and FHIR application perspective). Further, while the SMART Guide <br/>
includes certain mandatory requirements, we believe three specific aspects are necessary to <br/>
specifically require in order for certification to enable consistent industry-wide implementation. <br/>

 <br/>
The SMART Guide specifies the use of “refresh tokens” as optional. We believe that this <br/>
requirement is necessary in order to enable persistent access by apps, especially in a patient <br/>
access context. Thus, we propose to make their use mandatory with a minimum refresh token life <br/>
of 3 months. While this technique would need to be supported for both types of API-enabled <br/>
services we propose be supported through § 170.315(g)(10), we wish to emphasize that <br/>
implementing refresh token support is directly intended to enable a patient’s “persistent access” <br/>
to their electronic health information without special effort (i.e., without having to frequently re-<br/>
authenticate and re-authorize while using their preferred app). This proposal aligns with the <br/>
industry developed security best practice guidelines for OAuth 2.0 implementations, which <br/>
require support for a short-lived “access token” and a long-lived “refresh token” that could be <br/>
subsequently used by the app to obtain a new “access token” after the original “access token” <br/>
expires. We believe this approach enhances the seamlessness of a patient’s data access and <br/>
reduces the “friction” they would otherwise experience having to re-authenticate and re-<br/>
authorize. At the same time, because the access token is short lived, this minimizes the risk of a <br/>
patient’s information being accessed by unauthorized users if for some reason the access token is <br/>
compromised. The technical capabilities that we intend to explicitly test are referenced as part of <br/>
the proposed API certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(10).  <br/>
We also propose to require that the “Standalone Launch” and “EHR Launch” <br/>
requirements specified in the SMART Guide be supported. We believe that requiring API <br/>
Technology Suppliers to demonstrate both of these capacities will help ensure greater <br/>
standardization and ease of use among (g)(10)-certified APIs. When a third-party “app” first <br/>
connects to a FHIR server, it often requires some contextual data to make the app more “user <br/>

friendly.” This information could include things such as the most recent patient encounter or <br/>
hospital visit. The contextual information depends on how the “app” is launched.  <br/>
When an app is launched from “outside of an EHR,” such as from a patient’s smartphone <br/>
or web browser, then the app is considered to be launched in a “Standalone” mode. In this mode, <br/>
the app has to request that the FHIR server provide appropriate contextual information, which <br/>
can then be used to customize the app’s display for the patient. The SMART Guide has <br/>
standardized the information that such apps can request from FHIR servers and defined it as <br/>
“Standalone Launch.”  <br/>
In other contexts, apps can be launched from “within the EHR.” This is typically the case <br/>
when a third-party app is integrated as part of an EHR technology. In this case, the app is <br/>
considered to have been launched in the “EHR” mode. Typically, when such an app is launched <br/>
from within an EHR, the user (e.g., provider, nurse) has a patient’s record “open” or “active” in <br/>
the EHR and expects the app to directly open the same patient when it is launched. In order for <br/>
this to happen, the app has to request that the FHIR server provides information about the patient <br/>
record that is currently “open” in the EHR. The SMART Guide has standardized this interaction <br/>
and defined it as “EHR Launch.” <br/>

 <br/>
respond with data for each of the data categories specified in the Common Clinical Data Set. <br/>
Moreover, its focus on read-access/response to requests for specific types of data most directly <br/>
aligns with the API uses envisioned by industry stakeholders and the Cures Act, which is why <br/>
we believe it is necessary and appropriate to replace § 170.315(g)(8). In contrast, we do not <br/>
propose that it is necessary to replace the certification criteria adopted in § 170.315(g)(7) and <br/>
(g)(9) because the former does not prescribe specific technical approaches (and can continue to <br/>
be met as technology evolves) and the latter supports a discrete use case relative to an API <br/>
function that responds with a C-CDA.   <br/>
 <br/>
We propose our approach to adopt a replacement for § 170.315(g)(8) that will provide <br/>
clear regulatory compliance requirements for stakeholders because: (1) 2015 Edition testing and <br/>
certification to § 170.315(g)(8) will continue throughout this rulemaking; (2) presuming we <br/>
adopt this (or a modified version of this) proposal in a final rule, it will be easier for the industry <br/>
to distinguish compliance requirements between two separate certification criteria compared to a <br/>
time/context-sensitive “version” of § 170.315(g)(8); and (3) § 170.315(g)(8) is currently <br/>
specified in the Base EHR definition so its replacement has compliance effects on health care <br/>
providers participating in <b>every</b> <b>program</b> that requires the use of Certified EHR Technology, <br/>
which references the Base EHR definition.   <br/>
At a high-level, we propose that this new API certification criterion would require FHIR <br/>
servers to support two types of API-enabled services: <br/>
•  services for which a single patient’s<a href="ONCs.html#223">88</a> data is at focus; and <br/>
                                                 <br/>
88 We recognize that individuals may not always be in an active role as a “patient” when they use an application to <br/>access their data. However, we believe it is clearer for the purposes of readability and policy intent to use the term <br/>“patient” as opposed to “individual.”    <br/>

 <br/>
•  services for which multiple patients’ data are at focus, which, hereafter, we refer to as <br/>
“population-level” to convey the grouped and cohort scope on which the data associated with <br/>
these services would be focused (e.g., a specific provider’s patient panel, all of the patients <br/>
covered by a particular health plan, a group of patients cared for through an alternative <br/>
payment model).   <br/>
This proposed certification criterion would only require mandatory support for “read” <br/>
access for both identified services, though we envision a future version of this certification <br/>
criterion that could include specific “write” conformance requirements (for example, to aid <br/>
decision support) once FHIR-based APIs are widely adopted. In all cases, this proposed criterion <br/>
will require that the two types of API services have appropriate security controls implemented. <br/>
These controls would ensure a user fully authenticates to the API-enabled data source to which <br/>
the request is being made and that the user’s software application is appropriately authorized to <br/>
request specified data. <br/>
API services that focus on a single patient would include, but not be limited to, those that <br/>
interact with software applications controlled and used by a patient to access their data as well as <br/>
software applications implemented by a provider to enhance their own “internal” clinical care <br/>
tools and workflow (e.g., a specialized calculation app). Most, if not all, of these types of <br/>
interactions are typically orchestrated in a synchronous, real to near-real-time mode via APIs.  <br/>
Conversely, API services that focus on multiple patients would include, but not be <br/>
limited to, software applications used by a health care provider to manage various internal <br/>
patient populations as well as external services a health care provider may contract for to support <br/>
quality improvement, population health management, and cost accountability vis-à-vis the <br/>

provider’s partners (e.g., health plans). Historically, access to this kind of computing has often <br/>
been cumbersome, opaque, and required one-off scripting and significant engineering labor with <br/>
no overarching standardized methods. By shifting this paradigm to a FHIR-based API, we <br/>
anticipate that the market will be able to respond with a new slate of innovative solutions. <br/>
 <br/>
Across this spectrum of population-level uses, the scope or quantity of the data may <br/>
range from a small group to many hundreds or thousands of patients. Moreover, when “external” <br/>
applications and services are provided access to patient data by the provider, we expect that such <br/>
access and associated privacy and security protocols would be established consistent with <br/>
existing legal requirements under the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules (including business <br/>
associate agreements), other data use agreements (as applicable), and any other state or federal <br/>
applicable law. Principally, for the purposes of the proposed certification criterion, we seek to <br/>
include and ensure through testing and certification that a set of baseline API functionality exists <br/>
and is deployed for providers to use at their discretion to support their own clinical priorities as <br/>
well as to use to engage with their partners, such as software developers and developers of third-<br/>
party applications.  <br/>
 <br/>
We have explicitly proposed to include support for API services that are population-level <br/>
focused in this certification criterion because the current certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(8) <br/>
has largely been tested, certified, and deployed to support the “patient data request” use case. In <br/>
comparison, population-level focused API services are envisioned to support FHIR-based apps <br/>
that not only improve clinical workflow and decision support but also help advance a learning <br/>
health system. In so doing, providers, payers, and other stakeholders will be able to make <br/>
incrementally better use of FHIR’s RESTful API and JSON payload to apply modern computing <br/>

techniques, including big data analyses and machine learning, to account for, assess, and inform <br/>
the quality and effectiveness of care delivered. As noted in the proposed API standards section, <br/>
FHIR Release 4 includes technical specifications to enable standardized population-level <br/>
services via FHIR-based APIs in a more efficient manner than currently possible. If “Option 3” <br/>
or “Option 4” is preferred by industry in terms of the FHIR standards options for this <br/>
certification criterion, these approaches would be demonstrable. Alternatively, if the National <br/>
Coordinator were to approve FHIR Release 4 for use under this proposed certification criterion <br/>
(following the Standards Version Advancement Process described in Section VII.B.5 of this <br/>
preamble) then it would be able to be used to meet these technical expectations.  <br/>
Lastly, as we considered the necessary oversight responsibilities the Cures Act adds to <br/>
the Program, we have determined that it would be essential to include a specific population-level <br/>
API conformance requirement as part of this criterion so that such capabilities could be evaluated <br/>
post-certification for compliance with (among other requirements) this API Condition of <br/>
Certification and the information blocking and real world testing Conditions of Certification.    <br/>
<b>Specific Proposals </b><br/>
In general, we have approached framing § 170.315(g)(10) in the same way we framed § <br/>
170.315(g)(8). This new proposed criterion, however, includes some important differences and <br/>
specificity compared to § 170.315(g)(8). Taken together, the following proposals are designed to <br/>
establish a consistent set of API implementation requirements aimed at the API Condition of <br/>
Certification’s “without special effort” requirement. We propose that API technology presented <br/>

 <br/>
testing and certification to the proposed certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(10) would need to <br/>
meet the requirements outlined below. We seek comment on all of the following proposals. <br/>
<i> </i><br/>
<i>Data Response  </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose in § 170.315(g)(10)(i) that the health IT presented for testing and <br/>
certification must be capable of responding to requests for data on a single patient and multiple <br/>
patients associated with each of the FHIR resources specified in ARCH Version 1 and consistent <br/>
with FHIR Release 2 and the Argonaut IG implementation specification. More specifically, we <br/>
clarify that all data elements indicated as “mandatory” and “must support” by the proposed <br/>
standards and implementation specifications must be supported and would be in scope for <br/>
testing. Through this approach, certification will provide for a consistent and predictable starting <br/>
scope of data from which apps and other services can be developed. <br/>
<i>Search Support </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose to require in § 170.315(g)(10)(ii) that the health IT presented for testing and <br/>
certification must be capable of responding to all of the “supported searches” specified in the <br/>
Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide Server, which as a reminder we have proposed for <br/>
adoption as an implementation specification in § 170.215(a)(4).<a href="ONCs.html#227">89</a> Given that there is not yet a <br/>
consistent, standardized specification for FHIR servers to handle searches for multiple patients, <br/>
we clarify that a health IT developer would be permitted to approach searches for multiple <br/>
patients in the manner it deems most efficient to meet this proposed certification criterion. We <br/>
note, consistent with the implementation specifications current scope, that conformance would <br/>
focus on search associated with a single patient’s data. However, we reiterate the health IT <br/>
                                                 <br/>

presented for testing and certification and as implemented must support searches for multiple <br/>
patients independent of a required standard for such searches. <br/>
For the DocumentReference and Provenance resources, which are currently present in the <br/>
base FHIR standard, we request comments on the minimum “search” parameters that would need <br/>
to be supported. <br/>
<i>App Registration  </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose in § 170.315(g)(10)(iii) that health IT presented for testing and certification <br/>
must be capable of enabling apps to register with an “authorization server.” This proposed <br/>
conformance requirement would require an API Technology Supplier to demonstrate its <br/>
registration process, but would not require that it be done according to a specific standard. We <br/>
considered proposing the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591"> (RFC 7591)</a> standard <br/>
(“Dynamic Registration”) as the only way to support registration for this certification criterion <br/>
and request public comment on whether we should require its support as part of a final rule’s <br/>
certification criterion. For clarity, we note that while we have not explicitly required Dynamic <br/>
Registration as the only way to demonstrate conformance with this specific portion of the <br/>
certification criterion, API Technology Suppliers would still be allowed to use Dynamic <br/>
Registration if they so choose. <br/>
 <br/>
While requiring Dynamic Registration could create a more consistent registration <br/>
experience for health IT developers, we did not expressly include this standard because of its <br/>
relatively low adoption and implementation in the health IT ecosystem. Notably, while the <br/>
SMART Guide covers a majority of technical steps necessary for an app to connect a FHIR <br/>
server, it is neutral on the registration process API Technology Suppliers could take. Much like <br/>

 <br/>
we did with § 170.315(g)(8) in the initial 2015 Edition final rule by not requiring FHIR, we <br/>
believe that a prudent approach for registration is to require that it be addressed from a functional <br/>
perspective while the industry reaches consensus on the best techniques to enable registration.  <br/>
Note, that while this portion of proposed § 170.315(g)(10) focuses on the technical <br/>
standards conformance, we have also included a specific “maintenance requirement” associated <br/>
with the API Condition of Certification around the timeliness of this registration process in <br/>
production settings as applicable to API Technology Suppliers. This proposed requirement will <br/>
ensure that patients are able to use their apps in a timely manner. <br/>
 <br/>
We do not intend to test registration capabilities for apps that would be executed within <br/>
an API Data Provider’s clinical environment. We believe this discretion is warranted as API <br/>
Technology Suppliers and API Data Providers are best poised to innovate and execute various <br/>
methods for app registration within a clinical environment. However, we request comment on <br/>
this perspective. <br/>
<i>Secure connection, authentication and authorization </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose in § 170.315(g)(10)(iv) that the health IT presented for testing and <br/>
certification must be capable of establishing a secure and trusted connection with an application <br/>
that requests patient data in accordance with the SMART Guide<i>.</i> In the context of this proposed <br/>
criterion, this would require that an “authorization server” be deployed and support, at a <br/>
minimum, “authorize” and “token” endpoints and the publication of the endpoint URLs via <br/>
FHIR server’s metadata as specified in the SMART Guide to enable automated discovery by <br/>
apps. Again, we note, consistent with this implementation specification’s current scope, that <br/>
initial conformance would focus on the secure connection parameters with a single patient’s data <br/>

in mind. Given that there is not yet a consistent, standardized specification for FHIR servers to <br/>
handle secure connection parameters for multiple patients, we clarify that a health IT developer <br/>
would be permitted to approach secure connections for multiple patients in the manner it deems <br/>
most efficient to meet this proposed certification criterion. <br/>
 <br/>
When an application connects to request data for the first time, we propose in § <br/>
170.315(g)(10)(v)(A) that health IT presented for testing and certification must be capable of <br/>
demonstrating support for user authentication according to the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 <br/>
incorporating errata set 1<a href="ONCs.html#230">90 </a>standard. It should be noted that the OpenID Connect Standard is <br/>
agnostic to the actual authentication mechanism used by the health IT while providing a standard <br/>
way for health IT to exchange the authentication information to the app. The primary benefit <br/>
being that it lets apps verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by <br/>
the Authorization Server without having the apps to take additional responsibility for <br/>
authenticating the user. We also propose in § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(B) that health IT presented for <br/>
testing and certification must demonstrate that users can authorize applications (in the <br/>
appropriate context) to access data in accordance with the SMART Guide<i>.</i> Pursuant to this <br/>
proposed implementation specification described above, we also intend to test health IT in the <br/>
“Standalone Launch” and “EHR Launch” modes. Additionally, we clarify that for the purposes <br/>
of testing and certification, we propose to require that health IT support only a limited set of <br/>
capabilities related to the OpenID Connect Standard—specifically, only those that are specified <br/>
in the SMART Guide.  <br/>

 <br/>
Further, in order to enable patients and providers to get persistent access to health <br/>
information without having to re-authenticate and re-authorize, we propose to require that a <br/>
“refresh token” must be provided with an expiration period of at least 3 months from the date <br/>
issued. The “refresh token” could be subsequently used by the app to obtain a new “access <br/>
token” after the expiration of the original “access token.” Note the proposed refresh token <br/>
requirement is different than providing an “access token” with an extended life, which is <br/>
typically discouraged from a security best practice perspective so as to prevent unauthorized <br/>
access if for some reason the access token were to be acquired for use by an unauthorized <br/>
application. <br/>
 <br/>
We propose in § 170.315(g)(10)(vi) that health IT presented for testing and certification <br/>
must demonstrate that it can support subsequent connections by an app and requests data without <br/>
requiring the user to re-authorize and re-authenticate when a valid refresh token is supplied. <br/>
Further, we propose that once a valid refresh token has been used to get a new access token that <br/>
the FHIR server must demonstrate that it can issue a new refresh token to the app, which must be <br/>
for a new period no shorter than three months. For example, if an application were issued a <br/>
refresh token that was good for three months upon its first-ever connection and then <br/>
subsequently connected to the FHIR server one month later, the FHIR server would need to <br/>
enable that connection to occur without re-authentication and re-authorization, and it would need <br/>
to issue a new refresh token for a new three-month period from that access date. Again, we <br/>
intend to test health IT in the “Standalone Launch” and “EHR Launch” contexts pursuant to the <br/>
SMART Guide. <br/>

 <br/>
We have proposed this renewal requirement because industry stakeholders at various <br/>
meetings and conferences at which we have attended have indicated that a constant need for <br/>
patients to re-authenticate and re-authorize their apps creates usability challenges and may <br/>
otherwise contradict the Cures Act’s intent associated with the phrase “without special effort.” <br/>
Further, we are not aware of a standard, consistent methodology for specifying the lifetime of <br/>
refresh tokens in published technical specifications. As a result, we believe our approach would <br/>
improve the current user experience for patients and providers alike. Additionally, authorization <br/>
servers maintain binding between the refresh token and the application to whom it was issued, <br/>
and hence can protect against misuse by unauthorized applications. <br/>
We believe that the three-month period is a reasonable length given the proposal for the <br/>
re-issuance of a new refresh token. However, we acknowledge that this same policy outcome we <br/>
discuss above could be achieved by, for example, having a two-month period. Accordingly, we <br/>
seek comment on whether there are available specifications we should review as well as whether <br/>
there should be a reasonable upper bound from a timing perspective (e.g., one year) after which <br/>
the user should be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize. <br/>
For both the first time connection and subsequent connection proposals, we recognize <br/>
that there is not yet a consistent, standardized specification for FHIR servers to handle data <br/>
requests for multiple patients. As noted above, we expect that FHIR Release 4 will have such <br/>
specificity. However, for the purposes of meeting this proposed certification criterion, we clarify <br/>
that a health IT developer would be permitted to approach requests for multiple patients in the <br/>
manner it deems most efficient.  <br/>

In the 2015 Edition final rule we included transparent documentation requirements for all <br/>
three of the API-focused certification criteria adopted in § 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(9). These <br/>
requirements specified that documentation associated with API syntax (and other technical <br/>
descriptors), the software components and configurations that would be necessary in order for a <br/>
deployed API to successfully work, and the terms of use for the API be made publicly available. <br/>
We continue to believe that such a requirement is important for proposed § 170.315(g)(10), <br/>
especially in light of the Cures Act’s “without special effort” provision. Such transparency and <br/>
openness is commonplace in many other industries and has fueled innovation, growth, and <br/>
competition. Further, we believe that full transparency is necessary to ensure that software <br/>
developers building to a health IT developer’s (g)(10)-certified API have a thorough <br/>
understanding of any requirements against which their software will need to be designed. <br/>
In reconciling the 2015 Edition final rule’s API documentation requirements with the <br/>
new expectations set forth by the Cures Act regarding a health IT developer’s practices, we have <br/>
determined that revisions are necessary. Accordingly, we propose to revise the documentation <br/>
provision in the API certification criteria adopted in § 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(9) as well as <br/>
reflect the same revision in proposed § 170.315(g)(10) and (11). Specifically, we propose to <br/>
focus the documentation requirement set forth by the certification criteria on solely the technical <br/>
documentation associated with the API technology. As a result, we propose to remove the <br/>
provision in § 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(9) associated with “terms of use” as this type of <br/>
documentation could be considered more reflective of business practice and better placed with <br/>
other similar requirements. Consistent with the Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification, we <br/>
have proposed more detailed Condition of Certification requirements associated with a health IT <br/>

developer’s API terms of use in order to address business practices that could interfere with and <br/>
create special effort on the part of an API User. <br/>
With respect to the technical documentation that would need to be made publicly <br/>
available, we recognize that our proposed formal adoption of the FHIR standard and the <br/>
associated implementation specifications (for § 170.315(g)(10)) would be consistent across all <br/>
health IT presented for certification. As a result there may be minimal additional documentation <br/>
needed for these capabilities beyond what is already documented in these standards and <br/>
specifications. However, pursuant to the limited mandatory scope proposed for “data response” <br/>
(for § 170.315(g)(10)), we believe that API Technology Suppliers should disclose any additional <br/>
data their (g)(10)-certified API supports in the context of FHIR resources referenced in ARCH <br/>
Version1  and associated implementation specifications. For example, the Argonaut IG “Patient <br/>
Profile” includes optional elements for marital status, photo, and contact (as in contact person <br/>
like a guardian or friend). To the degree that a (g)(10)-certified API supports such optional data <br/>
an API Technology Supplier would be required to convey this support in its published technical <br/>
documentation. Additionally, we note that other specifications, like the RFC 7591, provide <br/>
developers some latitude in terms of the information that could be supplied for the purposes of <br/>
registration. <br/>
Thus, we propose in § 170.315(g)(10)(vii) that an API Technology Supplier would need <br/>
to provide detailed information for all aspects of its (g)(10)-certified API, especially for any <br/>
unique technical requirements and configurations, such as how the FHIR server handles requests <br/>
for multiple patients (until such time as there is an approved standardized approach that can be <br/>
cited) as well as app registration requirements. For aspects that are not unique and are fully <br/>

specified by the FHIR standard and associated implementation specifications, the developer <br/>
could include hyperlinks to this information as part of its overall documentation. Further, we <br/>
propose to include the word “complete” in the documentation provision in order to make this <br/>
point explicit and link this obligation to the associated transparency conditions proposed as part <br/>
of the overall Condition of Certification. We note for health IT developers that the <br/>
documentation published must be of the sort and to the level of specificity, precision, and detail <br/>
that the health IT developer customarily provides to its own employees, contractors, and/or <br/>
partners who develop software applications for production environments. <br/>

accessible to the public via a hyperlink without additional access requirements, including, <br/>
without limitation, any form of registration, account creation, “click-through” agreements, or <br/>
requirement to provide contact details or other information prior to accessing the documentation. <br/>
It would also require that such documentation needs to be submitted as part of testing for this <br/>
certification criterion and subsequently to ONC-ACBs for review prior to issuing a certification.   <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
d. Condition of Certification Requirements  <br/>
To implement the Cures Act, we have designed this API Condition of Certification in a <br/>
manner that will complement the technical capabilities described in our other proposals, while <br/>
addressing the broader technology and business landscape in which these API capabilities will be <br/>
deployed and used.  <br/>
 <br/>
Consistent with the attributes we have identified for the statutory phrase “without special <br/>
effort,” our overarching vision for this Condition of Certification is to ensure that (g)(10)-<br/>
certified APIs, among all API technology, are deployed in a manner that supports an experience <br/>

 <br/>
that is as seamless and frictionless as possible. To that end, we seek to promote a standards-based <br/>
ecosystem that is transparent, scalable, and open to robust competition and innovation. <br/>
The specific requirements of this Condition of Certification are discussed in several <br/>
sections below. These requirements would address certain implementation, maintenance, and <br/>
business practices for which clear and consistent parameters are needed to ensure that API <br/>
technology is deployed in a manner that achieves the policy goals we have described. The <br/>
proposed requirements would also align this Condition of Certification with other requirements <br/>
and policies of the Cures Act that promote interoperability and deter information blocking, as <br/>
discussed in more detail in the sections that follow. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
i. Scope and Compliance <br/>
To start this Condition of Certification, we propose in § 170.404 to apply this Condition <br/>
of Certification to health IT developers with health IT certified to <b>any</b> of the API-focused <br/>
certification criteria. These criteria include the proposed “standardized API for patient and <br/>
population services” (§ 170.315(g)(10)) and “consent management for APIs” (§ 170.315(g)(11)) <br/>
as well as the current “application access – patient selection” (§ 170.315(g)(7)), “application <br/>
access – data category request” (§ 170.315(g)(8)), “application access – all data request” (§ <br/>
170.315(g)(9)). In other words, this entire Condition of Certification <b>would not</b> apply to health <br/>
IT developers that do not have technology certified to any of these API-focused certification <br/>
criteria. Similarly, this condition is solely applicable to these API-focused certification criteria. <br/>
As a result, the proposed policies for this Condition of Certification <b>would not</b> apply to a health <br/>
IT developer’s practices associated with, for example, the immunization reporting certification <br/>
criterion adopted in § 170.315(f)(1) because that criterion is not one of the API-focused criteria. <br/>

has not yet been placed on public display or published in the Federal Register.  The document may vary slightly <br/>

 <br/>
However, health IT developers should remain mindful that other proposals in this proposed rule, <br/>
especially those related to information blocking, could still apply to its practices associated with <br/>
non-API-focused certification criteria.  <br/>
Given the proposed applicability of this condition to current API-focused criteria and that <br/>
health IT developers with products certified to §§ 170.315(g)(7)-(9) would need to meet new <br/>
compliance requirements associated with such criteria, we also propose certain compliance <br/>
timelines associated with this Condition of Certification that would need to be met.  <br/>
ii. Cures Act Condition and Interpretation of Access to “All Data <br/>
Elements” <br/>
First, we propose to adopt the Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification in § <br/>
170.404(a)(1) to fully incorporate the statute’s compliance requirements. Second, strictly for the <br/>
scope of the API Condition of Certification, we propose to interpret the meaning of the phrase <br/>
“all data elements of a patient’s electronic health record” as follows.  <br/>
For the reasons discussed above, the proposed § 170.315(g)(10) certification criterion and <br/>
associated standards and implementation specifications would facilitate API access to a limited <br/>
set of data elements (i.e., from the FHIR resources that ARCH Version 1).  Accordingly, for the <br/>
purposes of meeting this portion of the Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification, we interpret <br/>
the scope of: the ARCH; its associated implementation specifications; and the policy expressed <br/>
around the data elements that must be supported by (g)(10)-certified APIs (i.e., FHIR servers) to <br/>
constitute “all data elements.” Given other proposals related to permitting the use of updated <br/>
versions of adopted standards and implementation specifications, we expect that (g)(10)-certified <br/>
APIs will be able to support access to more data over time in response to updates to the USCDI <br/>

 <br/>
and the ARCH. As these updates occur, the industry would be able to incrementally approach the <br/>
totality of data that can be electronically accessed, exchanged, and used pursuant to the Cures <br/>
Act’s reference to “all data elements.”  <br/>
Again, we reiterate that this specific interpretation <b>does not</b> extend beyond the API <br/>
Condition of Certification and cannot be inferred to reduce the scope or applicability of other <br/>
Cures Act Conditions of Certification or the information blocking proposals, which necessarily <br/>
will include a larger scope of data. For example, other Conditions of Certification will apply to <br/>
health IT developer behaviors associated with data that are not part of the USCDI or ARCH, <br/>
such as the proposals at 45 CFR 170.402 and the proposals in Part 171, which apply across <br/>
several stakeholders including health information networks and health care providers. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
iii. Transparency Conditions  <br/>
 <br/>
 We propose as part of this Condition of Certification that API Technology Suppliers be <br/>
required to make specific business and technical documentation freely and publicly accessible. <br/>
Thus, we propose to adopt several transparency conditions as part of § 170.404(a)(2).  <br/>
Similar to our policy associated with the API-focused certification criteria, we propose in <br/>
§ 170.404(a)(2)(i) that all published documentation be complete and available via a publicly <br/>
accessible hyperlink that allows any person to directly access the information without any <br/>
preconditions or additional steps. For example, the API Technology Supplier cannot impose any <br/>
access requirements, including, without limitation, any form of registration, account creation, <br/>
“click-through” agreements, or requirement to provide contact details or other information prior <br/>
to accessing the documentation.  <br/>

 <br/>
In addition to technical documentation, we propose in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(A) to require <br/>
API Technology Suppliers to publish all terms and conditions for use of its API technology. We <br/>
believe that it is important to make this information readily accessible to API Data Providers, <br/>
API Users, app developers, and other persons. This transparency would ensure that these <br/>
stakeholders do not experience “special effort” in the form of unnecessary costs or delays to <br/>
obtain the terms and conditions for API technology. Further, we believe that full transparency is <br/>
necessary to ensure that app developers have a thorough understanding in advance of any terms <br/>
or conditions that might apply to them and do not encounter unanticipated hurdles once they <br/>
have committed to developing software or attempt to implement or deploy such software in <br/>
production.  <br/>
 <br/>
We note that this requirement would apply to <i>all </i>terms and conditions that apply to the <br/>
API technology and its use. As noted above, and for the purposes of this proposal’s scope, “API <br/>
technology” refers to the specified API capabilities for Health IT Modules certified to § <br/>
170.315(g)(7) through (11) under the Program. We consider “terms and conditions” to include <br/>
any fees, restrictions, limitations, obligations, registration process requirements, and other terms <br/>
or conditions that would be material and needed to:  <br/>
•  develop software applications to interact with the API technology;  <br/>
•  distribute, deploy, and enable the use of software applications in production environments <br/>
that use the API technology;  <br/>
•  use software applications, including to access, exchange, and use EHI by means of the API <br/>
technology; <br/>
•  use any EHI obtained by means of the API technology; and <br/>

In addition, we propose in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(B) that any and all permitted fees charged <br/>
by an API Technology Supplier for the use of its API technology must be published and <br/>
described in detailed, plain language as part of its publicly available terms and conditions. The <br/>
description of the fees must include all material information, including, but not limited to, the <br/>
persons or classes of persons to whom the fee applies; the circumstances in which the fee <br/>
applies; and the amount of the fee, which for variable fees must include the specific variable(s) <br/>
and methodology(ies) that will be used to calculate the fee.  <br/>
 <br/>
For the purposes of the specific transparency conditions proposed in § 170.404(a)(2) and <br/>
their relationship and applicability to API Technology Suppliers with products already certified <br/>
to § 170.315(g)(7) , (8), or (9), we propose to establish a compliance date of six months from the <br/>
final rule’s effective date (which would give developers approximately eight months from the <br/>
final rule’s publication date) to revise their existing API documentation to come into compliance <br/>
with the final rule. We also recognize that API Technology Suppliers will need to update the <br/>
proposed publicly available information from time to time. Thus, for the purposes of and with <br/>
respect to subsequent updates to this information, we expect API technology suppliers to make <br/>
clear to the public the timing information applicable to their disclosures (e.g., effective/as of date <br/>
or last updated date) in order to prevent out of sync discrepancies in what an API Technology <br/>
Supplier’s public documentation states and what it may be communicating directly to its <br/>
customers (e.g., a change in fees is directly communicated to customers but not reflected at the <br/>
publicly available hyperlink pursuant to its responsibilities under this proposal). If an API <br/>
Technology Supplier’s actions are out of sync with its publicly provided documentation, the API <br/>

Technology Supplier would be at risk of violating this Condition of Certification. We request <br/>
public comment on whether this expectation should be formally specified in regulation text or if <br/>
these “effective date” approaches for changes to transparency documentation are common place <br/>
such that it would be a standard practice as part of making this documentation available.    <br/>
We also note that API Technology Suppliers would be expected to revise and/or <br/>
construct terms and conditions for its API technology that account for and reflect the proposals <br/>
associated with this API Condition of Certification and information blocking policies. In so far <br/>
as an API Technology Supplier would find it necessary to enforce its published terms and <br/>
conditions, we caution API Technology Suppliers to be mindful of whether such terms and <br/>
conditions would be acceptable and consistent with the aforementioned policies in the first <br/>
place—as an impermissible term or condition would be problematic regardless of whether it was <br/>
actively enforced.  <br/>
We propose in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(C) a final transparency condition associated with API <br/>
Technology Suppliers’ application developer verification processes that takes into account the <br/>
fact that we did not propose to adopt the Dynamic Registration standard as part of proposed § <br/>
170.315(g)(10). Had we proposed requiring Dynamic Registration, we would have also proposed <br/>
a specific Condition of Certification that would have outright prohibited API Technology <br/>
Suppliers from identity proofing or verifying authenticity of an app developer when it came to <br/>
apps that were designed to enable patient access.  <br/>
On balance, however, we believe that permitting API Technology Suppliers to institute a <br/>
process to verify the authenticity of application developers will foster additional trust in the <br/>
growing API ecosystem. We seek comments and recommendations on factors that would enable <br/>

registration with minimal barriers. For example, permitting API Technology Suppliers to do one-<br/>
time verification of the app developers (or even rely on centralized vetting by a trusted third <br/>
party), which would allow the developer’s future apps to automatically register without case-by-<br/>
case checks (or checks for each API Technology Supplier with which the app developer <br/>
interacts). One risk to consider with Dynamic Registration plus a prohibition on vetting, for <br/>
instance, is that it would be much easier for a malicious app developer to spoof another <br/>
legitimate app developer’s app. Such an action could ultimately lead to confusion and distrust in <br/>
the market. However, the Dynamic Registration option would minimize barriers to registration <br/>
especially for third-party apps designed to enable patient access. We seek comments on options <br/>
and trade-offs we should consider. <br/>
Accordingly, and weighing those concerns with the Cures Act’s “without special effort” <br/>
provision and our proposed information blocking policies, we specifically propose to permit API <br/>
Technology Suppliers to institute a process to verify the authenticity of application developers so <br/>
long as such process is completed within five business days <a href="ONCs.html#242">91</a> of receipt of an application <br/>
developer’s request to register their software application with the API technology’s authorization <br/>
server. To clarify, this verification process would need to focus specifically on the application <br/>
developer—not its software application(s). We also clarify that API Technology Suppliers would <br/>
have the discretion to establish their verification process so long as the process is objective and <br/>
the same for all application developers and it can reasonably be completed within the five <br/>
business days—otherwise such a process could risk implicating/violating other elements of this <br/>

proposed API Condition of Certification as well as information blocking behaviors. The <br/>
following includes a few non-exhaustive examples of verification techniques that could be used <br/>
by an API Technology Supplier to have additional certainty about the application developer with <br/>
whom they are interacting: instituting a “penny verification” process, requiring some form of <br/>
corporate documentation, or requesting other forms of authenticating documentation or <br/>
transactions.  <br/>
We believe that five business days is sufficient time for API Technology Suppliers to <br/>
weed out malicious developers seeking to deceive the API Technology Supplier, API Data <br/>
Providers or API Users, but request public comment on other timing considerations. Moreover, <br/>
we clarify that this proposed Condition of Certification is meant to set the upper bound for a <br/>
verification process an API Technology Supplier would be permitted to take and should <b>not</b> be <br/>
interpreted as compelling API Technology Suppliers to institute such a process (i.e., API <br/>
Technology Suppliers would not be required to institute a verification process). Rather, for those <br/>
API Technology Suppliers that see it in their (as well as their customers and patients) best <br/>
interests to institute such a process, we have laid out the rules that we believe meet the Cures <br/>
Act’s without special effort expectations. If an API Technology Supplier chooses not to institute <br/>
an app developer verification process prior to enabling the production use of an app, it would <br/>
solely need to meet the Maintenance of Certification requirement associated with enabling apps <br/>
for production use discussed in more detail below.  <br/>
We remind stakeholders that even in the case where an API Technology Supplier chooses <br/>
not to vet app developers, the apps would <i>not</i> have carte blanche access to a health care <br/>
provider’s data. To the contrary, such apps will still be registered and thus be identifiable and <br/>

able to have their access deactivated by an API Technology Supplier or health care provider <br/>
(API Data Provider) if they behave in anomalous or malicious ways (e.g., denial of service <br/>
attack). And a patient seeking access to their data using the app will need to authenticate <br/>
themselves (using previously issued credentials by a health care provider or trusted source) and <br/>
authorize: 1) the app to connect to the FHIR server; and 2) specify the scope of the data the app <br/>
may access.  <br/>
 <br/>
As a separate matter, we also recognize that in order to assure health care providers that <br/>
the apps they use within their health IT will operate appropriately, will fully integrate into <br/>
workflow, and will not degrade overall system performance, that API Technology Suppliers may <br/>
establish additional mechanisms to vet app developers. Such mechanisms could fit into the <br/>
“value-added services” permitted fee and result in the app being acknowledged or listed by the <br/>
health IT developer in some special manner (e.g., in an “app store,” “verified app” list). While <br/>
our proposals do not specify any explicit limits to the nature and governance of these approaches, <br/>
we wish to caution health IT developers that even though such processes have a reasoned basis in <br/>
providing an added layer of trust above and beyond the basic production-readiness of an app, <br/>
they can equally be used as a means to prevent, limit, and otherwise frustrate innovation, <br/>
competition, and access to the market. Such an outcome would be inconsistent with the Cures <br/>
Act, could directly violate the specific Condition of Certification associated with fees permitted <br/>
for value-added services, and could constitute information blocking. <br/>

 <br/>
As part of this API Condition of Certification, we propose to adopt specific conditions <br/>
that would set boundaries for the fees API Technology Suppliers would be permitted to charge <br/>
and to whom those permitted fees could be charged.  As a reminder, these proposals would only <br/>
apply to a health IT developer’s business practices associated with its “API technology” (i.e., the <br/>
capabilities certified to § 170.315(g)(7) through (11)). We seek comment on all of the following <br/>
proposals. <br/>
In § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(A), we propose to establish a general prohibition on API <br/>
Technology Suppliers imposing fees associated with API technology. This general prohibition is <br/>
meant to ensure that API Technology Suppliers do not engage in pricing practices that create <br/>
barriers to entry and competition for apps and API-based services that health care providers seek <br/>
to use. These outcomes would be inconsistent with the goal of enabling API-based access, <br/>
exchange, and use of EHI by patients and other stakeholders without special effort.  <br/>
 <br/>
In establishing this general prohibition, we have been mindful of the need for API <br/>
Technology Suppliers to recover their costs and to earn a reasonable return on their investments <br/>
in providing API technology that has been certified under the Program. Accordingly, we have <br/>
identified categories of “permitted fees” that API Technology Suppliers would be permitted to <br/>
charge and still be compliant with the Condition of Certification and Program requirements, and <br/>
discuss these proposals below. We emphasize, however, and propose in detail below, that API <br/>
Technology Suppliers would not be permitted in any way whatsoever to impose fees on any <br/>
person in connection with an API Technology Supplier’s work to support the use of API <br/>
technology to facilitate a patient’s ability to access, exchange, or use their EHI. <br/>

 <br/>
We note that other than for fees charged for “value-added services” (proposed in § <br/>
170.404(a)(3)(iv)), the fees permitted under this Condition of Certification must arise between an <br/>
API Technology Supplier and an API Data Provider. Any fee that arises in connection with an <br/>
API User’s use of API technology would need to exist solely between the API Data Provider and <br/>
the API User. This policy reinforces the autonomy that we believe API Data Providers should <br/>
have to establish relationships with API Users. However, as discussed in detail below, API <br/>
Technology Suppliers would be permitted to charge API Data Providers based on the usage <br/>
activities of API Users.  <br/>
We also seek to clarify that while the proposed permitted fees set the boundaries for the <br/>
fees API Technology Suppliers would be permitted to charge and to whom those permitted fees <br/>
could be charged, they do not prohibit who may pay the API Technology Supplier’s permitted <br/>
fee. In other words, these conditions limit the party from which an API Technology Supplier <br/>
may require payment, but they do not speak to who may pay the fee. For example, if through <br/>
some type of relationship/agreement an API User or other party offered to pay the fee an API <br/>
Data Provider owed to an API Technology Supplier, that practice would be allowed and <br/>
unaffected under these conditions. This is an acceptable practice because the fee is first arrived at <br/>
between the API Technology Supplier and API Data Provider, and then API Technology <br/>
Supplier receives payment from another party via the API Data Provider or directly on behalf of <br/>
the API Data Provider. As a general matter, we note that stakeholders should be mindful of other <br/>
federal and state laws and regulations that could prohibit or limit certain types of relationships <br/>
involving remuneration. <br/>

 <br/>
We note that the proposed “permitted fees conditions” align with the requirements of the <br/>
information blocking exceptions proposed in 45 CFR 171.204 and 171.206. Any fee that would <br/>
not be covered by those exceptions, and that would, therefore, be suspect under the information <br/>
blocking provision, would equally not be permitted by this API Condition of Certification. We <br/>
strongly encourage readers to review our proposals associated with those exceptions, which are <br/>
contained in sections VIII.D.4 and VIII.D.6 of this preamble, respectively. <br/>
<i>Permitted Fees – General Conditions </i><br/>
We propose in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B) general conditions that an API Technology <br/>
Supplier’s fee must satisfy in order for such fee to be expressly permitted and thus not <br/>
contravene the proposed Condition of Certification. First, we propose in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)<i>(1)</i> <br/>
that in order to be a permitted fee, a fee imposed by an API Technology Supplier must be based <br/>
on objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly applied for all substantially similar or <br/>
similarly situated classes of persons and requests. This would require an API Technology <br/>
Supplier to apply fee criteria that, among other things, would lead an API Technology Supplier <br/>
to come to the same conclusion with respect to the permitted fee’s amount each time it interacted <br/>
with a class of persons or responded to a request. Accordingly, the fee could not be based on the <br/>
API Technology Supplier’s subjective judgment or discretion. <br/>
Moreover, in order to be permitted, the fee must not be based in any part on whether the <br/>
API User is a competitor or potential competitor, or on whether the API Data Provider or API <br/>
User will be using the data accessed via the API technology in a way that facilitates competition <br/>
with the API Technology Supplier. This condition is intended to ensure that any fee charged by <br/>
an API Technology Supplier does not have the purpose or effect of excluding or creating <br/>

 <br/>
impediments for competitors, business rivals, or other persons engaged in developing or enabling <br/>
the use of API technology. We believe these fee limitations are necessary in light of the potential <br/>
for API Technology Suppliers to use their control over API technology to engage in <br/>
discriminatory practices that create barriers to API technology. These principles are consistent <br/>
with the approach described in section VIII of this preamble (“information blocking”).  <br/>
Second, we propose in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)<i>(2)</i> that in order to be a permitted fee, a fee <br/>
imposed by an API Technology Supplier must be reasonably related to the API Technology <br/>
Supplier’s costs of supplying and, if applicable, supporting the API technology to, or at the <br/>
request of, the API Data Provider to whom the fee is charged. For example, the API Technology <br/>
Supplier would not be permitted to charge a fee when the underlying costs relevant to the supply <br/>
or service have already been accounted for or recovered through other fees (regardless of <br/>
whether such fees were charged to the API Data Provider or to other persons). Moreover, an API <br/>
Technology Supplier that conditioned access to its API technology on revenue-sharing or the <br/>
entry into a royalty agreement would be at significant risk of imposing a fee that bore no <br/>
plausible relation to the costs incurred by the API Technology Supplier to develop the API <br/>
technology or support its use by API Users.  <br/>
Third, we propose in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)<i>(3)</i> to require that in order to be a permitted <br/>
fee, the costs of supplying, and if applicable, supporting the API technology upon which the fee <br/>
is based must be reasonably allocated among all customers to whom the API technology is <br/>
supplied or for whom it is supported. A reasonable allocation of costs would require that the API <br/>
Technology Supplier allocate its costs in accordance with criteria that are reasonable and <br/>
between only those API Data Providers that either cause the costs to be incurred or benefit from <br/>

the associated supply or support of the API technology. If an API Technology Supplier <br/>
developed API technology that could be supplied to multiple customers with minimal tailoring, <br/>
the core costs of developing its API technology should be allocated among those customers when <br/>
recovered as a fee. The API Technology Supplier would not be permitted to recover the total of <br/>
its core costs from each customer. Similarly, when an API Technology Supplier uses shared <br/>
facilities and resources to support the usage of API technology, it would need to ensure that <br/>
those shared costs were reasonably allocated between all of the customers that benefited from <br/>
them. However, whenever an API Technology Supplier is required to provide services and incur <br/>
costs that are unique to a particular customer, it would not need to distribute those costs among <br/>
other customers that had deployed its API technology. <br/>
Last, we propose in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)<i>(4)</i> to require that in order to be a permitted fee, <br/>
the API Technology Supplier must ensure that fees are not be based in any part on whether the <br/>
requestor or other person is a competitor, potential competitor, or will be using the API <br/>
technology in a way that facilitates competition with the API Technology Supplier. The use of <br/>
such criteria would be suspect because it suggests the fee the API Technology Supplier is <br/>
charging is not based on its reasonable costs to provide the API technology or services and may <br/>
have the purpose or effect of excluding or creating impediments for competitors, business rivals, <br/>
or other persons engaged in developing or enabling the use of API technologies and services.  <br/>
We request comments on these general conditions for permitted fees and whether <br/>
commenters believe we have created effective guardrails to ensure that fees do not prevent EHI <br/>
from being accessed, exchanged, and used through the use of APIs without special effort.<i> </i><br/>

 <br/>
As noted above, we propose that API Technology Suppliers would be prohibited from <br/>
charging fees associated with API technology unless such fees are expressly permitted. <br/>
Additionally, as a reminder, the scope of “API technology” subject to these proposals would only <br/>
include certified health IT that fulfill the API-focused certification criteria adopted or proposed <br/>
for adoption at 45 CFR 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(11). Thus, all other API functionality provided <br/>
by a health IT developer with its product(s) that have no link to these certified capabilities would <br/>
<b>not</b> be subject to this Condition of Certification.    <br/>
The following proposals outline the specific circumstances in which an API Technology <br/>
Supplier would be permitted to charge fees associated with API technology certified under the <br/>
Program. A fee that satisfies one of the permitted fees in §§ 170.404(a)(3)(ii)-(iv) must also <br/>
satisfy each of the general conditions in § 170.404(a)(3)(i) in order to be permitted and for its <br/>
recovery compliant with this Condition of Certification.<i> </i><br/>
Permitted Fee for Developing, Deploying, and Upgrading API Technology <br/>
 <br/>
In § 170.404(a)(3)(ii), we propose to permit an API Technology Supplier to charge API <br/>
Data Providers reasonable fees for developing, deploying, and upgrading API technology. Fees <br/>
for “developing” API technology comprise the API Technology Supplier’s costs of designing, <br/>
developing, and testing API technology to specifications that fulfill the requirements of the API-<br/>
focused certification criteria adopted or proposed for adoption at 45 CFR 170.315(g)(7) through <br/>
(g)(11). Fees for developing API technology must not include the API Technology Supplier’s <br/>
costs of updating the non-API related capabilities of the API Technology Supplier’s existing <br/>
health IT, including its databases, as part of its development of the API technology. These costs <br/>
would be connected to past business decisions made by the API Technology Supplier and <br/>

 <br/>
typically arise due to health IT being designed or implemented in nonstandard ways that <br/>
unnecessarily increase the complexity, difficulty or burden of accessing, exchanging, or using <br/>
EHI. The recovery of the costs associated with updating an API Technology Supplier’s health IT <br/>
generally would be inconsistent with the Cures Act requirement that API technology be deployed <br/>
“without special effort.” <br/>
The API Technology Supplier’s fees for “deploying” API technology comprise the API <br/>
Technology Supplier’s costs of operationalizing API technology in a production environment. <br/>
Such fees include, but are not limited to, standing up hosting infrastructure, software installation <br/>
and configuration, and the creation and maintenance of API Data Provider administrative <br/>
functions. An API Technology Supplier’s fees for “deploying” API technology does not include <br/>
the costs associated with managing the traffic of API calls that access the API technology, which <br/>
an API Technology Supplier can only recover under the permitted fee for usage support costs <br/>
under § 170.404(a)(3)(iii). For clarity, we reiterate that for the purpose of this Condition of <br/>
Certification, we consider that API technology is “deployed” by the customer—the API Data <br/>
Provider—that purchased or licensed it. <br/>
The API Technology Supplier’s fees for “upgrading” API technology comprise the API <br/>
Technology Supplier’s costs of supplying an API Data Provider with an updated version of API <br/>
technology. Such costs would include the costs required to bring API technology into conformity <br/>
with new requirements of the Program, upgrades to implement general software updates (not <br/>
otherwise covered by development fees or under warranty), or developing and releasing newer <br/>
versions of the API technology at the request of an API Data Provider. <br/>

 <br/>
The nature of the costs that can be charged under this category of permitted fees will <br/>
depend on the scope of the work to be undertaken by an API Technology Supplier (i.e., how <br/>
much or how little labor an API Data Provider requires of the API Technology Supplier to <br/>
deploy and upgrade the API technology being supplied). For example, where an API Data <br/>
Provider decides to fully outsource the deployment of its API technology to its API Technology <br/>
Supplier, the API Technology Supplier’s costs will include the work associated with the <br/>
development of the API technology, the work deploying the API technology, and any work <br/>
upgrading the API technology. <br/>
We propose that any fees that an API Technology Supplier charges for developing, <br/>
deploying, or upgrading API technology must be charged solely to the API Data Provider(s) for <br/>
whom the capabilities are deployed. We propose this limitation because we believe that these <br/>
costs should be negotiated between the API Technology Supplier that supplies the capabilities <br/>
and the API Data Provider (i.e., health care provider) that implements them in its production <br/>
environment. In our view, it is inappropriate to pass these costs on to API Users as doing so <br/>
would impose considerable costs on the API Data Provider’s current or potential partners, such <br/>
as those offering third-party applications and services, as well as the end-users of API <br/>
technology and would amount to the kind of “special effort” that the Cures Act’s API Condition <br/>
of Certification seeks to prevent. <br/>
Subject to the general conditions proposed in § 170.404(a)(3)(i) and discussed above, <br/>
API Technology Suppliers can recover the full range of reasonable costs associated with <br/>
developing, deploying, and upgrading API technology over time. We believe it is important that <br/>
API Technology Suppliers be able to recover these costs and earn a reasonable return on their <br/>

investments so that they have adequate incentives to make continued investments in these <br/>
technologies. In particular, we anticipate that API Technology Suppliers will need to continually <br/>
expand the data elements and upgrade the capabilities associated with Certified APIs as the <br/>
FHIR standard and its implementation specifications mature, and the National Coordinator <br/>
expands the USCDI and ARCH.  <br/>
Permitted Fee to Recover Costs of Supporting API Usage for Purposes Other than Patient <br/>
Access, Exchange, and Use  <br/>
In § 170.404(a)(3)(iii) we propose to permit an API Technology Supplier to charge <br/>
usage-based fees to API Data Providers to the extent that the API technology is used for <br/>
purposes other than facilitating access, exchange, or use of EHI by patients or their applications, <br/>
technologies, or services.  <br/>
We consider “usage-based” fees to be the fees imposed by an API Technology Supplier <br/>
to recover the costs that would typically be incurred supporting API interactions at increasing <br/>
volumes and scale within established service levels. That is, “usage-based” fees recover costs <br/>
incurred by an API Technology Supplier due to the actual use of the API technology once it has <br/>
been deployed (e.g., costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via the <br/>
API technology). We acknowledge that API Technology Suppliers could adopt a range of pricing <br/>
methodologies when charging for the support of API usage. We expect that API usage support <br/>
fees would only come into play when the API Technology Supplier acts on behalf of the API <br/>
Data Provider to deploy its API technology. Thus, the costs recovered under “usage-based” fees <br/>
would only be able to reflect “post-deployment” costs. As such, “usage-based” fees <b>would not</b> <br/>
be allowed to include any costs necessary to prepare and “get the API technology up, running, <br/>

and ready for use,” which are costs that we propose should be recovered as part of the <br/>
deployment services delivered by the API Technology Supplier if permitted under § <br/>
170.404(a)(3)(ii). We believe this Condition of Certification offers the flexibility necessary to <br/>
accommodate reasonable pricing methodologies and will allow API Technology Suppliers to <br/>
explore innovative approaches to recovering the costs associated with supporting API use as a <br/>
permitted fee.  <br/>
As discussed above, we expect that API usage support fees would only come into play <br/>
when the API Technology Supplier acts on behalf of the API Data Provider to deploy its API <br/>
technology. Conversely, in scenarios where the API Data Provider, such as a large hospital <br/>
system, assumes full responsibility for the technical infrastructure necessary to deploy and host <br/>
the API technology it has acquired, the volume and scale of its usage would be the API Data <br/>
Provider’s sole responsibility. As a result, in this scenario and under our proposal’s structure, an <br/>
API Technology Supplier would <b>not</b> be permitted to charge usage-based fees. Instead, the API <br/>
Technology Supplier would be limited to the fees it would be permitted to recover through the <br/>
“development, deployment, upgrade” permitted fee discussed above. <br/>
We reiterate, that “usage-based” fees would need to be settled between an API <br/>
Technology Supplier and API Data Provider. The API Technology Supplier would have no <br/>
standing to go around or through the API Data Provider to issue fees to, for example, a <br/>
population health analytics company engaged by an API Data Provider who accesses the API <br/>
Data Provider’s data via the API technology. <br/>
We propose that any usage-based fees associated with API technology be limited to the <br/>
recovery of the API Technology Supplier’s “incremental costs.” An API Technology Supplier’s <br/>

“incremental costs” comprise the API Technology Supplier’s costs that are directly attributable <br/>
to supporting API interactions at increasing volumes and scale within established service levels. <br/>
We propose than an API Technology Supplier should “price” its costs of supporting access to the <br/>
API technology by reference to the additional costs that the API Technology Supplier would <br/>
incur in supporting certain volumes of API use. In practice, we expect that this means that API <br/>
Technology Suppliers will offer a certain number of “free” API calls based on the fact that, up to <br/>
a certain threshold, the API Technology Supplier will not incur any material costs in supporting <br/>
API technology in addition to the costs recovered for deployment services. However, after this <br/>
threshold is exceeded, we expect that the API Technology Supplier will impose usage-based <br/>
costs commensurate to the additional costs that the API Technology Supplier must incur to <br/>
support API technology use at increasing volumes and scale.  <br/>
We expect that API Technology Suppliers would charge fees that are correlated to the <br/>
incremental ratchetting up of the cost required to meet increased demand. For example, if, at a <br/>
certain volume of API calls, the API Technology Supplier needed to deploy additional server <br/>
capacity, the associated incremental cost of bringing an additional server online could be passed <br/>
on to the API Data Provider because the API technology deployed on behalf of the API Data <br/>
Provider was the subject of the higher usage. Up until the point that the threshold is reached, the <br/>
additional server capacity was not required and so the API Technology Supplier would not be <br/>
permitted to recover the cost associated with it. Moreover, the additional server capacity would <br/>
support ongoing demand up to a certain additional volume, and so the API Technology Supplier <br/>
would not be permitted to recover the costs of further additional server capacity until the then <br/>
current capacity was exhausted. <br/>

 <br/>
Notwithstanding the above, we note that API Technology Suppliers may choose to <br/>
charge for their API usage support services on a “pay as you go” basis, such as a fee-per-call <br/>
pricing structure. This approach could be consistent with the requirement that the API <br/>
Technology Supplier only impose its incremental costs, and the requirements of this Condition of <br/>
Certification more generally. However, depending on the amount being charged, this pricing <br/>
model is open to abuse, with API Data Providers at risk of paying unreasonably high fees if the <br/>
volume of API use is high and when the API Data Provider does not share in the benefits <br/>
enjoyed by the API Technology Supplier when delivering a service at scale. As such, the API <br/>
Technology Supplier would need to be careful to ensure that the total fees paid by an API Data <br/>
Provider were reasonably related to the API Technology Supplier’s costs of supporting the API <br/>
technology. Where the fees paid over a reasonable measuring period were not reasonably related <br/>
to the API Technology Supplier’s costs, they would not be permitted. <br/>
We are also aware that API Technology Suppliers may offer a pricing structure for API <br/>
usage support based on unlimited API calls. That is, the API Technology Supplier may charge a <br/>
flat-fee irrespective of the volume of traffic accessing the API technology. Such a pricing model <br/>
would be allowed under the proposed condition provided that the API Technology Supplier’s fee <br/>
for API usage support was reasonably related to the cost of the services that it had agreed to <br/>
provide. This would mean that the API Technology Supplier would need to make a realistic <br/>
estimate of the volume of API calls that it would need to support to fulfill any service level <br/>
promised, and calculate its fee based on the costs of supporting that call volume. So long as the <br/>
API Technology Supplier made a realistic estimate of the anticipated volume and support level, <br/>

the legitimacy of the API Technology Supplier’s fees, and its ability to recover them as permitted <br/>
fees, would be unaffected by API Users making lower than expected use of API technology. <br/>
In the context of this proposed permitted fee’s scope and the proposed general prohibition <br/>
on fees, we seek to make clear that API Technology Suppliers would be prohibited from <br/>
charging (or including in their contracts and agreements with API Data Providers) any usage-<br/>
based fees for API uses that are associated with the access, exchange, and use of EHI by patients <br/>
or their applications, technologies, or services. This would include, among other things, API calls <br/>
or other transactions initiated by or on behalf of a patient, including third parties (e.g., an <br/>
application or any other technology or service) authorized by the patient or their representative to <br/>
request data on their behalf.  <br/>
Usage fees associated with the access, exchange, and use of EHI by patients is a specific <br/>
example of a prohibited fee that would fit under the general prohibition of a “fee not otherwise <br/>
permitted” and is based on several considerations. First, such fees between an API Technology <br/>
Supplier and API Data Provider would likely be passed on directly to patients, creating a <br/>
significant impediment to their ability to access, exchange, and use their EHI, without special <br/>
effort, through applications and technologies of their choice. More fundamentally, most of the <br/>
information contained in a patient’s electronic record has been documented during the practice of <br/>
medicine or has otherwise been captured in the course of providing health care services to <br/>
patients. In our view, patients have effectively paid for this information, either directly or <br/>
through their employers, health plans, and other entities that negotiate and purchase health care <br/>
items and services on their behalf. Thus, our proposal reflects our belief that it is inappropriate to <br/>
charge patients additional costs to access this information, whether those costs are charged <br/>

 <br/>
directly to patients or passed on as a result of fees charged to persons that provide apps, <br/>
technologies, and services on a patient’s behalf.  <br/>
To be clear, if an API Data Provider sought to employ API technology for the limited <br/>
purpose of making EHI available to patients and their apps, the API Data Provider’s API <br/>
Technology Supplier would have no legitimate basis to charge the API Data Provider, or any <br/>
other person, for the “patient access” usage-based costs associated with the API technology. <br/>
Any unreasonable fees associated with a patient’s access to their EHI may be suspect <br/>
under the information blocking provision. Such fees may also be inconsistent with an <br/>
individual’s right of access to their PHI under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164.524). )  <br/>
In addition to our proposal in § 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(A) and detailed above that this <br/>
permitted fee would not include any costs incurred by the API Technology Supplier to support <br/>
uses of the API technology that facilitate a patient’s ability to access, exchange, or use their <br/>
electronic health information, we also propose to explicitly exclude two additional costs from <br/>
this permitted fee. In § 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(B), we propose that this permitted fee would not <br/>
include costs associated with intangible assets (including depreciation or loss of value), except <br/>
the actual development or acquisition costs of such assets. For instance, an API Technology <br/>
Supplier could not charge an API Data Provider a fee based on the purported “cost” of allowing <br/>
the API Data Provider to use the API Technology Supplier’s patented API technology. As <br/>
discussed in more detail in section VIII.D.4 (Information Blocking), we believe it would be <br/>
inappropriate to permit an actor to charge a fee based on these considerations, which are <br/>
inherently subjective and could invite the kinds of rent-seeking and opportunistic pricing <br/>
practices that create barriers to access, use, and exchange of EHI and impede interoperability. <br/>

In § 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(C), we propose that this permitted fee would not include <br/>
opportunity costs, except for the reasonable forward-looking cost of capital. These speculative <br/>
costs could include revenues that an API Technology Supplier could have earned had it not <br/>
provided the API technology. We clarify that the exclusion of opportunity costs would not <br/>
preclude an API Technology Supplier from recovering its reasonable forward-looking cost of <br/>
capital. We believe these costs are relatively concrete and that permitting their recovery will <br/>
protect incentives for API Technology Suppliers to invest in developing and providing <br/>
interoperability elements (as described in section VIII.D.4).  <br/>
Permitted Fee for Value-added Services <br/>
 <br/>
In § 170.404(a)(3)(iv) we propose to permit an API Technology Supplier to charge fees <br/>
to API Users<a href="ONCs.html#259">92</a> for value-added services supplied in connection with software that can interact <br/>
with the API technology. These “value-added services” would need to be provided in connection <br/>
with and supplemental to the development, testing, and deployment of software applications that <br/>
interact with API technology. Critically, fees would not be permitted if they interfere with an <br/>
API User’s ability to efficiently and effectively develop and deploy production-ready software. <br/>
This means that in order to be permitted, an API User could not be required to incur the fee in <br/>
order to develop and deploy a production-ready software application that interacts with the API <br/>
technology acquired by the API Data Provider. Rather, a fee will only be permitted if it relates to <br/>
a service that a software developer can elect to purchase, but is not required to purchase in order <br/>
to develop and deploy production-ready apps. <br/>
                                                 <br/>
92 In this context a health care provider, which could otherwise be an “API Data Provider” in one context, may <br/>equally be an API User in a different context. Given this potential dual role for health care providers, we have <br/>focused on API Users as the party to whom a fee may be charged for the purposes of this permitted fee. <br/>

We believe it appropriate to permit this type of fee because API Technology Suppliers <br/>
may offer a wide-range of market differentiating services to make it attractive for API Users to <br/>
develop software applications that can interact with the API technology supplied by an API <br/>
Technology Supplier. Such services could include advanced training, premium development <br/>
tools and distribution channels, and enhanced compatibility/integration testing assessments. For <br/>
example, an API Technology Supplier would be permitted to charge fees for value-added <br/>
services that would be associated with but go beyond the scope set by the (g)(10)-certified API, <br/>
such as write access, co-branded integration into the API Technology Supplier’s product(s) <br/>
workflow, co-marketing arrangements, and promoted placement in an API Technology <br/>
Supplier’s app store. That said, we caution API Technology Suppliers that value-added services <br/>
would have to be made available in a manner that complies with other requirements of this <br/>
Condition of Certification and with the information blocking provision.   <br/>
To illustrate the scope of the fees permitted under this proposal, we clarify that the <br/>
permitted value-added services fee would enable an API Technology Supplier to recover certain <br/>
costs associated with operating an “app store.” However, those fees cannot interfere with an API <br/>
User’s ability to efficiently and effectively develop and deploy production-ready apps without <br/>
special effort. We are aware that API Technology Suppliers offer services associated with the <br/>
listing and promotion of apps beyond basic app placement. Such fees would be permitted, so <br/>
long as the API Technology Supplier ensured that basic access and listing in the app store was <br/>
provided free of charge if an app developer depended on such listing to efficiently and <br/>
effectively develop and deploy production-ready apps without special effort. Fees charged for <br/>
additional/specialized technical support or promotion of the API User’s app beyond these basic <br/>

access and listing services would also be permitted. In contrast, if an API Technology Supplier <br/>
required, for example, a software developer’s app to go through a paid listing process as a <br/>
dependency/precondition to be able to be deployed (and generally accessible) to the API <br/>
Technology Supplier’s health care provider customers to use, this would not be a permitted fee <br/>
under this Condition of Certification, would constitute special effort, and could raise information <br/>
blocking concerns.  <br/>
Prohibited Fees <br/>
As discussed above, we proposed that any API-related fee imposed by an API <br/>
Technology Supplier that is not expressly permitted is prohibited. This approach is necessary <br/>
because, as discussed in section VIII.C.5.c of this proposed rule, we continue to receive evidence <br/>
that some health IT developers are engaging in practices that create special effort when it comes <br/>
to API technology. These practices include fees that create barriers to entry or competition as <br/>
well as rent-seeking and other opportunistic behaviors. For example, some health IT developers <br/>
are conditioning access to technical interoperability documentation on revenue-sharing or royalty <br/>
agreements that bear no plausible relation to the costs incurred by the health IT developer to <br/>
provide or enable its use. We are also aware of discriminatory pricing policies that have the <br/>
purpose or effect of excluding competitors from the use of APIs and other interoperability <br/>
elements. These practices close off the market to innovative applications and services that could <br/>
empower patients and enable providers to deliver greater value and choice to health care <br/>
consumers and additional service providers. <br/>
 <br/>
To address these concerns we provide the following non-exhaustive examples of fees for <br/>
services that API Technology Suppliers <b>would be</b> <b>prohibited </b>from charging: <br/>

revisions or alternative approaches. We encourage detailed comments that include, where <br/>
possible, economic justifications for suggested revisions or alternative approaches. <br/>
<i>Record-keeping requirements</i> <br/>
 <br/>
To provide appropriate accountability, we propose in § 170.404(a)(3)(v) that API <br/>
Technology Suppliers must keep for inspection detailed records of all fees charged with respect <br/>
to API technology and all costs that it claims to have incurred to provide API technology to API <br/>
Data Providers. To provide assurance that the API Technology Supplier’s fees are reasonably <br/>
related to the API Technology Supplier’s costs, the API Technology Supplier would need to <br/>
document, with the same level of detail, any fees charged and associated costs incurred to <br/>
provide other services to which any portion of the costs could reasonably be attributed. For <br/>
example, if the API Technology Supplier charges a fee that reflects its costs for internet servers <br/>
used to provide the API technology, the API Technology Supplier would need to document the <br/>
costs of any other internet-based services it provides, as well as any other purposes for which the <br/>
internet servers are used.  <br/>
 <br/>
Separately, an API Technology Supplier would need to document the criteria it used to <br/>
allocate any costs across relevant customers, requestors, or other persons. The criteria must be <br/>
documented in a level of detail that would enable determination as to whether the API <br/>
Technology Supplier’s cost allocations are objectively reasonable and comply with the cost <br/>
accountability requirements, including whether fees reflect the API Technology Supplier’s actual <br/>

costs reasonably incurred, were allocated reasonably and between only those API Data Providers <br/>
that either cause the costs to be incurred or benefit from the associated supply or support of the <br/>
API technology, and were distributed across customers and other relevant persons in a <br/>
permissible manner, as described above.  <br/>
 <br/>
We note that an API Technology Supplier must retain its accounting records consistent <br/>
with the retention requirement proposed for adoption as part of the Assurances Condition of <br/>
Certification (proposed for adoption in § 170.402). In the event that a potential violation of this <br/>
Condition and Maintenance of Certification creates a conformance fact-finding scenario by ONC <br/>
or information blocking is investigated, we believe that this period of time would provide ONC <br/>
with appropriate visibility into the API Technology Supplier’s business practices. <br/>
 <br/>
We request comment on whether these requirements provide adequate traceability and <br/>
accountability for costs permitted under this API Condition of Certification. We also seek <br/>
comment on whether to require more detailed accounting records or to prescribe specific <br/>
accounting standards.  <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
iv. Openness and Pro-competitive Conditions <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that API Technology Suppliers would have to comply with certain <br/>
requirements to promote an open and competitive marketplace. As a general condition, we <br/>
propose in § 170.404(a)(4) that API Technology Suppliers must grant API Data Providers (i.e., <br/>
health care providers who purchase or license API technology) the sole authority and autonomy <br/>
to permit API Users to interact with the API technology deployed by the API Data Provider. We <br/>
reinforce this general condition through more specific proposed conditions proposals discussed <br/>
below that would require API Technology Suppliers to provide equitable access to API <br/>

technology, which would include granting the rights and providing the cooperation necessary to <br/>
enable apps to be deployed that use the API technology to access, exchange, and use EHI in <br/>
production environments.  <br/>
 <br/>
As important context for these proposals, we note that the API technology required by <br/>
this Condition of Certification falls squarely within the concept of “essential interoperability <br/>
elements” described in section VIII.C.4.b of this preamble and, as such, are subject to strict <br/>
protections under the information blocking provision. As a corollary, to the extent that API <br/>
Technology Suppliers claim an intellectual property right or other proprietary interest in the API <br/>
technology, they must take care not to impose any fees, require any license terms, or engage in <br/>
any other practices that could add unnecessary cost, difficulty, or other burden that could impede <br/>
the effective use of the API technology for the purpose of enabling or facilitating access, <br/>
exchange, or use of EHI. Moreover, even apart from these information blocking considerations, <br/>
we believe that, as developers of technology certified under the Program, API Technology <br/>
Suppliers owe a special responsibility to patients, providers, and other stakeholders to make API <br/>
technology available in a manner that is truly “open” and minimizes any costs or other burdens <br/>
that could result in special effort. The proposed conditions set forth below are intended to <br/>
provide clear rules and expectations for API Technology Suppliers so that they can meet these <br/>
obligations.  <br/>
<i>Non-Discrimination</i>  <br/>
 <br/>
We propose in § 170.404(a)(4)(i) that an API Technology Supplier must adhere to a <br/>
strictly non-discriminatory policy regarding the provision of API technology. As a starting point, <br/>
we propose to require in § 170.404(a)(4)(i)(A) that API Technology Suppliers comply with all of <br/>

 <br/>
the requirements discussed in section VIII.C.4.b of this proposed rule regarding the non-<br/>
discriminatory provision of interoperability elements. Accordingly, and consistent with <br/>
developers’ obligations under the Program and our expectation that API technology be truly <br/>
“open,” we propose to require that API Technology Suppliers must provide API technology to <br/>
API Data Providers on terms that are no less favorable than they would provide to themselves <br/>
and their customers, suppliers, partners, and other persons with whom they have a business <br/>
relationship. This requirement would apply to both price and non-price terms and thus would <br/>
apply to any fees that the API Technology Supplier is permitted to charge under the “permitted <br/>
charges conditions” of this Condition of Certification. We believe this requirement would ensure <br/>
that API Data Providers (i.e., health care providers) who purchase or license API technology <br/>
have sole authority and autonomy to permit third-party software developers to connect to and use <br/>
the API technology they have acquired.  <br/>
Next, we propose in § 170.404(a)(4)(i)(B) that any terms and conditions associated with <br/>
API technology would have to be based on objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly <br/>
applied for all substantially similar or similarly situated classes of persons and requests. For <br/>
example, if the API Technology Supplier applied an “app store” entry/listing process unequally <br/>
and added arbitrary criteria based on the use case(s) an app was focused on, such business <br/>
practices would not comply with this specific condition and could also be in violation of the <br/>
information blocking provision. <br/>
Moreover, we propose in § 170.404(a)(4)(i)(C) that an API Technology Supplier would <br/>
be prohibited from offering or varying such terms or conditions on the basis of impermissible <br/>
criteria, such as whether the API User with whom the API Data Provider has a relationship is a <br/>

competitor, potential competitor, or will be using EHI obtained via the API technology in a way <br/>
that facilitates competition with the API Technology Supplier. The API Technology Supplier <br/>
would also be prohibited from taking into consideration the revenue or other value the API User <br/>
with whom the API Data Provider has a relationship may derive from access, exchange, or use of <br/>
EHI obtained by means of the API technology. We believe these proposals will help promote <br/>
greater equity and competition in market as well as prevent discriminatory business practices by <br/>
API Technology Suppliers.    <br/>
 <br/>
<i>Rights to Access and Use API Technology</i> <br/>
 <br/>
We propose in § 170.404(a)(4)(ii)(A) that an API Technology Supplier would have to <br/>
make API technology available in a manner that enables API Data Providers and API Users to <br/>
develop and deploy apps to access, exchange, and use EHI in production environments. To this <br/>
end, we propose that an API Technology Supplier must have and, upon request, must grant to <br/>
API Data Providers and their API Users all rights that may be reasonably necessary to access and <br/>
use API technology in a production environment. In other words, this proposal is focused on the <br/>
provision of rights reasonably necessary to access and use API technology and does not extend <br/>
to other intellectual property maintained by the API Technology Supplier, especially intellectual <br/>
property that has no nexus with the access and use of API technology. In situations where such a <br/>
nexus exists, even partially, the API Technology Supplier would have the duty to determine a <br/>
method to grant the applicable rights reasonably necessary to access and use the API technology. <br/>
And if practicable, under these partial cases, we note that it would be possible for the API <br/>
Technology Supplier to exclude the intellectual property that would have no impact on the access <br/>
and use of the API technology.  <br/>

 <br/>
Accordingly, following our proposal, API Technology Suppliers would need to grant API <br/>
Data Providers and their API Users with rights that could include but not be limited to the <br/>
following in order to sufficiently support the use of the API technology:  <br/>
•  For the purposes of developing products or services that are designed to be interoperable with <br/>
the API Technology Supplier’s health IT or with health IT under the API Technology <br/>
Supplier’s control.  <br/>
•  Any marketing, offering, and distribution of interoperable products and services to potential <br/>
customers and users that would be needed for the API technology to be used in a production <br/>
environment. Note, API Technology Suppliers, pursuant to the “value-added services” <br/>
permitted fee, would be able to offer and charge for services such as preferential marketing <br/>
agreements, co-marketing agreements, and other business arrangements so long as such <br/>
services are beyond what is necessary for the API technology to be put into use in a <br/>
production environment.   <br/>
•  Enabling the use of the interoperable products or services in production environments, <br/>
including accessing and enabling the exchange and use of electronic health information.  <br/>
 <br/>
Relatedly, in § 170.404(a)(4)(ii)(B) we propose to prohibit an API Technology Supplier <br/>
from imposing any collateral terms or agreements that could interfere with or lead to special <br/>
effort in the use of API technology for any of the above purposes. We note that these collateral <br/>
terms or agreements may also implicate the information blocking provision for the reasons <br/>
described in section VIII.D.3.c of this preamble. These specific proposed conditions would <br/>
expressly prohibit an API Technology Supplier from conditioning any of the rights described <br/>
above on the requirement that the recipient of the rights do, or agree to do, any of the following: <br/>

•  Pay a fee to license the rights described above, including but not limited to a license fee, <br/>
royalty, or revenue-sharing arrangement.  <br/>
•  Not compete with the API Technology Supplier in any product, service, or market. <br/>
•  Deal exclusively with the API Technology Supplier in any product, service, or market. <br/>
•  Obtain additional licenses, products, or services that are not related to or can be unbundled <br/>
from the API technology.  <br/>
•  License, grant, assign, or transfer any intellectual property to the API Technology Supplier. <br/>
•  Meet additional developer or product certification requirements. <br/>
•  Provide the API Technology Supplier or its technology with reciprocal access to application <br/>
data.  <br/>
 <br/>
These prohibitions largely mirror those proposed under the exception to the information <br/>
blocking definition in § 171.206 and reflect the same concerns expressed in that context in <br/>
section VIII.D.3.c of this preamble. However, we note the following important distinction: <br/>
Whereas proposed § 171.206 would permit a developer to charge a reasonable royalty to license <br/>
interoperability elements, this API Condition of Certification would not permit any such royalty, <br/>
license fee, or other type of fee of any kind whatsoever pursuant to the general fee prohibition <br/>
proposed in the “permitted charges condition.” This additional limitation reflects the more <br/>
exacting standards that apply to API Technology Suppliers with respect to the provision of API <br/>
technology under this Condition of Certification. While we believe that, for the reasons <br/>
described in section VIII.D.3.c of this preamble, health IT developers should generally be <br/>
permitted to charge reasonable royalties for the use of their intellectual property, we consider <br/>
API technology to be a special case. Certified health IT developers (i.e., API Technology <br/>

 <br/>
Suppliers) are required to provide these capabilities as part of their statutory duty to facilitate the <br/>
access, exchange, and use of patient health information from EHRs “without special effort.” We <br/>
believe the language requiring that these capabilities be “open” precludes an API Technology <br/>
Supplier from conditioning access to API technology on the payment of a royalty or other fee, <br/>
however “reasonable” the fee might otherwise be.  <br/>
 <br/>
We clarify that the prohibitions explained above against additional developer or Health <br/>
IT Module certification requirements and, separately, against requirements for reciprocal access <br/>
to application data, are within the scope of the collateral terms prohibited by proposed § 171.206 <br/>
even though these additional API Technology Supplier requirements are not explicitly referenced <br/>
by that exception because they are not generally applicable to all types of interoperability <br/>
elements. Nevertheless, permitting an API Technology Supplier to impose these kinds of <br/>
additional requirements would be inconsistent with the Cures Act’s expectation that API <br/>
technology be made available openly and in a manner that promotes competition. For the same <br/>
reason such practices may raise information blocking concerns.  <br/>
 <br/>
<i>API Technology Suppliers – Additional Obligations</i> <br/>
 <br/>
To support the use of API technology in production environments, we propose in § <br/>
170.404(a)(4)(iii) that an API Technology Supplier must provide all support and other services <br/>
that are reasonably necessary to enable the effective development, deployment, and use of API <br/>
technology by API Data Providers and its API Users in production environments. In general, the <br/>
precise nature of these obligations will depend on the specifics of the API Technology Supplier’s <br/>
technology and the manner in which it is implemented and made available for specific <br/>
customers. Therefore, with the following exceptions, we do not delineate the API Technology <br/>

 <br/>
Supplier’s specific support obligations and instead propose a general requirement to this effect in <br/>
§ 170.404(a)(4)(iii).  <br/>
Changes and Updates to API Technology and Terms and Conditions <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to require in § 170.404(a)(4)(iii)(A) that API Technology Suppliers must <br/>
make reasonable efforts to maintain the compatibility of the API technology they develop and <br/>
assist API Data Providers to deploy in order to avoid disrupting the use of API technology. <br/>
Similarly, we propose in § 170.404(a)(4)(iii)(B) that prior to making changes or updates to its <br/>
API technology or to the terms or conditions thereof, an API Technology Supplier would need to <br/>
provide notice and a reasonable opportunity for its API Data Provider customers and registered <br/>
application developers to update their applications to preserve compatibility with its API <br/>
technology or to comply with any revised terms or conditions. Without this opportunity, clinical <br/>
and patient applications could be rendered inoperable or operate in unexpected ways <br/>
unbeknownst to the users or software developers.  <br/>
Further, we note that this proposal aligns with the exception to the information blocking <br/>
definition proposed in § 171.206. As explained in section VIII.D.3.c of this preamble, the <br/>
information blocking definition would be implicated were an API Technology Supplier to make <br/>
changes to its API technology that “break” compatibility or otherwise degrade the performance <br/>
or interoperability of the licensee’s products or services that incorporate the licensed API <br/>
technology. We propose these additional safeguards are important in light of the ease with which <br/>
an API Technology Supplier could make subtle “tweaks” to its technology or related services, <br/>
which could disrupt the use of the licensee’s compatible technologies or services and result in <br/>
substantial competitive and consumer injury.  <br/>

 <br/>
We clarify that this requirement would in no way prevent an API Technology Supplier <br/>
from making improvements to its technology or responding to the needs of its own customers or <br/>
users. However, the API Technology Supplier would need to demonstrate that whatever actions <br/>
it took were necessary to accomplish these purposes and that it afforded the licensee a reasonable <br/>
opportunity under the circumstances to update its technology to maintain interoperability. <br/>
Relatedly, we recognize that an API Technology Supplier may have to suspend access or make <br/>
other changes immediately and without prior notice in response to legitimate privacy, security, or <br/>
patient safety-related exigencies. Such practices would be permitted by this Condition of <br/>
Certification provided they are tailored and do not unnecessarily interfere with the use of API <br/>
technology. From an information blocking standpoint, if such practices interfered with access, <br/>
exchange, or use of EHI, the API Technology Supplier could seek coverage under the exceptions <br/>
to the information blocking provision described in section VIII.D of this preamble. For instance, <br/>
if the suspended access was in response to a privacy exigency, the API Technology Supplier may <br/>
be able to seek coverage under the exception for promoting the privacy of EHI at proposed § <br/>
171.202. <br/>
e. Maintenance of Certification Requirements <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to adopt Maintenance requirements for this Condition of Certification. These <br/>
maintenance requirements would be duties that we believe the Cures Act expected API <br/>
Technology Suppliers (i.e., health IT developers) would need to comply with in the course of <br/>
maintaining their Health IT Module(s)’ certification.  <br/>

 <br/>
In the specific context of application registration, we wish to underscore that to provide a <br/>
frictionless experience for developers of these applications and individuals that use them, an API <br/>
Technology Supplier would be required to provide all services and other support necessary to <br/>
ensure that such apps can be deployed and used in production without any additional assistance <br/>
or intervention by the API Technology Supplier. For this reason, we propose in § 170.404(b)(1) a <br/>
specific requirement for API Technology Suppliers that they would need to “register” (in <br/>
connection with the API technology functionality proposed in § 170.315(g)(10)(iii)) and enable <br/>
all applications for production use within one business day of completing its verification of an <br/>
application developer’s authenticity as described in proposed § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(C). We propose <br/>
this explicit requirement is necessary in order to ensure that a patient’s ability to use an app of <br/>
their choice is not artificially or intentionally slowed by an API Technology Supplier, causing <br/>
special effort on the part of the patient to gain access to their EHI. We also emphasize that this is <br/>
specific duty for API Technology Suppliers in the course of maintaining the Health IT <br/>
Module(s)’ certificate to which their API technology is associated. In instances where an API <br/>
Technology Supplier chooses not to perform app developer verification processes described in <br/>
proposed § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(C), it would need to solely meet this one business day requirement <br/>
from the point of having received a request for registration. <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
ii. Publication of FHIR Endpoints <br/>
 <br/>
In order to interact with a FHIR RESTful API, an app needs to know the “FHIR Service <br/>
Base URL,” which is often referred to colloquially as a “FHIR server’s endpoint.”<a href="ONCs.html#273">93 </a>The public <br/>

 <br/>
FHIR-based APIs without special effort, especially for patient access apps. Accordingly, we <br/>
propose to adopt in § 170.404(b)(2) a specific requirement that an API Technology Supplier <br/>
must support the publication of Service Base URLs for all of its customers, regardless of those <br/>
that are centrally managed by the API Technology Supplier or locally deployed, and make such <br/>
information publicly available (in a computable format) at no charge. In instances where an API <br/>
Technology Supplier is contracted by an API Data Provider to manage its FHIR server, we <br/>
expect that this administrative duty will be relatively easy to manage. In instances where an API <br/>
Data Provider assumes full responsibility to “locally manage” its FHIR server, the API <br/>
Technology Supplier would be required, pursuant to this proposed maintenance requirement, to <br/>
obtain this information from its customers. We strongly encourage API Technology Suppliers, <br/>
health care providers, HINs and patient advocacy organizations to coalesce around the <br/>
development of a public resource or service from which all stakeholders could benefit. We <br/>
believe this would help scale and enhance the ease with which Service Base URLs could be <br/>
obtained and used.  <br/>

 <br/>
iii. Providing (g)(10)-Certified APIs to API Data Providers <br/>
We propose in § 170.404(b)(3) that an API Technology Supplier with API technology <br/>
previously certified to the certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(8) must provide all API Data <br/>
Providers with such API technology deployed with API technology certified to the certification <br/>
criterion in § 170.315(g)(10) within 24 months of this final rule’s effective date. We believe this <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirement will permit ONC to monitor and facilitate the rollout to <br/>
health care providers of this important functionality. This is of particular relevance as we <br/>
propose below to include this functionality in the 2015 Base EHR definition in place of the <br/>

current “application access – data category request” certification criterion (§ 170.315(g)(8)), <br/>
which means health care providers will need this functionality to meet the Certified EHR <br/>
Technology (CEHRT) for associated Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) <br/>
programs. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
f. 2015 Edition Base EHR Definition  <br/>
 <br/>
As described in detail above, we have propose to adopt a new certification criterion in § <br/>
170.315(g)(10) that would replace the current criterion adopted in § 170.315(g)(8) and as <br/>
referenced in the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition expressed in § 170.102. This change is <br/>
necessary to fully implement the Cures Act and ensure that API Technology Suppliers have the <br/>
requisite incentive to deploy standardized APIs that can be used “without special effort” and API <br/>
Data Providers have added incentive to adopt such functionality. As result, we propose to create <br/>
a phase-in for the proposed API certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(10) from the issuance of a <br/>
subsequent final rule. This phase-in period includes separate and sequential time for API <br/>
Technology Suppliers and API Data Providers.  <br/>
Consistent with our proposed compliance timing for the certification criterion proposed <br/>
for adoption in § 170.315(b)(10), we propose to add compliance timeline language to the 2015 <br/>
Edition Base EHR definition for the transition from § 170.315(g)(8) to § 170.315(g)(10) that <br/>
would reflect a total of 24 months from the final rule’s effective date (which practically speaking <br/>
would be 25 months because of the 30-day delayed effective date). We believe this approach is <br/>
best because it identifies a single, specific date for both API Technology Suppliers and API Data <br/>
Providers by which upgraded API technology needs to be deployed in production. We also <br/>
believe that 24 months is sufficient for this upgrade because the scope and nature of our <br/>

 <br/>
proposals intersect and reflect a large portion of capabilities API Technology Suppliers have <br/>
already developed and deployed to meet § 170.315(g)(8). Moreover, this single date enables API <br/>
Technology Suppliers (based on their client base and IT architecture) to determine the most <br/>
appropriate timeline for development, testing, certification, and product release cycles in <br/>
comparison to having to meet an arbitrary “must be certified by this date” requirement.  <br/>
5. Real World Testing <br/>
 <br/>
The Cures Act requires, as a Condition and Maintenance of Certification under the <br/>
Program, that health IT developers have successfully tested the real world use of the technology <br/>
for interoperability in the type of setting in which such technology would be marketed. The <br/>
Cures Act defines interoperability as “health information technology that enables the secure <br/>

complete access, exchange, and use of all electronically accessible health information for <br/>
authorized use under applicable state or federal law; and does not constitute information <br/>
blocking as also defined by the Cures Act.”<a href="ONCs.html#276">94 </a>We propose to codify this interoperability <br/>

The Program issues, and will continue to issue under our real world testing approach, <br/>
certifications to health IT through a process whereby health IT is assessed against the testing <br/>
requirements established by ONC. Often, this means health IT is tested by an ONC-ATL in a <br/>
laboratory environment through methods that include a testing proctor’s visual inspection of <br/>

functions, review of developer-provided documentation of functions, and testing tools with <br/>
simulation test data. An ONC-ACB evaluates the results of testing and makes a determination, <br/>
based on these test results and an assessment of compliance with other Program requirements, to <br/>
issue the health IT a certificate. Over the course of the Program’s existence, ONC has <br/>
emphasized the continued conformance of certified health IT products post-certification in real <br/>
world and clinical settings. For example, ONC expanded the responsibilities of ONC-ACBs in <br/>
the 2015 Edition final rule to require that they perform in-the-field surveillance. We did this to <br/>
affirm the Program’s long-standing expectations that certified health IT continue to operate in <br/>
accordance with certification requirements when implemented in the field (80 FR 62707-62719). <br/>
These efforts are also in line with the Cures Act’s real world testing Condition of Certification <br/>
through their focus on system interoperability and exchange of information as deployed and used <br/>
in care environments—that is to say, in the “real world.” <br/>
 <br/>
The objective of real world testing is to verify the extent to which certified health IT <br/>
deployed in operational production settings is demonstrating continued compliance to <br/>
certification criteria and functioning with the intended use cases as part of the overall <br/>
maintenance of a health IT’s certification. Real world testing should ensure certified health IT <br/>
has the ability to share electronic health information with other systems. Real world testing <br/>
should assess that the certified health IT is meeting the intended use case(s) of the certification <br/>
criteria to which it is certified within the workflow, health IT architecture, and care/practice <br/>
setting in which the health IT is implemented. Accordingly, we propose that successful real <br/>
world testing means for the purpose of this Condition of Certification that: <br/>

•  The certified health IT continues to be compliant to the certification criteria to which it is <br/>
certified, including the required technical standards and vocabulary codes sets; <br/>
•  The certified health IT is exchanging electronic health information in the care and practice <br/>
settings for which it is intended for use; and <br/>
•  Electronic health information is received by and used in the certified health IT. <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to limit the applicability of this Condition of Certification to health IT <br/>
developers with Health IT Modules certified to one or more 2015 Edition certification criteria <br/>
focused on interoperability and data exchange, which are: <br/>
•  The care coordination criteria in § 170.315(b); <br/>
•  The clinical quality measures (CQMs) criteria in § 170.315(c)(1) through (c)(3); <br/>
•  The “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” criterion in § 170.315(e)(1); <br/>
•  The public health criteria in § 170.315(f); <br/>
•  The application programming interface criteria in § 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(11); and <br/>
•  The transport methods and other protocols criteria in § 170.315(h). <br/>
 <br/>
The 2015 Edition certification criteria that are not included in the proposed list include <br/>
many functionality-based criteria, administrative criteria, and, overall, criteria that do not focus <br/>
on interoperability <i>and</i> exchange of data. In particular, we do not propose to include the 2015 <br/>
Edition paragraph (a) “clinical” certification criteria in this list because they do not focus on <br/>
interoperability and exchange of data. However, the data in the paragraph (a) criteria largely will <br/>
be covered through the USCDI as a minimum data set expected for exchange; the USCDI is <br/>
included in such criteria as “transitions of care” (§ 170.315(b)(1)), “view, download, and <br/>
transmit to 3rd party” (§ 170.315(e)(1)), and the API criteria (i.e., § 170.315(g)(9) and (10)).  <br/>

We solicit comment on whether to include the “patient health information capture” <br/>
certification criteria in § 170.315(e)(3), including the value of real world testing these <br/>
functionalities compared to the benefit for interoperability and exchange. We also solicit <br/>
comment on whether any other 2015 Edition certification criteria should be included or removed <br/>
from the applicability list for this Condition of Certification.  <br/>
 <br/>
To fully implement the real world testing Condition of Certification as described above, <br/>
we propose Maintenance of Certification requirements that would require health IT developers to <br/>
submit publicly available prospective annual real world testing plans and retrospective annual <br/>
real world testing results for its certified health IT that include certification criteria focused on <br/>
interoperability. As we considered the various approaches to implement this Cures Act <br/>
requirement on health IT developers, we determined that health IT developers would be best <br/>
positioned to construct how their certified health IT could be tested in the real world. Moreover, <br/>
by requiring health IT developers to be responsible for facilitating their certified health IT testing <br/>
in production settings and being held accountable to publicly publish their results, we would <br/>
balance the respective burden of this statutory requirement with its intended assurances for <br/>
health care providers. Additionally, ONC is not adequately resourced to centrally administer a <br/>
real world testing regime among each health IT developer and its customers, nor do we have the <br/>
specific relationships with health care providers that health IT developers do. Lastly, even if <br/>
ONC were positioned to support and scale a real world testing regime, we would run the risk of <br/>
having one-size-fits-all tools that would not necessarily get to the level of detail and granularity <br/>
necessary and reflective of different health care settings and different scopes of practice that use <br/>
certified health IT. <br/>

Given these considerations, we propose that a health IT developer must submit an annual <br/>
real world testing plan to its ONC-ACB via a publicly accessible hyperlink no later than <br/>
December 15, of each calendar year for each of its certified 2015 Edition Health IT Modules that <br/>
include certification criteria specified for this Condition of Certification. Prior to submission to <br/>
the ONC-ACB, the plan would need to be approved by a health IT developer authorized <br/>
representative capable of binding the health IT developer for execution of the plan and include <br/>
the representative’s contact information. The plan would need to include all health IT certified to <br/>
the 2015 Edition through August 31 of the preceding year. The plan would also need to address <br/>
the health IT developer’s real world testing for the upcoming calendar year and include, for each <br/>
of the certification criteria in scope: <br/>
•  The testing method(s)/methodology(ies) that will be used to demonstrate real world <br/>
interoperability, including a mandatory focus on scenario- and use case-focused testing; <br/>
•  The care and practice setting(s) that will be tested for real world interoperability, including <br/>
conformance to certification criteria requirements, and an explanation for the health IT <br/>
developer’s choice of care setting(s) to test;<a href="ONCs.html#280">95 </a><br/>
•  The timeline and plans for voluntary updates to standards and implementation specifications <br/>
that ONC has approved (further discussed below); <br/>
•  A schedule of key real world testing milestones; <br/>
•  A description of the expected outcomes of real world testing;  <br/>
                                                 <br/>

As an example, health IT developers can consider categories, including but not limited to, those used in <br/>the EHR Incentive Programs<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/October2017_MedicareEHRIncentivePayments.pdf"> (https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-<br/>Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/October2017_MedicareEHRIncentivePayments.pdf)</a>; <br/>long-term and post-acute care; pediatrics; behavioral health; and small, rural, and underserved settings. <br/>

•  At least one measurement/metric associated with the real world testing; and <br/>
•  A justification for the health IT developer’s real world testing approach. <br/>
The intended testing methods/methodologies would need to address testing scenarios, use <br/>
cases, and workflows associated with interoperability. Testing may occur in the operational <br/>
setting using real patient data, in an environment that mirrors the clinical setting using synthetic <br/>
or real patient data, or in the clinical setting with synthetic data intermixed. Note that when <br/>
Health IT developers who are HIPAA business associates are conducting testing using ePHI, <br/>
such testing must be conducted consistent with their business associate agreements and other <br/>
compliance responsibilities. The health IT developer may also partner with other health IT <br/>
developers to perform real world testing. We would expect developers to consider such factors as <br/>
the size of the organization that production systems support, the type of organization and setting, <br/>
the number of patient records and users, system components and integrations, and the volume <br/>
and types of data exchange in planning for real world testing. We would also expect developers <br/>
to explain how they will incorporate voluntary standards updates in their real world testing as <br/>
discussed further below. While we are not proposing a minimum proportion of the customer base <br/>
that must be covered in real world testing, we highly encourage developers to find ways to <br/>
ensure, to the extent practical, proportionate coverage of their customer base that balances the <br/>
goals of real world testing with burden to providers. Health IT developers would not be required <br/>
to test the certified health IT in each and every setting in which it is intended for use as this <br/>
would likely not be feasible due to the associated burden; however, developers must address <br/>
their choice of care and/or practice settings to test and ONC encourages developers test in as <br/>
many settings as feasible. Additionally, health IT developers would be required to provide a <br/>

justification for their chosen approach. Because our approach provides great flexibility for health <br/>
IT developers with respect to demonstrating compliance, we believe it is imperative that they <br/>
provide a justification to explain their methodology. Through the transparent reporting of their <br/>
real world testing plans, the public will have an opportunity to consider a health IT developer’s <br/>
chosen approach(es) and whether it is sufficiently comprehensive to provide assurance that the <br/>
certified health IT has satisfactorily demonstrated its satisfaction of Program requirements <br/>
including interoperability in real world settings relevant to their needs. <br/>
 <br/>
Health IT developers should consider existing testing tools and approaches that may be <br/>
used to assess real world interoperability. For example, we encourage health IT developers to <br/>
consider metrics of use and exchange from existing networks, communities, and tools including, <br/>
but not limited to, Surescripts, Carequality, CommonWell Health Alliance, the C-CDA One-<br/>
Click Scorecard, and DirectTrust. We do not believe that testing through the ONC-approved test <br/>
procedures is sufficient to demonstrate real world use as the test procedures developed for initial <br/>
laboratory testing and certification are generally setting agnostic, focused on standards <br/>
conformance, and do not always test the full scope of the certification criteria’s intended <br/>
functionality. We also clarify that the ONC-approved test procedures are not intended for use in <br/>
in-the-field surveillance or for real world testing. Further, we do not believe connect-a-thons are <br/>
a valid approach to testing real world use of health IT because they do not necessarily assess <br/>
interoperability and functionality in live settings, but rather test developer/vendor connectivity in <br/>
a closed test environment. Health IT developers may consider working with an ONC-ACB to <br/>
have the ONC-ACB oversee the execution of the health IT developer’s real world testing plans, <br/>

which could include in-the-field surveillance per § 170.556, as an acceptable approach to meet <br/>
the requirements of the real world testing Condition of Certification.  <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that health IT developers with multiple certified health IT products that may <br/>
include the same interoperability-focused certification criteria intended to be implemented in the <br/>
same settings have the discretion to design their real world testing plans in a way that efficiently <br/>
tests a combination of products. Likewise, health IT developers may find portions of their real <br/>
world testing plans are transferrable to their other certified products; thus a health IT developer <br/>
could choose to submit a real world testing plan that covers multiple certified products as <br/>
appropriate and as long as there is traceability to the specific certified Health IT Modules. To be <br/>
clear, developers of health IT products deployed through the cloud who offer their products for <br/>
multiple types of settings would be required to test the same capability for those different <br/>
settings. However, we solicit comment on whether we should offer an exemption for services <br/>
that truly support all of a developer’s customers through a single interface/engine and whether <br/>
this would be sufficient to meet the intent of the real world testing Condition of Certification. <br/>
Additionally, while the developers’ plans must address each of the interoperability-focused <br/>
certification criteria in their certified health IT, developers can and should design scenario-based <br/>
test cases that incorporate multiple functionalities as appropriate for the real world workflow and <br/>
setting. <br/>
We propose that a health IT developer would submit annual real world testing results to <br/>
their ONC-ACBs via a publicly accessible hyperlink no later than January 31, of each calendar <br/>
year for the preceding calendar year’s real world testing. Real world testing results for each <br/>
interoperability-focused certification criterion must address the elements required in the previous <br/>

year’s testing plan, describe the outcomes of real world testing with any challenges encountered, <br/>
and provide at least one measurement or metric associated with the real world testing. As noted <br/>
above, developers are encouraged to use metrics demonstrating real world use from existing <br/>
networks and communities. We seek comment on whether ONC should require developers <br/>
submit real world testing results for a minimum “core” set of general metrics/measurements and <br/>
examples of suggested metrics/measurements. We also invite comment on the proposed annual <br/>
frequency and timing of required real world testing results reporting. <br/>
We acknowledge that a subsequent final rule for this proposed rule may not provide <br/>
sufficient time for health IT developers to develop and submit plans for a full year of real world <br/>
testing in 2020. If such a situation comes to fruition, we expect to provide an appropriate period <br/>
of time for developers to submit their plans and potentially treat 2020 as a “pilot” year for real <br/>
world testing. We would expect that such pilot testing conform to our proposed real world testing <br/>
to the extent practical and feasible (e.g., same criteria but for a shorter duration and without the <br/>
same consequences for non-compliance). We welcome comments on this potential approach. <br/>
We clarify, and propose, that even if a health IT developer does not have customers or <br/>
has not deployed their certified Health IT Module at the time the real world testing plan is due, <br/>
the health IT developer would still need to submit a plan that addresses its prospective testing for <br/>
the coming year for any health IT certified prior to August 31 of the preceding calendar year. If a <br/>
health IT developer does not have customers or has not deployed their certified Health IT <br/>
Module when the annual real world testing results are due, we propose that the developer would <br/>
need to report as such to meet the proposed Maintenance of Certification requirement. For <br/>

<i>Standards Version Advancement Process </i><br/>
As new and more advanced versions<a href="ONCs.html#285">96</a> become available for adopted standards and <br/>
implementation specifications applicable to criteria subject to the real world testing Condition <br/>
and Maintenance of Certification Requirements, we believe that a health IT developer’s ability to <br/>
conduct ongoing maintenance on its certified Health IT Module(s) to incorporate these new <br/>
versions is essential to support interoperability in the real world. Updated versions of standards <br/>
reflect insights gained from real-world implementation and use. They also reflect industry <br/>
stakeholders’ interests to improve the capacity, capability, and clarity of such standards to meet <br/>
new, innovative business needs, which earlier standards versions cannot support. Therefore, as <br/>
part of the real world testing Condition of Certification, we propose a Maintenance of <br/>
Certification flexibility that we refer to as the Standards Version Advancement Process. The <br/>
Standards Version Advancement Process would permit health IT developers to voluntarily use in <br/>
their certified Health IT Modules newer versions of adopted standards so long as certain <br/>
conditions are met, not limited to but notably including successful real world testing of the <br/>
Health IT Module using the new version(s).   <br/>
We propose to establish the Standards Version Advancement Processnot only to meet the <br/>
Cures Act’s goals for interoperability, but also in response to the continuous stakeholder <br/>
feedback that ONC has received through prior rulemakings and engagements, which requested <br/>
                                                 <br/>

that ONC establish a predictable and timely approach within the Program to keep pace with the <br/>
industry’s standards development efforts. Rulemaking has not kept up with the pace of standards <br/>
development and deployment in the health care market. There is no better evidence of this reality <br/>
than by example from our 2015 Edition rulemaking finalized approximately three years ago and <br/>
before the Cures Act added Conditions and Maintenance of Certification provisions to the <br/>
PHSA. Two version updates of the National Health Care Survey standard (versions 1.1 and 1.2) <br/>
have been issued since we adopted version 1.0 in the 2015 Edition final rule (October 16, 2015). <br/>
Health IT developer and health care provider compliance and use of these versions has and will <br/>
be necessary for submission to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) even though <br/>
the certification criterion adopted in § 170.315(f)(7) continues to require conformance to version <br/>
1.0. Similarly, many other adopted standards have seen multiple newer versions introduced to the <br/>
market since we issued the 2015 Edition final rule, such as for eCQM reporting or e-prescribing. <br/>
The proposed Standards Version Advancement Process flexibility gives health IT developers the <br/>
option to avoid such unnecessary costs and can help reduce market confusion by enabling <br/>
certified Health IT Modules keep pace with standards advancement and market needs including <br/>
but not limited to those related to emerging public health concerns.  <br/>
We have also been informed by stakeholders that, in other cases, ONC’s inability to more <br/>
nimbly identify and incorporate newer versions to standards and implementation specifications <br/>
that were already adopted by the Secretary into the Program has perversely impacted standards <br/>
developing organization (SDO) processes. Although SDOs can rapidly iterate version updates to <br/>
standards and implementation specifications to address ambiguities and implementation <br/>
challenges reported from the field and to particularly address matters that adversely impact <br/>

interoperability, the lack of a clear path for that work effort to be timely realized as part of the <br/>
Program’s certification requirements has had a chilling effect on the pace of change. It can also <br/>
affect the willingness of volunteers at these SDOs to devote their time to make updates that <br/>
would be outdated by the time ONC goes through a rulemaking, which can be years. <br/>
Stakeholders have indicated that certified health IT developers, customers and users of certified <br/>
health IT, and the SDO industry have been technologically restricted and innovation-stunted as a <br/>
result of our prior regulatory approach, which focused on certification assuring compliance only <br/>
to the version of a standard adopted in regulation and did not provide an avenue for the Program <br/>
to accommodate iterative updates to standards during the time between rulemakings. With the <br/>
passage of the “maintenance of certification” provision in § 4002 of the Cures Act, we believe <br/>
the approach proposed here is in line with our new statutory authority regarding Conditions of <br/>
Certification and Maintenance of Certification and would better and more timely support market <br/>
demands for widespread interoperability.  <br/>
In supporting more rapid advancement of interoperability, we believe the proposed <br/>
Standards Version Advancement Process approach will benefit patient care, improve <br/>
competition, and spur additional engagement in standards development. To this point, currently, <br/>
if the USCDI v1 were adopted as currently proposed in § 170.213 and then needed to be updated <br/>
to add just one data class or data element (e.g., a new demographic element), we would need to <br/>
initiate notice and comment rulemaking to incorporate that USCDI version change into the <br/>
Program. Likewise, similar updates to standards included in our 2015 Edition final rule are made <br/>
annually (or more frequently) by SDOs. In order to attempt to keep pace with such updates, <br/>
which are published at different times of the year, ONC would need to continuously engage in <br/>

rulemaking cycles, perhaps even more than once per year. We believe that the proposed <br/>
Standards Version Advancement Process would allow for more advanced versions of standards <br/>
and implementation specifications to be approved for use under the Program in a more timely <br/>
and flexible manner that helps to ease the concerns stakeholders have reported. Stakeholder input <br/>
throughout the Program’s existence has informed ONC that updating large groupings of <br/>
standards’ versions while also adopting new standards through rulemakings that only occur about <br/>
once every three years can create an artificial market impact in a number of ways. Such “all-in-<br/>
one” updates affect all health IT developers and the vast majority of health care providers at the <br/>
same time across all sectors rather than enabling a more incremental and market-based upgrade <br/>
cycle in response to interoperability, business, and clinical needs.  <br/>
The Standards Version Advancement Process and corresponding proposed revisions to §§ <br/>
170.550 and 170.555 would introduce two types of administrative flexibility for health IT <br/>
developers participating in the Program. First, for those health IT developers with an existing <br/>
certified Health IT Module, the Health IT Modules would be permitted to be upgraded (in the <br/>
course of ongoing maintenance) to a new version of an adopted standard within the scope of the <br/>
certification (without having to retest or recertify) so long as such version was approved by the <br/>
National Coordinator for use in certification through the Standards Version Advancement <br/>
Process. Second, for those health IT developers seeking to have a Health IT Module’s initial <br/>
certificate issued, the Health IT Module would be permitted to be presented for certification to a <br/>
new version of an adopted standard so long as such version was approved by the National <br/>
Coordinator through the Standards Version Advancement Process. This policy flexibility is <br/>
similar to the flexibility we introduced several years ago for “minimum standards” code sets, but <br/>

In order to ensure equitable treatment under the Program and in order for ONC to <br/>
maintain the Program’s overall integrity, each developer that chooses to leverage the proposed <br/>
Standards Version Advancement Process Maintenance of Certification Program flexibilities <br/>
would need to satisfy the following.   <br/>
<i>Health IT Developers Updating Already Certified Health IT </i><br/>
In instances where a health IT developer has certified a Health IT Module, including but <br/>
not limited to instances where its customers are already using the certified Health IT Module, if <br/>
the developer intends to update pursuant to the Standards Version Advancement Process <br/>
election, the developer would be required to provide advance notice to all affected customers and <br/>
its ONC-ACB: (a) expressing its intent to update the software to the more advanced version of <br/>
the standard approved by the National Coordinator through the Standards Version Advancement <br/>
Process; (b) the developer’s expectations for how the update will affect interoperability of the <br/>
affected Health IT Module as it is used in the real world; and (c) whether the developer intends <br/>
to continue to support the certificate for the existing Health IT Module version for some period <br/>
of time and how long, or if the existing version of the Health IT Module certified to prior <br/>
version(s) of applicable standards will be deprecated (e.g., that the developer will stop supporting <br/>
                                                 <br/>
97 For purposes of clarity, we note that the Standards Version Advancement Process would not affect the established <br/>minimum standards code sets flexibility. Consistent with § 170.555, under the Program, health IT could continue to <br/>be certified or upgraded to a newer version of identified minimum standards code sets (<i>see </i>80 FR 62612) than even <br/>the most recent one the National Coordinator had approved for use in the Program via the Standards Version <br/>Advancement Processunless the Secretary prohibits the use of the newer version for certification.   <br/> <br/>

would be required to be provided sufficiently in advance of the developer establishing its <br/>
planned timeframe for implementation of the upgrade to the more advanced standard(s) <br/>
version(s) in order to offer customers reasonable opportunity to ask questions and plan for the <br/>
update. We request public comment on the minimum time prior to an anticipated implementation <br/>
of an updated standard or implementation specification version update that should be considered <br/>
reasonable for purposes of allowing customers, especially health care providers using the Health <br/>
IT Module in their health care delivery operations, to adequately plan for potential implications <br/>
of the update for their operations and their exchange relationships. We would also be interested <br/>
to know if commenters believe that there are specific certification criteria, standards, <br/>
characteristics of the certified Health IT Module or its implementation (such as locally hosted by <br/>
the customer using it versus software-as-a-service type of implementation), or specific types or <br/>
characteristics of customers that could affect the minimum advance notice that should be <br/>
considered reasonable across variations in these factors. <br/>
We anticipate providing ONC-ACBs (and/or health IT developers) with a means to <br/>
attribute this updated information to the listings on the CHPL for the Health IT Modules the <br/>
ONC-ACB has certified, and propose to require in the Principles of Proper Conduct for ONC-<br/>
ACBs that they are ultimately responsible for this information being made publicly available on <br/>
the CHPL. We request public comment on any additional information about updated standards <br/>
versions that may be beneficial to have listed with certified Health IT Modules on the CHPL.  <br/>

National Coordinator were to approve for use through the Standards Version Advancement <br/>
Process several different new versions of adopted standards that affected different certification <br/>
criteria within the scope of a certified Health IT Module, the developer would be able to just <br/>
update one certification criterion to one or more of the applicable new standards and would not <br/>

<i>Health IT Developers Presenting a New Health IT Module for Certification and </i><br/>
<i>Leveraging the Standards Version Advancement Process </i><br/>
 <br/>
In instances where a health IT developer presents a Health IT Module for certification for <br/>
which no prior certificate can serve as the basis for using the Standards  Version Advancement <br/>
Process, we propose that the health IT developer would be permitted to use and implement any <br/>
and all of the newer versions of adopted standards the National Coordinator approves through the <br/>
Standards Version Advancement Process. We have implemented this proposed policy through <br/>
necessary adjustments to the way in which ONC-ACBs process certifications in § 170.550. We <br/>
recognize that this proposed flexibility reflects certain programmatic and policy trade-offs. On <br/>
one hand, a health IT developer would be permitted to use the most recent version of standards <br/>
approved by the National Coordinator instead of having to build in potentially “outdated” <br/>
standards just to get certified. On the other hand, the Program’s testing infrastructure (which is <br/>
now inclusive of government- developed and non-government-developed tools) may experience <br/>
certain lag times in terms of when updated test tools to support the approved version <br/>

advancements would be available to test Health IT Modules for certification purposes. As a <br/>
result, we propose to provide the ability for ONC-ACBs to accept a developer self-declaration of <br/>
conformity as to the use, implementation, and conformance to a newer version of a standard <br/>
(including but not limited to implementation specifications) as sufficient demonstration of <br/>
conformance in circumstances where the National Coordinator has approved a version update of <br/>
a standard for use in certification through the Standards Version Advancement Process but an <br/>
associated testing tool is not yet updated to test to the newer version. Again, we clarify that a <br/>
health IT developer would be able to choose which National Coordinator-approved standard <br/>
version(s) it seeks to include in a new or updated certified Health IT Module and would be able <br/>
to do so on an itemized basis. <br/>
On balance, we believe that this programmatic flexibility and the potential <br/>
interoperability improvements from the use of newer versions of standards outweighs the <br/>
subsequent oversight challenges. Moreover, these oversight challenges can be mitigated by the <br/>
Standards Version Advancement Process itself (i.e., the National Coordinator not approving a <br/>
new version if the Program or industry is not ready) and the corresponding Conditions of <br/>
Certification that continue with the use of National Coordinator-approved new versions of <br/>
adopted standards. We also believe that this approach will continue to hold developers <br/>
accountable for, and shift the focus of Health IT Module performance demonstration to, real <br/>
world testing for interoperability for deployed Health IT Modules. As described above, we <br/>
understand the limitations of test methods used prior to certification and further emphasize the <br/>
importance of continued conformance of Health IT Modules in the field. However, we request <br/>
comment on specific Program impacts we should consider.  <br/>

<i>General Requirements Associated with Health IT Modules Certified using the Standards <br/>Version Advancement Process <br/> <br/></i>In all cases, regardless of whether a health IT developer is updating an existing certified <br/>
Health IT Module or presenting a new Health IT Module for certification to new versions of <br/>
adopted standards approved by the National Coordinator through the Standards Version <br/>
Advancement Process, it would need to adhere to the following once it elects to takes advantage <br/>
of this proposed flexibility: <br/>
•  The developer would need to ensure its mandatory disclosures in § 170.523(k)(1) <br/>
appropriately reflect its use of any National Coordinator-approved newer versions of <br/>
standards. <br/>
•  The developer would need to address and adhere to all Conditions of Certification and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirements proposed that are otherwise be applicable to its <br/>
certified Health IT Modules regardless of whether those Health IT Modules were certified to <br/>
the exact same versions of adopted standards that are listed in the text of 45 CFR part 170 or <br/>
National Coordinator-approved newer version(s) of the standard(s). For instance, the <br/>
developer would need to ensure that its real world testing plan and performance included the <br/>
National Coordinator-approved standards versions to which it is claiming conformance.   <br/>
In terms of compliance with the real world testing Condition and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification requirements, the attestations Condition and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirements proposed in § 170.406, and for the purposes of ONC-ACB surveillance, we note <br/>
that health IT developers would be accountable for maintaining all applicable certified Health IT <br/>
Modules in accordance with approved versions of standards and implementation specifications <br/>
that they voluntarily elect to use in their certified health IT. If, at any point after initial <br/>

certification or updated certification for a Health IT Module using the National Coordinator <br/>
approved advanced versions of standards or implementation specifications, real world testing <br/>
results do not demonstrate the Health IT Module’s conformance to each applicable certification <br/>
criterion had been achieved and maintained using the National Coordinator approved advanced <br/>
version update of any applicable standard(s) and implementation specification(s), then the <br/>
developer would not be allowed to claim or characterize the Health IT Module as conformant to <br/>
the criterion using such standard version, and the standard or implementation specification <br/>
version could not be indicated in the health IT Module’s CHPL record as supported by any <br/>
version release of the Health IT Module, until such time as they could demonstrate through <br/>
ONC-ATL or results of real world testing that they had successfully upgraded the Health IT <br/>
Module to fully conform to applicable certification criteria while incorporating the more <br/>
advanced version of the standard. Non-conformities associated with the use of new versions of <br/>
National Coordinator-approved standards would be found and enforced through the same <br/>
Program rules just like they would be for non-conformities with the versions of adopted <br/>
standards that are codified in regulation text. Further, we remind health IT developers that they <br/>
would be required to make an attestation to their real world testing results, including (though not <br/>
limited to) those that would be used to support use of new versions of National Coordinator-<br/>
approved standards. <br/>
<i>Advanced Version Approval Approach </i><br/>
Once a standard has been adopted for use in the Program through notice and comment <br/>
rulemaking, ONC would undertake an annual, open and transparent process, including <br/>
opportunity for public comment, to timely ascertain whether a more recent version of that <br/>

 <br/>
standard or implementation specification should be approved for developers’ voluntary use. <br/>
ONC would identify updated versions of previously adopted standards and implementation <br/>
specifications based on our own monitoring of market trends and interoperability needs, as well <br/>
as input received from external stakeholders. Such external input may include, but would not be <br/>
limited to, recommendations made by the Health Information Technology Advisory Committee <br/>
as well as input received from SDOs.  <br/>
ONC expects to use an expanded section of the Interoperability Standards Advisory <br/>
(ISA) web platform to facilitate the public transparency and engagement process. At a particular <br/>
time of the year (e.g., early fall), ONC would post a list of new versions of adopted standards and <br/>
implementation specifications that appear timely and appropriate for use within the Program (for <br/>
the subsequent calendar year) along with accompanying descriptive context (e.g., the <br/>
types/nature of updates in the new version of a standard). ONC would then widely communicate <br/>
to all members of the public that the list was available and make a general solicitation of <br/>
comments to any and all interested parties for a period of 30 to 60 days. We would generally <br/>
expect to receive comments on a range of issues related to the version of the standard under <br/>
consideration, including its availability, testing tools, maturity, implementation burden, and <br/>
overall impact on interoperability. Health IT developers, health information networks (HINs), <br/>
and the health care organizations that purchase and use health IT are already familiar with the <br/>
process of commenting through our existing ISA resource and we believe this process is well <br/>
suited to support widespread engagement by all stakeholders. Similar to the ISA, we would <br/>
expect to be open to receiving comments on newer versions of adopted standards throughout the <br/>
year leading up to the formal comment period. <br/>

 <br/>
Once the formal comment period closes, ONC would review the comments and consider <br/>
the potential impacts of a new version an adopted standard or implementation specification. We <br/>
anticipate approving newer versions of adopted standards and implementation specifications <br/>
based on several interdependent Program and market factors, such as its ability to enhance <br/>
interoperability and overall compatibility with other adopted versions, how burdensome it would <br/>
be to update to the newer version and the scope and scale of the changes, whether the new <br/>
version would be required for reporting by a corresponding program (e.g., CMS or CDC), the <br/>
availability of test tools for the new version, and the new version’s relationship to other adopted <br/>
standards and any dependencies. Upon concluding our review and analysis, ONC would publish <br/>
in this new ISA section a final list of National Coordinator-approved advanced versions that <br/>
health IT developers could electively use consistent with the Standards Version Advancement <br/>
Process.   <br/>
Within this proposed approach, we expect that when it comes to a standard, the National <br/>
Coordinator would identify version updates to an adopted standard consistent with that <br/>
standard’s name and version track. This method would provide long-term consistency for health <br/>
IT developers in terms of the overall technical conformance requirements on which they will be <br/>
focused.  <br/>
With respect to adopted implementation specifications, we believe that more flexibility <br/>
about the precise name and version track identifiers would be warranted given that <br/>
implementation specifications are developed by market-driven industry consortia (e.g., Argonaut <br/>
project and Direct project stakeholders) as well as traditional SDOs. Similarly, authors of <br/>
implementation specifications sometimes develop supplemental documents to the “parent” <br/>

implementation specification or split the implementation specification to form newly titled <br/>
materials. In any of these cases, the resulting implementation specification may—on its face—<br/>
initially appear to bear no relation to a previously adopted implementation specification because <br/>
of changes to its title, version naming, or numbering presentation. In reality, in many of these <br/>
cases, the implementation specification retains substantially the same purpose(s) and thus <br/>
represents a versioning update rather than amounting to a novel specification. Accordingly, <br/>
regardless of its title and author, the National Coordinator would take into account whether any <br/>
“new” implementation specification under consideration is more accurately characterized as <br/>
novel to the Program or instead is a derivative work that is substantially a more advanced version <br/>
of a previously adopted implementation specification(s). Stakeholders would also be able to <br/>
comment on the same during the advanced version approval process described here. <br/>
The public listing of these National Coordinator determinations to approve version <br/>
updates to already adopted standards and implementation specifications would serve as the <br/>
single, comprehensive, and authoritative index of the versions of adopted standards and <br/>
implementation specifications available for use under the Program. We note, however, that <br/>
certain Program administration steps would need to occur (such as ONC-ACBs expanding the <br/>
scope of their accreditations) after the National Coordinator has approved newer versions of <br/>
adopted standards. As a result, there would likely be a temporary delay between the National <br/>
Coordinator’s approval decision and when certification to new standards versions under the <br/>
Program would start.    <br/>

approval process as an option available to developers through maintenance requirements as part <br/>

of the real world testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification. This includes all aspects of <br/>
our described approach to standards and implementation specification advanced version approval <br/>
processes. We also invite comments on our proposal to allow in conjunction with this <br/>
maintenance flexibility the opportunity for developers to elect to present health IT for initial <br/>
testing and certification either to more advanced versions or the prior versions included in <br/>
regulatory text as of the date the technology is presented. <br/>
<i>Principle of Proper Conduct for ONC-ACB for all Real World Testing Proposals </i><br/>
We propose to include a new Principle of Proper Conduct for ONC-ACBs in § <br/>
170.523(p) that would require ONC-ACBs to review and confirm that applicable health IT <br/>
developers submit real world testing plans and results in accordance with our proposals. We <br/>
expect that ONC-ACBs would review the plans for completeness. Once completeness is <br/>
confirmed, ONC-ACBs would provide the plans to ONC by December 15 and results to ONC by <br/>
April 1. The December 15 date is the same date as the health IT developer requirement for <br/>
submission of the real world testing plan. For purposes of the Program, this treats both regulated <br/>
entities equally and permits them to work out a process that ensures all real world testing plans <br/>
are submitted to the CHPL by December 15. For example, a health IT developer that is confident <br/>
in its plan and does not anticipate any further certification, may submit its plan in July of the <br/>
preceding year.  <br/>
The submission of results, however, does not present the same dynamic of the potential <br/>
need to work together to ensure the plan is complete. As such, we have proposed different dates. <br/>
We would expect the developers to submit their results by January 31. We believe this would <br/>
provide sufficient time for ONC-ACBs to review all plans and post them to the CHPL by April <br/>

1, including notifying ONC when the results were not in compliance with requirements. ONC <br/>
would make both the plans and results publicly available via the CHPL. We note that ONC-<br/>
ACBs will continue to be required to perform in-the-field surveillance of certified Health IT <br/>
Modules and results of real world testing could be considered information to inform ONC-ACB <br/>
surveillance activities.  <br/>
Because we are proposing to allow health IT developers to implement National <br/>
Coordinator-approved advanced versions of standards and implementation specifications in <br/>
certified Health IT Modules through a developer self-declaration of conformity presented for <br/>
certification if an associated testing tool is not yet updated to test to the newer version for the <br/>
standards and implementation specification version updates they have chosen to use in the <br/>
Program, we propose two requirements to ensure the public and ONC-ACBs have knowledge of <br/>
the version of a standard that certified health IT meets. First, we propose to revise the Principle <br/>
of Proper Conduct in § 170.523(m) to require ONC-ACBs to collect, no less than quarterly, all <br/>
version updates made to standards successfully included in certified health IT per the <br/>
requirements within the real world testing Condition of Certification Standards Version <br/>
Advancement Process. This would ensure that ONC-ACBs are aware of the version of a standard <br/>
that certified health IT meets for the purposes of surveillance and Program administration. <br/>
Second, we propose (as discussed above), that a developer that chooses to avail itself of the <br/>
Standards Version Advancement Process flexibility must address in its real world testing plans <br/>
and results submissions the timeline and rollout of applicable version updates for standards and <br/>
implementation specifications. This addition to § 170.523(m) along with existing requirements <br/>
for weekly ONC-ACB CHPL reporting to versions of standards per § 170.523(f)(1)(xvii) would <br/>

 <br/>
allow for timely updates to Health IT Module certificate information in the CHPL. Together with <br/>
the requirements (discussed above) for developers’ communication with their current and <br/>
potential customers, we intend to ensure that the public and end-users have transparency into <br/>
planned and actual standards and implementation specifications updates for their certified health <br/>
IT. <br/>
In complement to the above requirements to ensure transparency for the public and end <br/>
users, we propose in § 170.523(t) a new Principle of Proper Conduct for ONC-ACBs requiring <br/>
them to ensure that developers seeking to take advantage of the Standards Version Advancement <br/>
Process flexibility in § 170.405(b)(5) comply with the applicable requirements, and that the <br/>
ONC-ACB both retain records of the timing and content of developers’ § 170.405(b)(5) notices <br/>
and timely post each notice’s content publicly on the CHPL attributed to the certified Health IT <br/>
Modules to which it applies. <br/>
We seek comment on the proposed additions to the Principles of Proper Conduct for <br/>
ONC-ACBs. More specifically, we seek comment on whether ONC-ACBs should be required to <br/>
perform an evaluation beyond a completeness check for the real world testing plans and results <br/>
and the value versus the burden of such an endeavor. <br/>
6. Attestations <br/>
<b> </b><br/>
The<b> </b>Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification under the Program, provide to the Secretary an attestation to all the Conditions of <br/>
Certification specified in the Cures Act, except for the “EHR reporting criteria submission” <br/>
Condition of Certification. We propose to implement the Cures Act “attestations” requirements <br/>
Condition of Certification in § 170.406. We also propose that, as part of the implementation of <br/>

 <br/>
this statutory provision, health IT developers would attest, as applicable, to compliance with the <br/>
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements described in this section of the <br/>
preamble and proposed in §§ 170.401 through 170.405.  <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement for the “attestations” <br/>
Condition of Certification, health IT developers must submit their attestations every 6 months <br/>
(i.e., semiannually). We believe this would provide an appropriate “attestation period” to base <br/>
any enforcement actions, such as by ONC under the Program or by the Office of the Inspector <br/>
General under its Cures Act authority. We also believe this 6-month attestation period properly <br/>
balances the need to support appropriate enforcement actions with the attestation burden placed <br/>
on developers. We will determine when the first attestation will be due depending on when the <br/>
final rule is published. We require attestations to be due twice a year, likely in the middle and <br/>
end of the calendar year. <br/>
  <br/>
The process we plan to implement for providing attestations should minimize burden on <br/>
health IT developers. First, we propose to provide a 14-day attestation period twice a year. For <br/>
health IT developers presenting health IT for certification for the first time under the Program, <br/>
we propose that they would be required to submit an attestation at the time of certification and <br/>
then also comply with the semiannual attestation periods. Second, we would publicize and <br/>
prompt developers to complete their attestation during the required attestation periods. Third, we <br/>
propose to provide a method for health IT developers to indicate their compliance, non-<br/>
compliance with, or the inapplicability of each Condition and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirement as it applies to all of their health IT certified under the Program for each attestation <br/>
period. Last, we propose to provide health IT developers the flexibility to specify non-<br/>

compliance per certified Health IT Module, if necessary. We note, however, that any non-<br/>
compliance with the proposed Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, <br/>
including the “attestations” Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, would be <br/>
subject to ONC direct review, corrective action, and enforcement procedures under the Program. <br/>
We refer readers to section VII.D of this preamble for discussion of proposed ONC direct <br/>
review, corrective action, and enforcement procedures for the Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification requirements under the Program. <br/>
  <br/>
We propose that attestations would be submitted to ONC-ACBs on behalf of ONC and <br/>
the Secretary. We propose that ONC-ACBs would have two responsibilities related to <br/>
attestations. One responsibility we propose in § 170.523(q) is that an ONC-ACB must review <br/>
and submit the health IT developers’ attestations to ONC. ONC would then make the attestations <br/>
publicly available through the CHPL. The other responsibility we propose in § 170.550(l) is that <br/>
before issuing a certification, an ONC-ACB would need to ensure that the health IT developer of <br/>
the Health IT Module has met its responsibilities related to the Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification requirements as solely evidenced by its attestation. For example, if a health IT <br/>
developer with an active certification under the Program indicated non-compliant designations in <br/>
their attestation but is already participating in a corrective action plan under ONC direct review <br/>
to resolve the non-compliance, certification would be able to proceed while the issue is being <br/>
resolved. <br/>
 <br/>
We welcome comments on the proposed attestations Condition and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification requirements, including the appropriate frequency and timing of attestations. We <br/>

 <br/>
also welcome comments on the proposed responsibilities for ONC-ACBs related to the <br/>
attestations of Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements. <br/>
7. EHR Reporting Criteria Submission <br/>
  <br/>
The Cures Act specifies that health IT developers be required, as a Condition and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification under the Program, to submit reporting criteria on certified health <br/>
IT in accordance with the EHR reporting program established under section 3009A of the PHSA, <br/>
as added by the Cures Act. We have not yet established an EHR reporting program. Once ONC <br/>
establishes such program, we will undertake future rulemaking to propose and implement the <br/>
associated Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement(s) for health IT developers.<b> </b><br/>
<i>C. Compliance </i><br/>
The proposed Maintenance of Certification requirements discussed above do not <br/>
necessarily define all the outcomes necessary to meet the Conditions of Certification. Rather, <br/>
they provide preliminary or baseline evidence toward measuring whether a Condition is being <br/>
met. Thus, ONC could determine that a Condition of Certification is not being met through <br/>
reasons other than the Maintenance of Certification requirements. For example, meeting the <br/>
proposed Maintenance of Certification requirement that requires a health IT developer to not <br/>
establish or enforce any contract or agreement that contravenes the Communications Condition <br/>
of Certification does not excuse a health IT developer from meeting all the requirements <br/>
specified in the proposed Communications Condition of Certification. This is analogous to <br/>
clarifications ONC has previously provided about certification criteria requirements whereby <br/>
testing prior to certification sometimes only tests a subset of the full criterion’s intended <br/>
functions and scope. However, for compliance and surveillance purposes, we have stated that <br/>

 <br/>
ONC and its ONC-ACBs will examine whether the certified health IT meets the full scope of the <br/>
certification criterion rather than the subset of functions it was tested against (80 FR 62709-10). <br/>
<i>D. Enforcement </i><br/>
The Cures Act affirms ONC’s role in using certification to improve health IT’s <br/>
capabilities for the access, use, and exchange of electronic health information. The Cures Act <br/>
provides this affirmation through expanded certification authority for ONC to establish <br/>
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements for health IT developers that go <br/>
beyond the certified health IT itself. The new Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
provisions in section 4002 of the Cures Act focus on the actions and business practices of health <br/>
IT developers (e.g., information blocking and appropriate access, use, and exchange of electronic <br/>
health information) as well as technical interoperability of health IT (e.g., APIs and real world <br/>
testing). Furthermore and equally important, section 4002 of the Cures Act provides that the <br/>
Secretary of HHS may encourage compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification requirements and take action to discourage noncompliance. As discussed in the <br/>
2015 Edition final rule, ONC is not limited to enforcing Program compliance solely through <br/>
those requirements expressed in certification criteria adopted under the Program (80 FR 62710; <br/>
see also 81 FR 72412). Certification under the Program also relies on a health IT developer’s <br/>
compliance with Program requirements that ensure the basic integrity and effectiveness of the <br/>
Program, which is further stressed through the addition of the Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification requirements in the Cures Act (referred to jointly as the “Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification” in this section of the preamble).  <br/>

 <br/>
Given these considerations, we propose a general enforcement approach outlining a <br/>
corrective action process for ONC to review potential or known instances where a Condition or <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirement has not been or is not being met by a health IT <br/>
developer under the Program, including the requirement for a health IT developer to attest to <br/>
meeting the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification. Table 3 below provides an overview of <br/>
the proposed approach to ONC enforcement of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification. <br/>
We provide more specific proposals following Table 3.  <br/>

1. ONC Direct Review of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification Requirements <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to utilize the processes previously established for ONC direct review of <br/>
certified health IT in the EOA final rule (81 FR 72404) and codified in §§ 170.580 and 170.581 <br/>
for the enforcement of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification. We propose this <br/>
approach for multiple reasons. First, these processes were established to address non-<br/>

 <br/>
conformities with Program requirements. Conditions and Maintenance of Certification are <br/>
proposed to be adopted as Program requirements and, as such, any noncompliance with the <br/>
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification would constitute a Program non-conformity. <br/>
Second, health IT developers are familiar with the ONC direct review provisions as they were <br/>
established in October 2016. Third, §§ 170.580 and 170.581 provide thorough and transparent <br/>
processes for working with health IT developers through notice and corrective action to remedy <br/>
Program non-conformities. Last, the direct review framework provides equitable opportunities <br/>
for health IT developers to respond to ONC actions and appeal certain ONC determinations.  <br/>
 <br/>
2. Review and Enforcement Only by ONC <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to retain use of the term “direct review” as previously adopted in the EOA <br/>
final rule to continue to distinguish actions ONC takes to directly review certified health IT or <br/>
health IT developers’ actions in comparison to an ONC-ACB’s review of certified health IT <br/>
under surveillance. We propose, however, that ONC would be the sole party responsible for <br/>
enforcing compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification. The Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification focus on health IT developer behavior and actions in addition to the <br/>
certified Health IT Module. ONC is more familiar with the behavioral requirements based on its <br/>
expertise and experience. Conversely, ONC-ACBs are generally more suited, based on their <br/>
accreditation and current responsibilities, to address non-conformities with technical and other <br/>
Program requirements. ONC also has the necessary resources and the ability to coordinate with <br/>
other agencies to enforce the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification, such as with the <br/>
“information blocking” Condition of Certification (proposed § 170.401). Further, ONC <br/>
enforcement would provide more predictability and consistency, which would likely benefit <br/>

below the scope of ONC-ACB surveillance as it relates to ONC’s proposed enforcement of the <br/>
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification. <br/>
 <br/>
3. Review Processes <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to substantially adopt the processes as they are currently codified in §§ <br/>
170.580 and 170.581 for ONC’s review and enforcement of the Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification, but propose certain revisions and additions to the processes to properly incorporate <br/>
the proposed Conditions and Maintenance of Certification and effectuate Congressional intent. <br/>
These revisions and additions include renaming and restructuring headings for clarity, which we <br/>
do not discuss below.  <br/>
 <br/>
a. Initiating Review and Health IT Developer Notice <br/>
We propose to fully incorporate the review of the Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification into the provisions of § 170.580(a) and (b). We propose in § 170.580(a)(iii) that if <br/>
ONC has a reasonable belief that a health IT developer has not complied with a Condition of <br/>
Certification, then it <i>may</i> initiate direct review. Similarly, we propose in § 170.580(b)(1) and (2) <br/>
that ONC may issue the health IT developer a notice of potential non-conformity or notice of <br/>
non-conformity and provide the health IT developer an opportunity to respond with an <br/>
explanation and written documentation, including any information ONC requests. These <br/>
processes, including relevant timeframes, are specified in § 170.580(b).  <br/>
i. Complaint Resolution <br/>
We note and recommend that customers and end-users first work with their health IT <br/>
developers to resolve any issues of potential non-compliance with the Conditions and <br/>

 <br/>
Maintenance of Certification as prior Program experience has shown that many issues can be <br/>
resolved at this step. If the issue cannot be resolved, we then recommend the end-user contact the <br/>
ONC-ACB. However, as discussed above and in section VII.D.5 below, the ONC-ACB purview <br/>
for certified health IT generally applies to certified capabilities and limited requirements of <br/>
developer business practices. If neither of these pathways resolves the issue, end-users may <br/>
provide feedback to ONC via the Health IT Feedback Form.<a href="ONCs.html#308">98 </a><br/>

 <br/>
ii. Method of Correspondence with Health IT Developers <br/>

National Coordinator shall be conducted by email, unless otherwise necessary or specified. In the <br/>
EOA final rule, we signaled our intent to send notices of potential non-conformity, non-<br/>
conformity, suspension, proposed termination, and termination via certified mail (81 FR 72429). <br/>
However, in accordance with § 170.505, we propose that email should be the default mode of <br/>
correspondence for direct review of non-compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification.  <br/>
Under the EOA final rule, ONC can initiate direct review of certified health IT in limited <br/>
circumstances, namely when there is a reasonable belief that the certified health IT may be <br/>
causing or contributing to serious risks to public health or safety or suspected non-conformities <br/>
present practical challenges that may prevent an ONC-ACB from effectively investigating or <br/>
responding to the suspected non-conformity. In contrast, we propose in this proposed rule to <br/>
enable ONC to initiate direct review to address a health IT developer’s conduct under the <br/>
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements in addition to non-conformities in <br/>
                                                 <br/>

certified health IT. This proposal would create an expanded set of circumstances for ONC to <br/>
conduct direct review. Accordingly, the type and extent of review by ONC could vary <br/>
significantly based on the complexity and severity of each fact pattern. For instance, ONC may <br/>
be able to address certain non-conformities under the Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification quickly and with minimal effort (e.g., failure to make public a documentation <br/>
hyperlink), while others may be more complex and require additional time and effort (e.g., <br/>
violation of API fee prohibitions). Considering this wide range of potential non-conformities <br/>
under the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification, we believe it is appropriate for ONC to <br/>
retain discretion to decide, on a case-by-case basis, when to go beyond the provisions of § <br/>
170.505 in providing notices and correspondence for non-compliance with the Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification.   <br/>
We solicit comment on the nature and types of non-conformities with the Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirements that ONC should consider in determining the method <br/>
of correspondence. We also solicit comment on whether the type of notice should affect the <br/>
method of correspondence and whether certain types of notices under direct review should be <br/>
considered more critical than others, thus requiring a specific method of correspondence.  <br/>
b. Relationship with ONC-ACBs and ONC-ATLs <br/>
Section 170.580(a)(3) outlines ONC direct review in relation to the roles of ONC-ACBs <br/>
and ONC-ATLs, which we propose to revise to incorporate Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification. We note that we provide situational examples below in section VII.D.5 “Effect on <br/>
Existing Program Requirements and Processes” regarding ONC direct review and the role of an <br/>
ONC-ACB. As finalized in the EOA final rule and per § 170.580(a)(3)(v), we remind readers <br/>

that ONC may refer the applicable part of its review of certified health IT to the relevant ONC-<br/>
ACB(s) if ONC determines this would serve the effective administration or oversight of the <br/>
Program (81 FR 72427-72428).   <br/>
c. Records Access <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to revise § 170.580(b)(3) to ensure that ONC, or third parties acting on its <br/>
behalf, has access to the information necessary to enforce the Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification. As specified in § 170.580(b)(1)(ii)(A)(<i>2</i>), (b)(2)(ii)(A)(<i>2</i>) and (b)(3), in response to <br/>
a notice of potential non-conformity or notice of non-conformity, ONC must be granted access <br/>
to, and have the ability to share within HHS, with other federal agencies, and with appropriate <br/>
entities, all of a health IT developers’ records and technology related to the development, testing, <br/>
certification, implementation, maintenance, and use of a health IT developers’ certified health <br/>
IT; and any complaint records related to the certified health IT. “Complaint records” include, but <br/>
are not limited to issue logs and help desk tickets (81 FR 72431). We propose to supplement <br/>
these requirements with a requirement that a health IT developer make available to ONC, and <br/>
third parties acting on its behalf, records related to marketing and distribution, communications, <br/>
contracts, and any other information relevant to compliance with any of the Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification or other Program requirements. This information would assist in <br/>
reviewing allegations that a health IT developer violated, for example, the “prohibit and restrict <br/>
communications” Condition of Certification. Further, it is possible that multiple Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification may be implicated under a review, and thus ONC believes it is <br/>
appropriate to require a developer make available to ONC <i>all </i>records and other relevant <br/>

 <br/>
information concerning all the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification and Program <br/>
requirements to which it and its Health IT Modules are subject. <br/>
 <br/>
 If ONC determined that a health IT developer was not cooperative with the fact-finding <br/>
process, we propose ONC would have the ability to issue a certification ban and/or terminate a <br/>
certificate (<i>see </i>proposed § 170.581 discussed below and § 170.580(f)(1)(iii)(A)(<i>1</i>)).  <br/>
 <br/>
We understand that health IT developers may have concerns regarding the disclosure of <br/>
proprietary, trade secret, competitively sensitive, or other confidential information. As we stated <br/>
in the EOA final rule (81 FR 72429), ONC would implement appropriate safeguards to ensure, to <br/>
the extent permissible with federal law, that any proprietary business information or trade secrets <br/>
ONC may encounter by accessing the health IT developer’s records, other information, or <br/>
technology, would be kept confidential by ONC or any third parties working on behalf of ONC. <br/>
However, a health IT developer would not be able to avoid providing ONC access to relevant <br/>
records by asserting that such access would require it to disclose trade secrets or other <br/>
proprietary or confidential information. Therefore, health IT developers must clearly mark, as <br/>
described in HHS Freedom of Information Act regulations at 45 CFR 5.65(c), any information <br/>
they regard as trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information which they seek <br/>
to keep confidential prior to disclosing the information to ONC or any third party working on <br/>
behalf of ONC. <br/>
 <br/>
d. Corrective Action <br/>
We propose that if ONC determines that a health IT developer is noncompliant with a <br/>
Condition of Certification (i.e., a non-conformity), ONC would work with the health IT <br/>
developer to establish a corrective action plan (CAP) to remedy the issue through the processes <br/>

 <br/>
specified in § 170.580(b)(2)(ii)(A)(<i>4</i>) and (c). We note that a health IT developer may be in <br/>
noncompliance with more than one Condition of Certification. In such cases, ONC will follow <br/>
the proposed compliance enforcement process for each Condition of Certification accordingly, <br/>
but may also require the health IT developer to address all violations in one CAP for efficiency <br/>
of process. We also propose, as we currently do with CAPs for certified health IT, to list health <br/>
IT developers under a CAP on ONC’s website. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
e. Certification Ban and Termination <br/>
We propose in § 170.581 that if a health IT developer under ONC direct review for non-<br/>
compliance with a Condition of Certification failed to work with ONC or was otherwise <br/>
noncompliant with the requirements of the CAP and/or CAP process, ONC could issue a <br/>
certification ban for the health IT developer (and its subsidiaries and successors). A certification <br/>
ban, as it currently does for other matters under § 170.581, would prohibit prospective <br/>
certification activity by the health IT developer.  <br/>
ONC would also consider termination<a href="ONCs.html#312">99</a> of the certificate(s) of the affected Health IT <br/>
Module(s) should the health IT developer fail to work with ONC or is otherwise noncompliant <br/>
with the requirements of the CAP and/or CAP process (<i>see</i> proposed § 170.580(f)(1)(iii)). ONC <br/>
may consider termination if there is a nexus between the developer’s actions or business <br/>
practices and certified Health IT Module(s) (<i>see</i> proposed § 170.580(f)(1)(iii)). For example, <br/>
ONC may determine that a health IT developer is violating a Condition of Certification due to a <br/>
clause in its contracts that prevents its users from sharing or discussing technological <br/>
                                                 <br/>
99 As noted in the EOA final rule, “termination” means an ONC action to “terminate” or “revoke” the certification <br/>status of a Complete EHR or Health IT Module. (81 FR 72443) <br/>

impediments to information exchange. In this example, the health IT developer’s conduct would <br/>
violate the “prohibiting or restricting communication” Condition of Certification proposed in § <br/>
170.403. If the same conduct were also found to impair the functionality of the certified Health <br/>
IT Module (such as by preventing the proper use of certified capabilities for the exchange of <br/>
EHI), ONC may determine that a nexus exists between the developer’s business practices and the <br/>
functionality of the certified Health IT Module, and may consider termination of the certificates <br/>
of that particular Health IT Module under the proposed approach. <br/>
We propose this approach, which allows ONC to initiate a certification ban and/or <br/>
certificate termination under certain circumstances, to ensure that health IT developers are acting <br/>
in accordance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification. However, we stress that our <br/>
first and foremost priority is to work with health IT developers to remedy any noncompliance <br/>
with Conditions and Maintenance of Certification through a corrective action process before <br/>
taking further action. This emphasizes ONC’s desire to promote and support health IT developer <br/>
compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification and ensure that certified health <br/>
IT is compliant with Program requirements in order to foster an environment where EHI is <br/>
exchanged in an interoperable way.  <br/>
ONC does not believe that noncompliance with a Condition of Certification should <br/>
always result in the termination of the certificate of one or more of a developer’s Health IT <br/>
Modules for a few reasons. A violation of a Condition of Certification may relate solely to health <br/>
IT developer business practices or actions that do not affect the Health IT Module’s conformance <br/>
to the requirements of the certification criteria. In this case, termination of the certification could <br/>
unfairly and negatively affect a provider’s ability to use the Health IT Module for participation in <br/>

CMS programs that require certification because the Health IT Module itself is functioning in <br/>
accordance with the technical requirements of its certificate.<a href="ONCs.html#314">100 </a>As such, ONC would carefully <br/>
consider on a case-by-case basis the appropriateness of termination of a Health IT Module’s <br/>
certification(s) based on the specific circumstances of the noncompliance with the Condition of <br/>
Certification. The proposed enforcement approach balances the above stated goals and provides <br/>
an outlined process that can be consistently followed.  <br/>
In considering whether termination of a Health IT Module’s certificate(s) and/or a <br/>
certification ban is appropriate, ONC will consider factors including, but not limited to: whether <br/>
the health IT developer has previously been found in noncompliance with the Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification or other Program requirements; the severity and pervasiveness of <br/>
the noncompliance, including the effect of the noncompliance on widespread interoperability and <br/>
health information exchange; the extent to which the health IT developer cooperates with ONC <br/>
to review the noncompliance; the extent of potential negative impact on providers who may seek <br/>
to use the certified health IT to participate in CMS programs; and whether termination and/or a <br/>
certification ban is necessary to ensure the integrity of the certification process.  <br/>
As under § 170.580(f)(2), ONC would provide notice of the termination to the health IT <br/>
developer, including providing reasons for, and information supporting, the termination and <br/>
instructions for appealing the termination. We propose to add similar notice provisions to § <br/>
170.581 for certification bans issued under ONC direct review for non-compliance with the <br/>
                                                 <br/>
100 Note that, in this example, an ONC-ACB may investigate the technical functionalities of the Health IT Module <br/>against its certificate and perform surveillance under § 170.556 separate from ONC’s process to enforce compliance <br/>with the Conditions of Certification. If under ONC-ACB surveillance, a health IT developer does not adequately or <br/>timely fulfill a corrective action plan, the ONC-ACB may suspend and withdraw the Health IT Module’s certificate. <br/>The expectations of ONC-ACB duties as relates to ONC’s enforcement of the conditions of certification are <br/>described further in the preamble. <br/>

requesting reinstatement. In this regard, we propose to apply the current reinstatement <br/>
procedures under § 170.581 to Conditions and Maintenance of Certification bans, but with an <br/>
additional requirement that the health IT developer has resolved the non-compliance with the <br/>
Condition of Certification. In sum, a health IT developer could seek ONC’s approval to re-enter <br/>
the Program and have the certification ban lifted if it demonstrates it has resolved the <br/>
noncompliance with the Condition of Certification and ONC is satisfied that all affected <br/>
customers have been provided appropriate remediation. <br/>
For clarity, a health IT developer would have an opportunity to appeal an ONC <br/>
determination to issue a certification ban and/or termination IT resulting from a non-conformity <br/>
with a Condition of Certification as discussed below and/or seek reinstatement in the Program <br/>
and have the certification ban lifted. To note, we propose to make terminations effective <br/>
consistent with current § 170.580(f)(2)(iii) and similarly for certification bans (<i>see</i> proposed § <br/>
170.581(c)). We seek comment on whether ONC should: <br/>
•  Impose a minimum certification ban length before a health IT developer can request <br/>
ONC remove the ban for health IT developers who are noncompliant with a Condition of <br/>
Certification more than once (e.g., a minimum six months for two instances, a minimum <br/>
of one year for three instances). <br/>
•  Consider additional factors for a certification ban and/or the termination of a health IT <br/>
developer’s certified health IT resulting from a non-conformity with a Condition of <br/>
Certification. <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to provide a health IT developer an opportunity to appeal an ONC <br/>
determination to issue a certification ban and/or termination resulting from a non-conformity <br/>
with a Condition of Certification and would follow the processes specified in § 170.580(g). As <br/>
such, we propose to revise § 170.580(g) to include ONC direct review of the Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
g. Suspension  <br/>
 <br/>
Section 170.580 includes a process for suspending the certification of a Health IT Module <br/>
at any time if ONC has a reasonable belief that the certified health IT may present a serious risk <br/>
to public health and safety. While this will remain the case for certified health IT under ONC <br/>
direct review (i.e., suspension of certification is always available under ONC direct review when <br/>
the certified health IT presents a serious risk to public health and safety), we do not believe such <br/>
circumstances would apply to noncompliance with the Conditions of Certification. Further, we <br/>
believe the more streamlined processes proposed for addressing noncompliance with Conditions <br/>
and Maintenance of Certification alleviates the need to proceed through a suspension process. <br/>
Therefore, we do not propose to apply the suspension processes under § 170.580 to our review of <br/>
the Conditions of Certification. We welcome comments on this proposal, including reasons for <br/>
why we should apply suspension processes to the Conditions of Certification as part of a <br/>
subsequent final rule. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
h. Proposed Termination <br/>
 <br/>
Section 170.580 includes an intermediate step between a developer failing to take <br/>
appropriate and timely corrective action and termination of a certified Health IT Module’s <br/>
certificate, called “proposed termination” (<i>see</i> § 170.580(e) and 81 FR 72437)). We propose to <br/>

 <br/>
<i>not</i> include this step when a health IT developer fails to take appropriate and timely corrective <br/>
action for noncompliance with a Condition of Certification. Rather, as discussed above, ONC <br/>
may proceed directly to issuing a certification ban or notice of termination if it determines a <br/>
certification ban and/or termination are appropriate per the considerations discussed above. The <br/>
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification include requirements of developer business <br/>
practices and actions for which, as previously discussed, noncompliance with the Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification in these arenas are likely to undermine the integrity of the Program <br/>
and impede widespread interoperability and information exchange. As such, ONC believes it is <br/>
appropriate and consistent with the Cures Act to proceed immediately to a certification ban <br/>
and/or termination of the affected certified Health IT Modules’ certificates if a developer does <br/>
not take appropriate and timely corrective action. A certification ban and/or termination are <br/>
appropriate disincentives for noncompliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification. <br/>
 <br/>
4. Public Listing of Certification Ban and Terminations <br/>
We propose to publicly list health IT developers and certified Health IT Modules on <br/>
ONC’s website that are subject to a certification ban and/or have been terminated, respectively, <br/>
for noncompliance with a Condition of Certification or for reasons already specified in § <br/>
170.581. We currently take this same approach for health IT with terminated certifications (<i>see</i> <br/>
81 FR 72438). Public listing serves to discourage noncompliance with Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification, other Program requirements, remediation of non-conformities, and <br/>
cooperation with ONC and the ONC-ACBs. It also serves to provide notice to all ONC-ATLs, <br/>
ONC-ACBs, public and private programs requiring the use of certified health IT, and consumers <br/>

of certified health IT of the status of certified health IT and health IT developers operating under <br/>
the Program.  <br/>
We seek comment on this proposal, including input on the appropriate period of time to <br/>
list health IT developers and affected certified Health IT Modules on healthit.gov. For example, <br/>
if a developer sought and received reinstatement under the Program (and lifting of the <br/>
certification ban), should the health IT developer no longer be listed on the ONC website? <br/>
Alternatively, should we list health IT developers who have been subject to the certification ban <br/>
under § 170.581 for a certain period of time beyond the active ban, including indefinitely (e.g., <br/>
with the timeframe when the ban was active)? <br/>

5. Effect on Existing Program Requirements and Processes <br/>
The Cures Act introduces new Conditions and Maintenance of Certification that <br/>
encompass technical and functional requirements of health IT and new actions and business <br/>
practice requirements for health IT developers, which ONC proposes to adopt in subpart D of <br/>
Part 170. The pre-Cures Act structure and requirements of the Program provide processes to <br/>
enforce compliance with technical and functional requirements of certified health IT, and to a <br/>

health IT to determine whether it conforms to the requirements of the Program (<i>see</i> § 170.580 <br/>
and the EOA final rule at 81 FR 72404). These avenues for investigating non-conformities with <br/>
certified Health IT Modules will continue to exist under the Program and generally focus on <br/>
functionality and performance of certified health IT or more limited requirements of business <br/>
practices of health IT developers found in subparts A, B, C and E of Part 170, respectively. Thus, <br/>
there may be instances where one or more Conditions and Maintenance of Certification are not <br/>
being or have not been met that also relate to certified Health IT Modules non-conformities <br/>
under subparts A, B, C and E. Under these situations, ONC could in parallel implement both sets <br/>
of processes – existing processes to investigate Health IT Module non-conformities and the <br/>
proposed process to enforce compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification.  <br/>
We again note that under the proposed enforcement approach, only ONC would have the <br/>
ability to determine whether a Condition or Maintenance of Certification requirement per subpart <br/>
D has been or is being met. We propose to delineate the scope of an ONC-ACB’s requirements <br/>
to perform surveillance on certified Health IT Modules as related only to the requirements of <br/>
subparts A, B, C and E of Part 170. Table 4 below further illustrates the proposed difference in <br/>
scope of review activities between ONC-ACBs and ONC. Given our proposed approach that <br/>
would authorize solely ONC to determine whether a Condition or Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirement per subpart D has been or is being met, we propose to add a new Principle of Proper <br/>
Conduct for ONC-ACBs in § 170.523(s) that would require ONC-ACBs to report to ONC, no <br/>
later than a week after becoming aware, any information that could inform whether ONC should <br/>
exercise direct review for noncompliance with a Condition of Certification or any matter within <br/>
the scope of ONC direct review. We believe this is appropriate because ONC-ACBs receive <br/>

health IT drops the incoming message without alerting the user that a message was ever received. <br/>
ONC would consider the information blocking concerns (proposed § 170.401) as well as the <br/>
potential safety concerns presented by dropped messages associated with certified functionality <br/>

exercising its authority to review certified health IT that may be causing or contributing to <br/>
conditions that present a serious risk to public health or safety under § 170.580(a)(2)(i). In <br/>
contrast, the ONC-ACB would not be responsible for reviewing the information blocking or <br/>
safety concerns directly, but it <i>would </i>be responsible for assessing whether surveillance needs to <br/>
be performed on the certified health IT for the functionality in the 2015 Edition “transitions of <br/>
care” certification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)) and the 2015 Edition “Direct Project” certification <br/>
criterion (§ 170.315(h)(1)), as these requirements are found within subpart C of Part 170 and <br/>
could be implicated based on the complaint. <br/>
To provide another example, an ONC-ACB could receive complaints from users that a <br/>
developer’s certified health IT does not support the FHIR DSTU 2 standard and associated API <br/>
resource collection in health (ARCH Version 1) as required in the proposed new 2015 Edition <br/>
certification criterion § 170.315(g)(10) (proposed under subparts B and C).The respective ONC-<br/>
ACB(s) responsible for the certification of the certified health IT could surveil this health IT <br/>
under the requirements of § 170.556 (under subpart E). Additionally, ONC could follow the CAP <br/>
process under § 170.580(c) to enforce the associated “API” Condition of Certification proposed <br/>
in § 170.404(a)(2). During the course of the ONC-ACB surveillance, the ONC-ACB <br/>
subsequently discovers the developer has implemented the FHIR DSTU 2 standard and <br/>
associated resources in such as a way that the patient’s historical medications are being accessed, <br/>
but not the patient’s current medications. The ONC-ACB would notify ONC of its findings as it <br/>
relates to a Condition of Certification under subpart D and pursue its own corrective action <br/>
process under the surveillance requirements of § 170.556. Once ONC receives information <br/>
regarding the complaints from the ONC-ACB, we could consider the potential safety risks for <br/>

providers using the developer’s API to access new or referred patients’ medical information for <br/>
diagnostic and treatment purposes. In this example, ONC could review both the certified health <br/>
IT and the developer action under § 170.580, which is proposed to be expanded to account for <br/>
developer actions under the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification (<i>see </i>proposed § <br/>
170.580(a)(2)(iii)) in addition to ONC’s direct investigation of certified health IT for potential <br/>
safety risks (<i>see</i> § 170.580(a)(2)(i)).  <br/>
 <br/>
6. Concurrent Enforcement by the Office of Inspector General <br/>
We clarify that the enforcement approach described in this proposal would apply to <br/>
ONC’s administration of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification and other <br/>
requirements under the Program but would not apply to other agencies or offices that have <br/>
independent authority to investigate and take enforcement action against a health IT developer of <br/>
certified health IT. Notably, section 3022(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the PHSA, as added by the Cures Act, <br/>
authorizes the OIG to investigate claims that a health IT developer of certified health IT has <br/>
engaged in information blocking, which is defined by section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA subject to <br/>
reasonable and necessary activities identified by the Secretary as exceptions to the definition as <br/>
proposed at part 171 (see section VIII. of this proposed rule). Additionally, section <br/>
3022(b)(1)(A)(i) authorizes OIG to investigate claims that a health IT developer of certified <br/>
health IT has submitted a false attestation under the Condition of Certification described at <br/>
section 3001(c)(5)(D)(vii). We emphasize that ONC’s and OIG’s respective authorities under the <br/>
Cures Act (and in general) are independent and that either or both offices may exercise those <br/>
authorities at any time.  <br/>

 <br/>
We anticipate, however, that ONC and OIG may coordinate their respective enforcement <br/>
activities, as appropriate, such as by sharing information about claims or suggestions of possible <br/>
information blocking or false attestations (including violations of Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification that may indicate that a developer has falsely attested to meeting a condition). <br/>
Therefore, we propose that we may coordinate our review of a claim of information blocking <br/>
with the OIG or defer to the OIG to lead a review of a claim of information blocking. In addition, <br/>
we propose that we may rely on OIG findings to form the basis of a direct review action. <br/>
7. Applicability of Conditions and Maintenance of Certification Requirements for Self-<br/>
Developers <br/>
The final rule establishing ONC’s Permanent Certification Program, “Establishment of <br/>
the Permanent Certification for Health Information” (76 FR 1261), addresses self-developers. <br/>
The language in the final rule describes the concept of “self-developed” as referring to a <br/>
Complete EHR or EHR Module designed, created, or modified by an entity that assumed the <br/>
total costs for testing and certification and that will be the primary user of the health IT (76 FR <br/>
1300). Therefore, self-developers differ from other health IT developers in that their products are <br/>
not made commercially available and they do not have customers. While we propose that all <br/>
general Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements apply to such developers, we <br/>
also seek comment on which <i>aspects</i> of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
requirements may not be applicable to self-developers. For example, when considering the <br/>
Communications Condition of Certification, a self-developer of health IT may not have customer <br/>
contracts, but could have other agreements in place, such as NDAs, that would be subject to the <br/>
Condition of Certification. <br/>

<b>VIII. Information Blocking </b><br/>
<i>A. Statutory Basis </i><br/>
 <br/>
Section 4004 of the Cures Act added section 3022 of the PHSA (42 U.S.C. 300jj–52,<b> </b>“the <br/>
information blocking provision”). Section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA defines practices that <br/>
constitute information blocking when engaged in by a health care provider, or a health <br/>
information technology developer, exchange, or network. Section 3022(a)(3) authorizes the <br/>
Secretary to identify, through notice and comment rulemaking, reasonable and necessary <br/>
activities that do not constitute information blocking for purposes of the definition set forth in <br/>
section 3022(a)(1). We propose to establish seven exceptions to the information blocking <br/>
definition, each of which would define certain activities that would not constitute information <br/>
blocking for purposes of section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA because they are reasonable and <br/>
necessary to further the ultimate policy goals of the information blocking provision. We also <br/>
propose to interpret or define certain statutory terms and concepts that are ambiguous, <br/>
incomplete, or provide the Secretary with discretion, and that we believe are necessary to carry <br/>
out the Secretary’s rulemaking responsibilities under section 3022(a)(3). <br/>
<i>B. Legislative Background and Policy Considerations  </i><br/>
 <br/>
In this section, we outline the purpose of the information blocking provision and related <br/>
policy and practical considerations that we considered in identifying the reasonable and <br/>
necessary activities that are proposed as exceptions to the definition of information blocking <br/>
described subsequently in section VIII.D of this preamble.     <br/>

The information blocking provision was enacted in response to concerns that some <br/>
individuals and entities are engaging in practices that unreasonably limit the availability and use <br/>
of electronic health information (EHI) for authorized and permitted purposes. These practices <br/>
undermine public and private sector investments in the nation’s health IT infrastructure and <br/>
frustrate efforts to use modern technologies to improve health care quality and efficiency, <br/>
accelerate research and innovation, and provide greater value and choice to health care <br/>
consumers. <br/>
 <br/>
The nature and extent of information blocking has come into sharp focus in recent years. <br/>
In 2015, at the request of Congress, we submitted a Report on Health Information Blocking<a href="ONCs.html#325">101</a> <br/>
(“Information Blocking Congressional Report”), in which we commented on the then current <br/>
state of technology and of health IT and health care markets. Notably, we observed that <br/>
prevailing market conditions create incentives for some individuals and entities to exercise their <br/>
control over EHI in ways that limit its availability and use.  <br/>
Since that time, we have continued to receive complaints and reports of information <br/>
blocking from patients, clinicians, health care executives, payers, app developers and other <br/>
technology companies, registries and health information exchanges, professional and trade <br/>
associations, and many other stakeholders. ONC has listened to and reviewed these complaints <br/>
and reports, consulted with stakeholders, and solicited input from our federal partners in order to <br/>
inform our proposed information blocking policies. Stakeholders described discriminatory <br/>
pricing policies that have the obvious purpose and effect of excluding competitors from the use <br/>

of interoperability elements. Many of the industry stakeholders who shared their perspectives <br/>
with us in listening sessions, including several health IT developers of certified health IT, <br/>
condemned these practices and urged us to swiftly address them. Our engagement with <br/>
stakeholders confirms that, despite significant public and private sector efforts to improve <br/>
interoperability and data accessibility, adverse incentives remain and continue to undermine <br/>
progress toward a more connected health system.  <br/>
Based on these economic realities and our first-hand experience working with the health <br/>
IT industry and stakeholders, in the Information Blocking Congressional Report, we concluded <br/>
that information blocking is a serious problem and recommended that Congress prohibit <br/>
information blocking and provide penalties and enforcement mechanisms to deter these harmful <br/>
practices.  <br/>
 <br/>
Recent empirical and economic research further underscores the intractability of this <br/>
problem and its harmful effects. In a national survey of health information organizations, half of <br/>
respondents reported that EHR developers routinely engage in information blocking, and a <br/>
quarter of respondents reported that hospitals and health systems routinely do so. The survey <br/>
reported that perceived motivations for such conduct included, for EHR vendors, maximizing <br/>
short-term revenue and competing for new clients, and for hospitals and health systems, <br/>
strengthening their competitive position relative to other hospitals and health systems.<a href="ONCs.html#326">102 </a>Other <br/>
research suggests that these practices weaken competition among health care providers by <br/>
limiting patient mobility, encouraging consolidation, and creating barriers to entry for developers <br/>

The information blocking provision provides a comprehensive response to these <br/>
concerns. The information blocking provision defines and creates possible penalties and <br/>
disincentives for information blocking in broad terms, while working to deter the entire spectrum <br/>
of practices that unnecessarily impede the flow of EHI or its use to improve health and the <br/>
delivery of care. The information blocking provision applies to the conduct of health care <br/>
providers, and to health IT developers of certified health IT, exchanges, and networks, and seeks <br/>
to deter it with substantial penalties, including civil money penalties, and disincentives for <br/>
violations. Additionally, developers of health IT certified under the Program are prohibited from <br/>
information blocking under 3001(c)(5)(D)(i) of the PHSA. To promote effective enforcement, <br/>
the information blocking provision empowers the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) to <br/>
investigate claims of information blocking and provides referral processes to facilitate <br/>
coordination with other relevant agencies, including ONC, the HHS Office for Civil Rights <br/>
(OCR), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The information blocking provision also <br/>
provides for a complaint process and corresponding confidentiality protections to encourage and <br/>
facilitate the reporting of information blocking. Enforcement of the information blocking <br/>
provision is buttressed by section 3001(c)(5)(D)(i) and (vi) of the PHSA, which prohibits <br/>

information blocking by developers of certified health IT as a Condition and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification requirement under the Program and requires them to attest that they have not <br/>
engaged in such practices.  <br/>
 <br/>
2. Policy Considerations and Approach to the Information Blocking Provision  <br/>
 <br/>
To ensure that individuals and entities that engage in information blocking are held <br/>
accountable, the information blocking provision encompasses a relatively broad range of <br/>
potential practices. For example, it is possible that some activities that are innocuous, or even <br/>
beneficial, could technically implicate the information blocking provision. Given the possibility <br/>
of these practices, Congress authorized the Secretary to identify reasonable and necessary <br/>
activities that do not constitute information blocking (see section 3022(a)(3) of the PHSA) (in <br/>
this proposed rule, we refer to such reasonable and necessary activities identified by the <br/>
Secretary as “exceptions” to the information blocking provision). The information blocking <br/>
provision also excludes from the definition of information blocking practices that are required by <br/>
law (section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA) and clarifies certain other practices that would not be <br/>
penalized (sections 3022(a)(6) and (7) of the PHSA).  <br/>
In considering potential exceptions to the information blocking provision, we must <br/>
balance a number of policy and practical considerations. To minimize compliance and other <br/>
burdens for stakeholders, we seek to promote policies that are clear, predictable, and <br/>
administrable. In addition, we seek to implement the information blocking provision in a way <br/>
that is sensitive to legitimate practical challenges that may prevent access, exchange, or use of <br/>
EHI in certain situations. We must also accommodate practices that, while they may inhibit <br/>
access, exchange, or use of EHI, are reasonable and necessary to advance other compelling <br/>

 <br/>
policy interests, such as preventing harm to patients and others, promoting the privacy and <br/>
security of EHI, and promoting competition and consumer welfare.  <br/>
 <br/>
At the same time, while pursuing these objectives, we must adhere to Congress’s plainly <br/>
expressed intent to provide a comprehensive response to the information blocking problem. <br/>
Information blocking can occur through a variety of business, technical, and organizational <br/>
practices that can be difficult to detect and that are constantly changing as technology and <br/>
industry conditions evolve. The statute responds to these challenges by defining information <br/>
blocking broadly and in a manner that allows for careful consideration of relevant facts and <br/>
circumstances in individual cases.   <br/>
 <br/>
Accordingly, we propose to establish certain defined exceptions to the information <br/>
blocking provision. These exceptions would be subject to strict conditions that balance the <br/>
considerations described above. Based on those considerations, in developing the proposed <br/>
exceptions, we applied three overarching policy criteria. First, each exception would be limited <br/>
to certain activities that are both reasonable and necessary to advance the aims of the information <br/>
blocking provision. These reasonable and necessary activities include: promoting public <br/>
confidence in the health IT infrastructure by supporting the privacy and security of EHI, and <br/>
protecting patient safety; and promoting competition and innovation in health IT and its use to <br/>
provide health care services to consumers. Second, we believe that each exception addresses a <br/>
significant risk that regulated individuals and entities will not engage in these reasonable and <br/>
necessary activities because of uncertainty regarding the breadth or applicability of the <br/>
information blocking provision. Third, and last, each exception is intended to be tailored, <br/>
through appropriate conditions, so that it is limited to the reasonable and necessary activities that <br/>

it is designed to protect and does not extend protection to other activities or practices that could <br/>
raise information blocking concerns.   <br/>
We discuss these policy considerations in more detail in the context of each of the <br/>
exceptions proposed in section VIII.D of this preamble.  <br/>
<i>C. Relevant Statutory Terms and Provisions </i><br/>
 <br/>
In this section of the preamble, we discuss how we propose to interpret certain aspects of <br/>
the information blocking provision that we believe are ambiguous, incomplete, or that provide <br/>
the Secretary with discretion. We propose to define or interpret certain terms or concepts that are <br/>
present in the statute and, in a few instances, to establish new regulatory terms or definitions that <br/>
we believe are necessary to implement the Secretary’s authority under section 3022(a)(3) to <br/>
identify reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking. Our goal <br/>
in interpreting the statute and defining relevant terms is to provide greater clarity concerning the <br/>
types of practices that could implicate the information blocking provision and, relatedly, to more <br/>
effectively communicate the applicability and scope of the proposed exceptions outlined in this <br/>
proposed rule. We believe that these proposals will provide a more meaningful opportunity for <br/>
the public to comment on the proposed exceptions and our overall approach to interpreting and <br/>
administering the information blocking provision. Additionally, we believe additional <br/>
interpretive clarity will assist regulated actors to comply with the requirements of the <br/>
information blocking provision.  <br/>
1.  “Required by Law” <br/>
With regard to the statute’s exclusion of practices that are “required by law” from the <br/>
definition of information blocking, we emphasize that “required by law” refers specifically to <br/>

 <br/>
interferences with access, exchange, or use of EHI that are explicitly required by state or federal <br/>
law. By carving out practices that are “required by law,” the statute acknowledged that there are <br/>
state and federal laws that advance important policy interests and objectives by restricting access, <br/>
exchange, and use of their EHI, and that practices that follow such laws should not be considered <br/>
information blocking.  <br/>
We note that for the purpose of developing an exception for reasonable and necessary <br/>
privacy-protective practices, we have distinguished between interferences that are “required by <br/>
law” and those engaged in pursuant to a privacy law, but which are not “required by law.” The <br/>
former does not fall within the definition of information blocking, but the latter may implicate <br/>
the information blocking provision and an exception may be necessary. For a detailed discussion <br/>
of this topic, please see section VIII.D.2 of this preamble. <br/>
2. Health Care Providers, Health IT Developers, Exchanges, and Networks <br/>
 <br/>
Section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA, in defining information blocking, refers to four classes <br/>
of individuals and entities that may engage in information blocking and which include: health <br/>
care providers, health IT developers of certified health IT, networks, and exchanges. We propose <br/>
to adopt definitions of these terms to provide clarity regarding the types of individuals and <br/>
entities to whom the information blocking provision applies. We note that, for convenience and <br/>
to avoid repetition in this preamble, we typically refer to these individuals and entities covered <br/>
by the information blocking provision as “actors” unless it is relevant or useful to refer to the <br/>
specific type of individual or entity. That is, when the term “actor” appears in this preamble, it <br/>
means an individual or entity that is a health care provider, health IT developer, exchange, or <br/>
network. For the same reasons, we propose to define “actor” in § 171.102. <br/>

 <br/>
a. Health Care Providers <br/>
 <br/>
The term “health care provider” is defined in section 3000(3) of the PHSA. We propose <br/>
to adopt this definition for purposes of section 3022 of the PHSA when defining “health care <br/>
provider” in § 171.102. We note that this definition is different from the definition of “health <br/>
care provider” under the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. We are considering adjusting the <br/>
information blocking definition of “health care provider” to cover all individuals and entities <br/>
covered by the HIPAA “health care provider” definition. We seek comment on whether this <br/>
approach would be justified, and commenters are encouraged to specify reasons why doing so <br/>
might be necessary to ensure that the information blocking provision applies to all health care <br/>
providers that might engage in information blocking. <br/>
b. Health IT Developers of Certified Health IT <br/>
Section 3022(a)(1)(B) of the PHSA defines information blocking, in part, by reference to <br/>
the conduct of “health information technology developers.” Because title XXX of the PHSA <br/>
does not define “health information technology developer,” we interpret section 3022(a)(1)(B) in <br/>
light of the specific authority provided to OIG in section 3022(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2). Section <br/>
3022(b)(2) discusses developers, networks, and exchanges in terms of an “individual or entity,” <br/>
specifically cross-referencing section 3022(b)(1)(A). Sections 3002(b)(1) and (b)(1)(A) state, in <br/>
relevant part, that the OIG may investigate information blocking claims regarding a health <br/>
information technology developer of certified health information technology or other entity <br/>
offering certified health information technology. Together, these sections make clear that the <br/>
information blocking provisions and OIG’s authority extend to individuals <i>or</i> entities that <br/>
develop <i>or</i> offer certified health IT. That the individual or entity must develop or offer <i>certified</i> <br/>

health IT is further supported by section 3022(a)(7) of the PHSA—which refers to developers’ <br/>
responsibilities to meet the requirements of certification—and section 4002 of the Cures Act—<br/>
which identifies information blocking as a Condition of Certification.  <br/>
Notwithstanding this, the Cures Act does not prescribe that conduct that may implicate <br/>
the information blocking provisions be limited to practices related to <i>only</i> certified health IT. <br/>
Rather, the information blocking provisions would be implicated by any practice engaged in by <br/>
an individual or entity that develops or offers certified health IT that is likely to interfere with the <br/>
access, exchange, or use of EHI, including practices associated with <i>any</i> of the developer or <br/>
offeror’s health IT products that have <i>not </i>been certified under the Program. This interpretation is <br/>
based primarily on section 3022(b)(1) of the PHSA. If Congress had intended that the <br/>
enforcement of the information blocking provisions were limited to practices connected to <br/>
certified health IT, we believe the Cures Act would have included language that tied enforcement <br/>
to the operation or performance of a product certified under the Program. Rather, the description <br/>
of the practices that OIG can investigate in section 3022(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the PHSA are not tied to <br/>
the certification status of the health IT at issue, omitting any express reference to a health IT <br/>
developer’s practice needing to be related to “certified health information technology.” That the <br/>
scope of the information blocking provision should not be limited to practices that involve only <br/>
certified health IT is further evidenced by no such limitation applying to health care providers, <br/>
health information exchanges (HIEs), and health information networks (HINs) as listed in <br/>
sections 3022(b)(1) of the PHSA.  <br/>
Additionally, the “practice described” in section 3022(a)(2) of the PHSA refers to <br/>
“certified health information technologies” when illustrating practices that restrict authorized <br/>

access, exchange, or use of EHI under applicable state or federal laws (section 3022(a)(2)(A) of <br/>
the PHSA), but omits any reference to certification when describing “health information <br/>
technology” in the practices described in sections 3022(a)(2)(B) and (C) of the PHSA. <br/>
Importantly, sections 3022(a)(2)(B) and (C) of the PHSA address practices that are particularly <br/>
relevant to health IT developers and offerors, although they could be engaged in by other types <br/>
of actors. We interpret this drafting as a deliberate decision not to link the information blocking <br/>
provisions with only the performance or use of certified health IT. <br/>
Finally, we note that the Cures Act does not impose a temporal nexus that would require <br/>
that information blocking be carried out at a time when an individual or entity had health IT <br/>
certified under the Program. Ostensibly, then, once an individual or entity has health IT certified, <br/>
or otherwise maintains the certification of health IT, the individual or entity becomes forever <br/>
subject to the information blocking provision. We do not believe that, understood in context, the <br/>
Cures Act supports such a broad interpretation. Noting the above discussion concerning OIG’s <br/>
scope of authority under section 3022(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2) of the PHSA, we believe that to make <br/>
developers and offerors of certified health IT subject to the information blocking provision in <br/>
perpetuity would be inconsistent with the voluntary nature of the Program. However, we also <br/>
believe that the Cures Act does not provide any basis for interpreting the information blocking <br/>
provision so narrowly that a developer or offeror of certified health IT could escape penalty as a <br/>
consequence of having its certification terminated or by withdrawing all of its extant <br/>
certifications.  <br/>
We consider that in the circumstances where a health IT developer has its certification <br/>
terminated, or withdraws its certification, such that it no longer has any health IT certified under <br/>

the Program, it should nonetheless be subject to penalties for information blocking engaged in <br/>
during the time that it did have health IT certified under the Program. Accordingly, we propose <br/>
to adopt a definition of “heath information technology (IT) developer of certified health IT” for <br/>
the purposes of interpretation and enforcement of the information blocking provisions, including <br/>
those regulatory provisions proposed under Title 45, part 171, of the Code of Federal <br/>
Regulations, that would capture such developers or offerors. We propose, in § 171.102, that <br/>
“health IT developer of certified health IT” means an individual or entity that develops or offers <br/>
health information technology (as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. 300jj(5)) and which had, at <br/>
the time it engaged in a practice that is the subject of an information blocking claim, health IT <br/>
(one or more) certified under the Program. To note, we propose that the term “information <br/>
blocking claim” within this definition should be read broadly to encompass any statement of <br/>
information blocking or potential information blocking. “Claims” of information blocking within <br/>
this definition would not be limited, in any way, to a specific form, format, or submission <br/>
approach or process.  <br/>
We are also considering additional approaches to help ensure that developers and offerors <br/>
of certified health IT remain subject to the information blocking provision for an appropriate <br/>
period of time after leaving the Program. The rationale for this approach would be that a <br/>
developer or offeror of certified health IT should be subject to penalties if, following the <br/>
termination or withdrawal of certification, it refused to provide its customers with access to the <br/>
EHI stored in the decertified health IT, provided that such interference was not required by law <br/>
and did not qualify for one of the information blocking exceptions. Adopting this broader <br/>
approach would help avoid the risk that a developer would be able to engage in the practices <br/>

described in section 3022(a)(2) of the PHSA in respect to EHI that was collected on behalf of a <br/>
health care provider when that health care provider would reasonably expect that the information <br/>
blocking provision would protect against unreasonable and unnecessary interferences with that <br/>
EHI. If the information blocking provision did not extend to capture such conduct, the protection <br/>
afforded by the information blocking provision could become illusory, and providers would need <br/>
to consider securing contractual rights to prevent interference, which we are aware they typically <br/>
have great difficulty doing.<a href="ONCs.html#336">104</a>  <br/>
One way that this could be achieved would be to define “health IT developer of certified <br/>
health IT” as including developers and offerors of certified health IT that continue to store EHI <br/>
that was previously stored in health IT certified in the Program. Alternatively, we are considering <br/>
whether developers and offerors of certified health IT should remain subject to the information <br/>
blocking provision for an appropriate period of time after leaving the Program. Namely, that the <br/>
information blocking provision should apply for a specific time period, say one year, after the <br/>
developer or offeror no longer has any health IT certified in the Program. This second approach <br/>
has the attraction of providing a more certain basis for understanding which developers are <br/>
subject to the information blocking provision. However, it also potentially captures developers <br/>
and offerors who have fully removed themselves from the Program and, for example, no longer <br/>
exercise control over EHI that was stored in their certified health IT.  <br/>
We seek comment on which of these two models best achieves our policy goal of <br/>
ensuring that health IT developers of certified health IT will face consequences under the <br/>

information blocking provision if they engage in information blocking in connection with EHI <br/>
that was stored or controlled by the developer or offeror whilst they were participating in the <br/>
program. Commenters are also encouraged to identify alternative models and approaches for <br/>
identifying when a developer or offeror should, and should no longer, be subject to the <br/>
information blocking provision. <br/>
We note that a developer or offeror of a single health IT product that has had its <br/>
certification suspended would be considered to <i>have</i> certified health IT for the purpose of the <br/>
definition. We also note that we interpret the requirement that the health IT developer of certified <br/>
health IT “exercise control” over EHI broadly. A developer would not necessarily need to have <br/>
access to the EHI in order to exercise control. For example, a developer that implemented a “kill-<br/>
switch” for a decertified software product that was locally hosted by a health care provider, <br/>
preventing that provider from accessing its records, would be exercising control over the EHI for <br/>
the purpose of this definition. <br/>
We clarify that we interpret “individual or entity that develops the certified health IT” as <br/>
the individual or entity that is legally responsible for the certification status of the health IT, <br/>
which would be the individual or entity that entered into a binding agreement that resulted in the <br/>
certification status of the health IT under the Program or, if such rights are transferred, the <br/>
individual or entity that holds the rights to the certified health IT. We also clarify that an <br/>
“individual or entity that offers certified health IT” would include an individual or entity that <br/>
under any arrangement makes certified health IT available for purchase or license. We seek <br/>
comment on both of our interpretations. More specifically, we seek comment on whether there <br/>
are particular types of arrangements under which certified health IT is “offered” in which the <br/>

the information blocking provisions. <br/>
We also clarify that the proposed definition of “health IT developer of certified health IT” <br/>
and our interpretation of the use of “health information technology developer” applies to Part <br/>
171 only and does not apply to the implementation of any other section of the PHSA or the Cures <br/>
Act, including section 4005(c)(1) of the Cures Act. <br/>
We clarify that API Technology Suppliers, as described in section VII.4 of this preamble <br/>
and defined in § 170.102, would be considered health IT developers of certified health IT subject <br/>
to the conditions described above. <br/>

the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program) and described in this rulemaking (section <br/>
VII.D.7) and previous rulemaking<a href="ONCs.html#338">105, </a>would be treated as a health care provider for the purposes <br/>

purposes<a href="ONCs.html#338">106</a> would essentially mean that such developers would not be supplying or offering their <br/>
certified health IT to other entities. To be clear, self-developers would still be subject to the <br/>
proposed Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements because they have health IT <br/>
certified under the Program (<i>see also</i> section VII.D.7). We welcome comments on our <br/>
determination regarding “self-developers” for information blocking purposes and whether there <br/>
                                                 <br/>
105 The final rule establishing ONC’s Permanent Certification Program, “Establishment of the Permanent <br/>Certification for Health Information” (76 FR 1261), addresses self-developers.  <br/>106 The language in the final rule describes the concept of “self-developed” as referring to a complete EHR or EHR <br/>Module designed, created, or modified by an entity that assumed the total costs for testing and certification and that <br/>will be the primary user of the health IT (76 FR 1300). <br/> <br/>

are other factors we should consider in how we treat “self-developers” of certified health IT for <br/>
the purposes of information blocking. <br/>
We also seek comment generally on the definition proposed for “health IT developer of <br/>
certified health IT.”  <br/>
c. Networks and Exchanges <br/>
 <br/>
The terms “network” and “exchange” are not defined in the information blocking <br/>
provision or in any other relevant statutory provisions. We propose to define these terms so that <br/>
these individuals and entities that are covered by the information blocking provision understand <br/>
that they must comply with its provisions. In accordance with the meaning and intent of the <br/>
information blocking provision, we believe it is necessary to define these terms in a way that <br/>
does not assume the application or use of certain technologies and is flexible enough to apply to <br/>
the full range and diversity of exchanges and networks that exist today and may arise in the <br/>
future. We note that in the past few years alone many new types of exchanges and networks that <br/>
transmit EHI have emerged, and we expect this trend to accelerate with continued advancements <br/>
in technology and renewed efforts to advance trusted exchange among networks and other <br/>
entities under the trusted exchange framework and common agreement provided for by section <br/>
4003(b) of the Cures Act.  <br/>
 <br/>
In considering the most appropriate way to define these terms, we examined how they are <br/>
used throughout the Cures Act and the HITECH Act. Additionally, we considered dictionary and <br/>
industry definitions of “network” and “exchange.” While these terms have varied usage and <br/>
meaning in different industry contexts, certain concepts are common and have been incorporated <br/>
into the proposed definitions below.  <br/>

i. Health Information Network <br/>
We propose a functional definition of “health information network” (HIN) that focuses <br/>
on the role of these actors in the health information ecosystem. We believe the defining attribute <br/>
of a HIN is that it enables, facilitates, or controls the movement of information between or <br/>
among different individuals or entities that are unaffiliated. For this purpose, we propose that two <br/>
parties are affiliated if one has the power to control the other, or if both parties are under the <br/>
common control or ownership of a common owner. We note that a significant implication of this <br/>
definition is that a health care provider or other entity that enables, facilitates, or controls the <br/>
movement of EHI within its own organization, or between or among its affiliated entities, is not a <br/>
HIN in connection with that movement of information for the purposes of this proposed rule.   <br/>
More affirmatively, we propose that an actor could be considered a HIN if it performs <br/>
any or any combination of the following activities. First, the actor would be a HIN if it were to <br/>
determine, oversee, administer, control, or substantially influence policies or agreements that <br/>
define the business, operational, technical, or other conditions or requirements that enable or <br/>
facilitate the access, exchange, or use of EHI between or among two or more unaffiliated <br/>
individuals or entities. Second, an actor would be a HIN if it were to provide, manage, control, or <br/>
substantially influence any technology or service that enables or facilitates the access, exchange, <br/>
or use of EHI between or among two or more unaffiliated individuals or entities.  <br/>
Typically, a HIN will influence the sharing of EHI between many unaffiliated individuals <br/>
or entities. However, we do not propose to establish any minimum number of parties or “nodes” <br/>
beyond the requirement that there be some actual or contemplated access, exchange, or use of <br/>
information between or among at least two unaffiliated individuals or entities that is enabled, <br/>

facilitated, or controlled by the HIN. We believe such a limitation would be artificial and would <br/>
not capture the full range of entities that should be considered networks under the information <br/>
blocking provision. To be clear, any individual or entity that enables, facilitates, or controls the <br/>
access, exchange, or use of EHI between or among only itself and another unaffiliated individual <br/>
or entity would not be considered a HIN in connection with the movement of that EHI (although <br/>
that movement of EHI may still be regulated under the information blocking provision on the <br/>
basis that the individual or entity is a health care provider or health IT developer of certified <br/>
health IT). To be a HIN, the individual or entity would need to be enabling, facilitating, or <br/>
controlling the access, exchange, or use of EHI between or among two or more <i>other</i> individuals <br/>
or entities that were not affiliated with it. <br/>
To illustrate how the proposed definition would operate, we note the following examples. <br/>
An entity is established within a state for the purpose of improving the movement of EHI <br/>
between the health care providers operating in that state. The entity identifies standards relating <br/>
to security and offers terms and conditions to be entered into by health care providers wishing to <br/>
participate in the network. The entity offering (and then overseeing and administering) the terms <br/>
and conditions for participation in the network would be considered a HIN for the purpose of the <br/>
information blocking provision. We note that there is no need for a separate entity to be created <br/>
in order that an entity be considered a HIN. For instance, a health system that administers <br/>
business and operational agreements for facilitating the exchange of EHI that are adhered to by <br/>
unaffiliated family practices and specialist clinicians in order to streamline referrals between <br/>
those practices and specialists would likely be considered a HIN.     <br/>

 <br/>
We note that the proposed definition would also encompass an individual or entity that <br/>
does not directly enable, facilitate, or control the movement of information, but nonetheless <br/>
exercises control or substantial influence over the policies, technology, or services of a network. <br/>
In particular, there may be an individual or entity that relies on another entity—such as an entity <br/>
specifically created for the purpose of managing a network—for policies and technology, but <br/>
nevertheless dictates the movement of EHI over that network. For example, a large health care <br/>
provider may decide to lead an effort to establish a network that facilitates the movement of EHI <br/>
between a group of smaller health care providers (as well as the large health care provider) and <br/>
through the technology of health IT developers. To achieve this outcome, the large health care <br/>
provider, together with some of the participants, creates a new entity that administers the <br/>
network’s policies and technology. In this scenario, the large health care provider would come <br/>
within the functional definition of a HIN and could be held accountable for the conduct of the <br/>
network if the large health care provider used its control or substantial influence over the new <br/>
entity—either in a legal sense, such as via its control over the governance or management of the <br/>
entity, or in a less formal sense, such as if the large health care provider prescribed a policy to be <br/>
adopted—to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI. We note that the large health <br/>
care provider in this example would be treated as a health care provider when utilizing the <br/>
network to move EHI via the network’s policies, technology, or services, but would be <br/>
considered a HIN in connection with the practices of the network over which the large health <br/>
care provider exercises control or substantial influence. <br/>
We seek comment on the proposed definition of a HIN. In particular, we request <br/>
comment on whether the proposed definition is broad enough (or too broad) to cover the full <br/>

range of individuals and entities that could be considered health information networks within the <br/>
meaning of the information blocking provision. Additionally, we specifically request comment <br/>
on whether the proposed definition would effectuate our policy goal of defining this term in a <br/>
way that does not assume particular technologies or arrangements and is flexible enough to <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
ii. Health Information Exchange <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to define a “health information exchange” (HIE) as an individual or entity <br/>
that enables access, exchange, or use of EHI primarily between or among a particular class of <br/>
individuals or entities or for a limited set of purposes. Our research and experience in working <br/>
with exchanges drove the proposed definition of this term. HIEs include but are not limited to <br/>
regional health information organizations (RHIOs), state health information exchanges (state <br/>
HIEs), and other types of organizations, entities, or arrangements that enable EHI to be accessed, <br/>
exchanged, or used between or among particular types of parties or for particular purposes. For <br/>
example, an HIE might facilitate or enable the access, exchange, or use of EHI exclusively <br/>
within a regional area (such as a RHIO), or for a limited scope of participants and purposes (such <br/>
as a clinical data registry or an exchange established by a hospital-physician organization to <br/>
facilitate Admission, Discharge, and Transfer (ADT) alerting). We note that HIEs may be <br/>
established under federal or state laws or regulations but may also be established for specific <br/>
health care or business purposes or use cases. Additionally, we note that if an HIE facilitates the <br/>
access, exchange, or use of EHI for more than a narrowly defined set of purposes, then it may be <br/>
both an HIE and a HIN.    <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
We seek comment on this proposed definition of an HIE. Again, we encourage <br/>
commenters to consider whether this proposed definition is broad enough (or too broad) to cover <br/>
the full range of individuals and entities that could be considered exchanges within the meaning <br/>
of the information blocking provision, and whether the proposed definition is sufficiently <br/>
flexible to accommodate changing technological and other conditions.  <br/>
 <br/>
3. Electronic Health Information <br/>
 <br/>
The definition of information blocking applies to <i>electronic </i>health information (EHI) <br/>
(section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA). While section 3000(4) of the PHSA by reference to section <br/>
1171(4) of the Social Security Act defines “health information,” EHI is not specifically defined <br/>
in the Cures Act, HITECH Act, or other relevant statutes. We propose to define EHI to mean: <br/>
(i) electronic protected health information; and  <br/>
(ii) any other information that –     <br/>
•  is transmitted by or maintained in electronic media, as defined in 45 CFR § 160.103; <br/>
•  identifies the individual, or with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the <br/>
information can be used to identify the individual; and  <br/>
•  relates to the past, present, or future health or condition of an individual; the provision of <br/>
health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health <br/>
care to an individual. <br/>
This definition of EHI includes, but is not limited to, electronic protected health <br/>
information and health information that is created or received by a health care provider and those <br/>
operating on their behalf; health plan; health care clearinghouse; public health authority; <br/>
employer; life insurer; school; or university. In addition, we clarify that under our proposed <br/>

 <br/>
definition, EHI includes, but is not limited to, electronic protected health information (ePHI) as <br/>
defined in 45 CFR 160.103. In particular, unlike ePHI and health information, EHI is not limited <br/>
to information that is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, health care <br/>
clearinghouse, public health authority, employer, life insurer, school, or university. EHI may be <br/>
provided, directly from an individual, or from technology that the individual has elected to use, <br/>
to an actor covered by the information blocking provisions. We propose that EHI does not <br/>
include health information that is de-identified consistent with the requirements of 45 CFR <br/>
164.514(b). We generally request comment on this proposed definition as well as on whether the <br/>
exclusion of health information that is de-identified is consistent with the requirements of 45 <br/>
CFR 164.514(b). <br/>
 <br/>
To be clear, this definition provides for an expansive set of EHI, which could include <br/>
information on an individual’s health insurance eligibility and benefits, billing for health care <br/>
services, and payment information for services to be provided or already provided, which may <br/>
include price information.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<i>Price Information </i><br/>
The fragmented and complex nature of pricing within the health care system has <br/>
decreased the efficiency of the health care system and has had negative impacts on patients, <br/>
health care providers, health systems, plans, plan sponsors and other key health care <br/>
stakeholders. Patients and plan sponsors have trouble anticipating or planning for costs, are not <br/>
sure how they can lower their costs, are not able to compare costs, and have no practical way to <br/>
measure the quality of the care or coverage they receive relative to the price they pay. Pricing <br/>
information continues to grow in importance with the increase of high deductible health plans <br/>

 <br/>
and surprise billing, which have resulted in an increase in out-of-pocket health care spending. <br/>
Transparency in the price and cost of health care would help address the concerns outlined above <br/>
by empowering patients to make informed health care decisions. Further, the availability of price <br/>
information could help increase competition that is based on the quality and value of the services <br/>
patients receive. Consistent with its statutory authority, the Department is considering <br/>
subsequent rulemaking to expand access to price information for the public, prospective patients, <br/>
plan sponsors, and health care providers. <br/>
Increased consumer demand, aligned incentives, more accessible and digestible <br/>
information, and the evolution of price transparency tools are critical components to moving to a <br/>
health care system that pays for value. However, the complex and decentralized nature of how <br/>
price information is created, structured, formatted, and stored presents many challenges to <br/>
achieving price transparency. To this point, pricing within health care demands a market-based <br/>
approach whereby, for example, platforms are created that utilize raw data to provide consumers <br/>
with digestible price information through their preferred medium.  <br/>
ONC has a unique role in setting the stage for such future actions by establishing the <br/>
framework to prevent the blocking of price information. Given that price information impacts the <br/>
ability of patients to shop for and make decisions about their care, we seek comment on the <br/>
parameters and implications of including price information within the scope of EHI for purposes <br/>
of information blocking. In addition, the overall Department seeks comment on the technical, <br/>
operational, legal, cultural, environmental and other challenges to creating price transparency <br/>
within health care. <br/>

4. Interests Promoted by the Information Blocking Provision  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
a. Access, Exchange, and Use of EHI <br/>
 <br/>
The information blocking provision promotes the ability to <i>access, exchange, and use </i><br/>
EHI, consistent with the requirements of applicable law. We interpret the terms “access,” <br/>
“exchange,” and “use” broadly, consistent with their generally understood meaning in the health <br/>
IT industry and their function and context in the information blocking provision. <br/>
 <br/>
The concepts of access, exchange, and use are closely related: EHI cannot be used unless <br/>
it can be accessed, and this often requires that the EHI be exchanged among different individuals <br/>
or entities and through various technological means. Moreover, the technological and other <br/>
means necessary to facilitate appropriate access and exchange of EHI vary significantly <br/>
depending on the purpose for which the information will be used. For example, the technologies <br/>
and services that support a payer’s access to EHI to assess clinical value will likely differ from <br/>
those that support a patient’s access to EHI via a smartphone app. That is, to deter information <br/>
blocking in these and many other potential uses of EHI—and, by extension, the many and <br/>
diverse means of access and exchange that support such uses.   <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
This is consistent with the way these terms are employed in the information blocking <br/>
provision and in other relevant statutory provisions. For example, section 3022(a)(2) of the <br/>
PHSA contemplates a broad range of purposes for which EHI may be accessed, exchanged, and <br/>
used—from treatment, care delivery, and other permitted purposes, to exporting complete <br/>
information sets and transitioning between health IT systems, to supporting innovations and <br/>
advancements in health information access, exchange, and use. Separately, the Cures Act and the <br/>
HITECH Act contemplate many different purposes for and means of accessing, exchanging, and <br/>
using EHI, which include, but are not limited to, quality improvement, guiding medical decisions <br/>
at the time and place of care, reducing medical errors and health disparities, delivering patient-<br/>
centered care, and supporting public health and clinical research activities.<a href="ONCs.html#351">107</a> <br/>
 <br/>
In addition to these statutory provisions, we have considered how the terms access, <br/>
exchange, and use have been defined or used in existing regulations and other relevant health IT <br/>
industry contexts. While those definitions have specialized meanings and are not controlling <br/>
here, they are instructive insofar as they illustrate the breadth with which these terms have been <br/>
understood in other contexts. For example, the HIPAA Privacy Rule defines an individual’s right <br/>
of access to include the right to have a copy of all or part of their PHI transmitted directly to <br/>
them or any person or entity he or she designates, in any form and format (including <br/>
electronically) that the individual requests and that the covered entity holding the information <br/>
can readily produce (45 CFR § 164.524). In a different context, the HIPAA Security Rule defines <br/>
“access” as the ability or the means necessary to read, write, modify, or communicate <br/>
                                                 <br/>

data/information or otherwise use any system resource (45 CFR 164.304). The HIPAA Rules <br/>
also define the term “use,” which includes the sharing, employment, application, utilization, <br/>
examination, or analysis of individually identifiable health information within an entity that <br/>
maintains the information (45 CFR 160.103).  <br/>
As the examples and discussion above demonstrate, the concepts of access, exchange, <br/>
and use are used in a variety of contexts to refer to a broad spectrum of activities. We believe <br/>
that the types of access, exchange, and use described above would be promoted under the <br/>
information blocking provision, as would other types of access, exchange, or use not specifically <br/>
contemplated in these or other regulations. Further, we note that the information blocking <br/>
provision would also extend to innovations and advancements in health information access, <br/>
exchange, and use that may occur in the future (see section 3022(a)(2) of the PHSA).  <br/>
Consistent with the above, and to convey the full breadth of activities that may implicate <br/>
the information blocking provision, we propose definitions of access, exchange, and use in § <br/>
171.102. We emphasize the interrelated nature of the definitions. For example, the definition of <br/>
“use” includes the ability to read, write, modify, manipulate, or apply EHI to accomplish a <br/>
desired outcome or to achieve a desired purpose, while “access” is defined as the ability or <br/>
means necessary to make EHI available for <i>use</i>. As such, interference with “access” would <br/>
include, for example, an interference that prevented a health care provider from writing EHI to <br/>
its health IT or from modifying EHI stored in health IT, whether by the provider itself or by, or <br/>
via, a third-party app. We encourage comment on these definitions. In particular, commenters <br/>
may wish to consider whether these definitions are broad enough to cover all of the potential <br/>

purposes for which EHI may be needed and ways in which it could conceivably be used, now <br/>
and in the future.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
b. Interoperability Elements <br/>
 <br/>
In this proposed rule, we use the term “interoperability element” to refer to any means by <br/>
which EHI can be accessed, exchanged, or used. We clarify that the means of accessing, <br/>
exchanging, and using EHI are not limited to functional elements and technical information but <br/>
also encompass technologies, services, policies, and other conditions<a href="ONCs.html#353">108 </a>necessary to support the <br/>
many potential uses of EHI as described above. Because of the evolving nature of technology <br/>
and the diversity of privacy laws and regulations, institutional arrangements, and policies that <br/>
govern the sharing of EHI, we will not provide an exhaustive list of interoperability elements. <br/>
However, we believe that it is useful to define this term, both because of its importance for <br/>
analyzing the likelihood of interference under the information blocking provision, and because <br/>
some of the proposed exceptions to the provision contain conditions concerning the availability <br/>
and provision of interoperability elements. Therefore, we propose to define “interoperability <br/>
element” in § 171.102. As noted, our intent is to capture all of the potential means by which EHI <br/>
may be accessed, exchanged, or used for any relevant purposes; both now and as technology and <br/>
other conditions evolve. We seek comment on whether the proposed definition realizes that <br/>
intent and, if not, any changes we should consider.  <br/>

 <br/>
To meet the definition of information blocking, a practice must be <i>likely to interfere with, </i><br/>
<i>prevent, or materially discourage </i>access, exchange, or use of EHI. In this section and elsewhere <br/>
in this preamble, we discuss various types of hypothetical practices that <i>could</i> implicate the <br/>
provision. We do this to illustrate the scope of the information blocking provision and to explain <br/>
our interpretation of various statutory concepts. However, we stress that the types of practices <br/>
discussed in this preamble are illustrative, not exhaustive, and that many other types of practices <br/>
could also implicate the provision. Nor does the fact that we have not identified or discussed a <br/>
particular type of practice imply that it is less serious than those that are discussed in this <br/>
preamble. Indeed, because information blocking may take many forms, it is not possible—and <br/>
we do not attempt—to anticipate or catalog the many potential types of practices that may raise <br/>
information blocking concerns.  <br/>
We emphasize that any analysis of information blocking necessarily requires a careful <br/>
consideration of the individual facts and circumstances, including whether the practice was <br/>
required by law, whether the actor had the requisite statutory knowledge, and whether an <br/>
exception applies. When we state that a practice would implicate the provision or <i>could</i> violate <br/>
the provision, we are expressing a conclusion that the type of practice is one that would be likely <br/>
to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of EHI, and that <br/>
further analysis of these and other statutory elements would therefore be warranted to determine <br/>
whether a violation has occurred. We highlight this distinction because to <i>implicate</i> the <br/>
information blocking provision is not necessarily to <i>violate</i> it, and that each case will turn on its <br/>
own unique facts. For example, a practice that seemingly meets the statutory definition of <br/>

 <br/>
information blocking would not be information blocking if it was required by law, if one or more <br/>
elements of the definition were not met, or if was covered by one of the proposed exceptions.  <br/>
We propose in section VIII.D of this preamble to establish seven exceptions to the <br/>
information blocking provision for certain reasonable and necessary activities. If an actor can <br/>
establish that an exception applies to each practice for which a claim of information blocking has <br/>
been made, including that the actor satisfied all applicable conditions of the exception at all <br/>
relevant times, then the practice would not constitute information blocking.  <br/>
Based on early discussions with stakeholders during the development of this proposed <br/>
rule, we are aware that the generality with which the information blocking provision describes <br/>
practices that are likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or <br/>
use of EHI may leave some uncertainty as to the scope of the information blocking provision and <br/>
the types of practices that will implicate enforcement by ONC and/or OIG. To provide additional <br/>
clarity on this point, we elaborate our understanding of these important statutory concepts below.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
a. Prevention, Material Discouragement, and Other Interference <br/>
 <br/>
The information blocking provision and its enforcement subsection do not define the <br/>
terms “interfere with,” “prevent,” and “materially discourage,” and use these terms collectively <br/>
and without differentiation. Based on our interpretation of the information blocking provision <br/>
and the ordinary meanings of these terms in the context of EHI, we do not believe they are <br/>
mutually exclusive, but that prevention and material discouragement are best understood as types <br/>
of interference, and that use of these terms in the statute to define information blocking illustrates <br/>
the desire to reach all practices that an actor knows, or should know, are likely to prevent, <br/>
materially discourage, or otherwise interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI. Consistent <br/>

 <br/>
with this understanding, in this preamble to the proposed rule, we use the terms “interfere with” <br/>
and “interference” as inclusive of prevention, material discouragement, and other forms of <br/>
interference that implicate the information blocking provision.  <br/>
 <br/>
We believe that interference could take many forms. In addition to the prevention or <br/>
material discouragement of access, exchange, or use, we propose that interference could include <br/>
practices that increase the cost, complexity, or other burden associated with accessing, <br/>
exchanging, or using EHI. Additionally, interference could include practices that limit the utility, <br/>
efficacy, or value of EHI that is accessed, exchanged, or used, such as by diminishing the <br/>
integrity, quality, completeness, or timeliness of the data. We refer readers to section VIII.C.5.c <br/>
of this preamble below for a discussion of these and other potential practices that could interfere <br/>
with access, exchange, or use and thereby implicate the information blocking provision.  <br/>
Relatedly, to avoid potential ambiguity and clearly communicate the full range of <br/>
potential practices that could implicate the information blocking provision, we propose to codify <br/>
a definition of “interfere with” in § 171.102, consistent with our interpretation set forth above.   <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
b. Likelihood of Interference <br/>
 <br/>
The information blocking provision is preventative in nature. That is, the information <br/>
blocking provision proscribes practices that are <i>likely</i> to interfere with (including preventing or <br/>
materially discouraging) access, exchange, or use of EHI—whether or not such harm actually <br/>
materializes. By including both the likely and the actual effects of a practice, the information <br/>
blocking provision encourages individuals and entities to avoid engaging in practices that <br/>
undermine interoperability, and to proactively promote access, exchange, and use of EHI.  <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
We believe that a practice would satisfy the information blocking provision’s <br/>
“likelihood” requirement if, under the circumstances, there is a reasonably foreseeable risk that <br/>
the practice will interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. For example, where an actor <br/>
refuses to share EHI or to provide access to certain interoperability elements, it is reasonably <br/>
foreseeable that such actions will interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. As another <br/>
example, it is reasonably foreseeable that a health care provider may need to access information <br/>
recorded in a patient’s electronic record that could be relevant to the treatment of that patient. <br/>
For this reason, a policy or practice that limits timely access to such information in an <br/>
appropriate electronic format creates a reasonably foreseeable likelihood of interfering with the <br/>
use of the information for these treatment purposes. <br/>
 <br/>
Whether the risk of interference is reasonably foreseeable will depend on the particular <br/>
facts and circumstances attending the practice or practices at issue. Because of the number and <br/>
diversity of potential practices, and the fact that different practices will present varying risks of <br/>
interfering with access, exchange, or use of EHI, we do not attempt to anticipate all of the <br/>
potential ways in which the information blocking provision could be implicated. Nevertheless, to <br/>
assist with compliance, we clarify certain circumstances in which, based on our experience, a <br/>
practice will almost always be likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. We <br/>
caution that these situations are not exhaustive and that other circumstances may also give rise to <br/>
a very high likelihood of interference under the information blocking provision. In each case, <br/>
ONC will consider the totality of the circumstances in evaluating whether a practice is likely to <br/>
implicate the statute and to give rise to a violation.  <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Although the information blocking provision applies to all EHI, we believe that <br/>
information blocking concerns are especially pronounced when the conduct at issue has the <br/>
potential to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI that is created or maintained <br/>
during the practice of medicine or the delivery of health care services to patients. We refer to <br/>
such information in this section of the preamble collectively as “observational health <br/>
information.” Such information includes, but is not limited to, health information about a patient <br/>
that could be captured in a patient record within an EHR and other clinical information <br/>
management systems; as well as information maintained in administrative and other IT systems <br/>
when the information is clinically relevant, directly supports patient care, or facilitates the <br/>
delivery of health care services to consumers. We note that there is a special need for timely, <br/>
electronic access to this information and that, moreover, the clinical and operational utility of this <br/>
information is often highly dependent on multiple actors exercising varying forms and degrees of <br/>
control over the information itself or the technological, contractual, or other means by which it <br/>
can be accessed, exchanged, and used. Against these indications, practices that adversely impact <br/>
the access, exchange, or use of observational health information will almost always implicate the <br/>
information blocking provision.  <br/>
 <br/>
We note that observational health information may be technically structured or <br/>
unstructured (such as “free text”). Therefore, in general, clinicians’ notes would constitute <br/>
observational health information, at least insofar as the notes contain observations or conclusions <br/>
about a patient or the patient’s care. In contrast, we believe certain types of EHI are qualitatively <br/>
distinct from observational health information, such as EHI that is created through aggregation, <br/>
algorithms, and other techniques that transform observational health information into <br/>

 <br/>
fundamentally new data or insights that are not obvious from the observational information <br/>
alone. This could include, for example, population-level trends, predictive analytics, risk scores, <br/>
and EHI used for comparisons and benchmarking activities. Similarly, internally developed <br/>
quality measures and care protocols are generally distinct from observational health information. <br/>
In general, we believe that practices that pertain solely to the creation or use of these <br/>
transformative data and insights would not usually present the very high likelihood of <br/>
interference described above. However, we emphasize that, depending on the specific facts at <br/>
issue, practices related to electronic non-observational health information (a type of EHI), such <br/>
as price information, <b>could </b>still be subject to the information blocking provision. We seek <br/>
comment on this proposed approach and encourage commenters to identify potential practices <br/>
related to non-observational health information that could raise information blocking concerns. <br/>
Finally, we clarify that merely collecting, organizing, formatting, or processing <br/>
observational health information maintained in EHRs and other source systems does not change <br/>
the fundamental nature of that EHI or obligations under the information blocking provisions. <br/>
Likewise, the mere fact that EHI is stored in a proprietary format or has been combined with <br/>
confidential or proprietary information does not alter the actor’s obligations under the <br/>
information blocking provisions to facilitate access, exchange, and use of the EHI in response to <br/>
a request. For example, the information blocking provision would be implicated if an actor were <br/>
to assert proprietary rights in medical vocabularies or code sets in a way that was likely to <br/>
interfere with the access, exchange, or use of observational health information stored in such <br/>
formats. However, as noted in section VIII.D.6 of this preamble, under the exception for <br/>
licensing of interoperability elements on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, an actor could <br/>

 <br/>
ii. Purposes for Which Information May be Needed <br/>
 <br/>
We believe the information blocking provision will almost always be implicated when a <br/>
practice interferes with access, exchange, or use of EHI for certain purposes, including but not <br/>
limited to:  <br/>
•  Providing patients with access to their EHI and the ability to exchange and use it without <br/>
special effort (<i>see</i> section VII.B.4). <br/>
•  Ensuring that health care professionals, care givers, and other authorized persons have the <br/>
EHI they need, when and where they need it, to make treatment decisions and effectively <br/>
coordinate and manage patient care and can use the EHI they may receive from other <br/>
sources. <br/>
•  Ensuring that payers and other entities that purchase health care services can obtain the <br/>
information they need to effectively assess clinical value and promote transparency <br/>
concerning the quality and costs of health care services. <br/>
•  Ensuring that health care providers can access, exchange, and use EHI for quality <br/>
improvement and population health management activities. <br/>
•  Supporting access, exchange, and use of EHI for patient safety and public health purposes.  <br/>
 <br/>
The need to ensure that EHI is readily available and usable for these purposes is <br/>
paramount. Therefore, practices that increase the cost, difficulty, or other burden of accessing, <br/>
exchanging, or using EHI for these purposes would almost always implicate the information <br/>

blocking provision. Individuals and entities that develop health IT or have a role in making these <br/>
technologies and services available should consider the impact of their actions and take steps to <br/>
support interoperability and avoid impeding the availability or use of EHI.  <br/>
iii. Control Over Essential Interoperability Elements; Other Circumstances <br/>
of Reliance or Dependence  <br/>
 <br/>
An actor may have substantial control over one or more interoperability elements that <br/>
provide the only reasonable means of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI for a particular <br/>
purpose. In these circumstances, any practice by the actor that could impede the use of the <br/>
interoperability elements—or that could unnecessarily increase the cost or other burden of using <br/>
the elements—would almost always implicate the information blocking provision.  <br/>
The situation described above is most likely when customers or users are dependent on an <br/>
actor’s technology or services, which can occur for any number of reasons. For example, <br/>
technological dependence may arise from legal or commercial relations, such as a health care <br/>
provider’s reliance on its EHR developer to ensure that EHI managed on its behalf is accessible <br/>
and usable when it is needed. Relatedly, most EHI is currently stored in EHRs and other source <br/>
systems that use proprietary data models or formats. Knowledge of the data models, formats, or <br/>
other relevant technical information (e.g., proprietary APIs) is necessary to understand the data <br/>
and make efficient use of it in other applications and technologies. Because this information is <br/>
routinely treated as confidential or proprietary, the developer’s cooperation is required to enable <br/>
uses of the EHI that go beyond the capabilities provided by the developer’s technology. This <br/>
includes the capability to export complete information sets and to migrate data in the event that a <br/>
user decides to switch to a different technology.  <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Separate from these contractual and intellectual property issues, users may become <br/>
“locked in” to a particular technology, HIE, or HIN for financial or business reasons. For <br/>
example, many health care providers have invested significant resources to adopt EHR <br/>
technologies—including costs for deployment, customization, data migration, and training—and <br/>
have tightly integrated these technologies into their information management strategies, clinical <br/>
workflows, and business operations. As a result, they may be reluctant to switch to other <br/>
technologies due to the significant cost and disruption this would entail.  <br/>
 <br/>
Another important driver of technological dependence is the “network effects” of health <br/>
IT adoption, which are amplified by a reliance on technologies and approaches that are not <br/>
standardized and do not enable seamless interoperability. Consequently, health care providers <br/>
and other health IT users may gravitate towards and become reliant on the proprietary <br/>
technologies, HIEs, or HINs that have been adopted by other individuals and entities with whom <br/>
they have the greatest need to exchange EHI. These effects may be especially pronounced within <br/>
particular product or geographic areas. For example, a HIN that facilitates certain types of <br/>
exchange or transactions may be so widely adopted that it is a de facto industry standard. A <br/>
similar phenomenon may occur within a particular geographic area once a critical mass of <br/>
hospitals, physicians, or other providers adopt a particular EHR technology, HIE, or HIN.  <br/>
In these and other analogous circumstances of reliance or dependence, there is a <br/>
heightened risk that an actor’s conduct will interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. To <br/>

assist with compliance, we highlight the following common scenarios, based on our outreach to <br/>
stakeholders, in which actors exercise control over key interoperability elements.<a href="ONCs.html#363">109</a>  <br/>
•  Health IT developers of certified health IT that provide EHR systems or other technologies <br/>
used to capture EHI at the point of care are in a unique position to control subsequent access <br/>
to and use of that information.  <br/>
•  HINs and HIEs may be in a unique position to control the flow of information among <br/>
particular persons or for particular purposes, especially if the HIN or HIE has achieved <br/>
significant adoption in a particular geographic area or for a particular type of health <br/>
information use case.  <br/>
•  Similar control over EHI may be exercised by other entities, such as health IT developers of <br/>
certified health IT, that supply or control proprietary technologies, platforms, or services that <br/>
are widely adopted by a class of users or that are a “de facto standard” for certain types of <br/>
EHI exchanges or transactions. <br/>
•  Health care providers within health systems and other entities that provide health IT <br/>
platforms, infrastructure, or information sharing policies may have a degree of control over <br/>
interoperability or the movement of data within a geographic area that is functionally <br/>
equivalent to the control exercised by a dominant health IT developer, HIN, or HIE. <br/>
To avoid violating the information blocking provision, actors with control over <br/>
interoperability elements should be careful not to engage in practices that exclude persons from <br/>
the use of those elements or create artificial costs or other impediments to their use.  <br/>
                                                 <br/>

We encourage comment on these and other circumstances that may present an especially <br/>
high likelihood that a practice will interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI within the <br/>
meaning of the information blocking provision.  <br/>
c. Examples of Practices Likely to Interfere with Access, Exchange, or Use of <br/>
EHI <br/>
 <br/>
To further clarify the scope of the information blocking provision, below we describe <br/>
several types of practices that would be likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. <br/>
These examples clarify and expand on those set forth in section 3022(a)(2) of the PHSA.  <br/>
Because information blocking can take many forms, we emphasize that the categories of <br/>
practices described below are illustrative only and do not provide an exhaustive list or <br/>
comprehensive description of practices that may implicate the information blocking provision <br/>
and its penalties. We also reiterate that to implicate the provision is not necessarily to violate it, <br/>
and that each case will turn on its own unique facts. For instance, a practice that seemingly meets <br/>
the statutory definition of information blocking would not be information blocking if it was <br/>
required by law, if one or more elements of the definition were not met, or if it was covered by <br/>
one of the proposed exceptions for certain reasonable and necessary activities detailed in section <br/>
VIII.D of this preamble. For the purposes of the following discussion, we do not consider the <br/>
applicability of any exceptions proposed in section VIII.D of this preamble; we therefore <br/>
strongly encourage readers to review that section in conjunction with the discussion of practices <br/>
in this section below.  <br/>

 <br/>
The information blocking provision establishes penalties, including civil monetary <br/>
penalties, or requires appropriate disincentives, for practices that restrict access, exchange, or use <br/>
of EHI for permissible purposes. For example, section 3022(a)(2)(A) of the PHSA states that <br/>
information blocking may include practices that restrict authorized access, exchange, or use for <br/>
treatment and other permitted purposes under applicable law. Section 3022(a)(2)(C)(i) of the <br/>
PHSA states that information blocking may include implementing health IT in ways that are <br/>
likely to restrict the access, exchange, or use of EHI with respect to exporting complete <br/>
information sets or in transitioning between health IT systems. <br/>
 <br/>
One means by which actors may restrict access, exchange, or use of EHI is through <br/>
formal restrictions. These may be expressed in contract or license terms, EHI sharing policies, <br/>
organizational policies or procedures, or other instruments or documents that set forth <br/>
requirements related to EHI or health IT. Additionally, in the absence of an express contractual <br/>
restriction, an actor may achieve the same result by exercising intellectual property or other <br/>
rights in ways that restrict access, exchange, or use. As an illustration, the following non-<br/>
exhaustive examples illustrate types of formal restrictions that would likely implicate the <br/>
information blocking provision. As stated above, the examples throughout this section <br/>
VIII.C.5.c. are presented without consideration to whether a proposed exception applies, and <br/>
readers are encouraged to familiarize themselves with section VIII.D of this preamble. <br/>
•  A health system’s internal policies or procedures require staff to obtain an individual’s <br/>
written consent before sharing any of a patient’s EHI with unaffiliated providers for <br/>
treatment purposes even though obtaining an individual’s consent is not required by state or <br/>
federal law.  <br/>

•  An EHR developer’s software license agreement prohibits a customer from disclosing to its <br/>
IT contractors certain technical interoperability information without which the customer and <br/>
its IT contractors cannot efficiently export and convert EHI for use in other applications.  <br/>
•  A HIN’s participation agreement prohibits entities that receive EHI through the HIN from <br/>
transmitting that EHI to entities who are not participants of the HIN.  <br/>
•  An EHR developer sues to prevent a clinical data registry from providing interfaces to <br/>
physicians who use the developer’s EHR technology and wish to submit EHI to the registry. <br/>
The EHR developer claims that the registry is infringing the developer’s copyright in its <br/>
database because the interface incorporates data mapping that references the table headings <br/>
and rows of the EHR database in which the EHI is stored.  <br/>
 <br/>
Access, exchange, or use of EHI can also be restricted in less formal ways. The <br/>
information blocking provision would be implicated, for example, where an actor simply refuses <br/>
to exchange or to facilitate the access or use of EHI, either as a general practice or in isolated <br/>
instances. The refusal may be expressly stated, or it may be implied from the actor’s conduct, as <br/>
where the actor ignores requests to share EHI or provide interoperability elements; gives <br/>
implausible reasons for not doing so; or insists on terms or conditions that are so objectively <br/>
unreasonable that they amount to a refusal to provide access, exchange, or use of the EHI. Some <br/>
examples of informal restrictions include, but are not limited to: <br/>
•  A health IT developer of certified health IT refuses to license interoperability elements that <br/>
are reasonably necessary for the developer’s customers, their IT contractors, and other health <br/>
IT developers to develop and deploy software that will work with the certified health IT.   <br/>

•  A health system incorrectly claims that the HIPAA Rules or other legal requirements <br/>
preclude it from exchanging EHI with unaffiliated providers. <br/>
•  An EHR developer ostensibly allows third-party developers to deploy apps that are <br/>
interoperable with its EHR system. However, as a condition of doing so, the third-party <br/>
developers must provide their source code and grant the EHR developer the right to use it for <br/>
its own purposes—terms that almost no developer would willingly accept.  <br/>
•  A provider notifies its EHR developer of its intent to switch to another EHR system and <br/>
requests a complete export of its EHI. The developer will provide only the EHI in a PDF <br/>
format, even though it already can and does produce the data in a commercially reasonable <br/>
structured format.  <br/>
We emphasize that restrictions on access, exchange, or use that are required by law <br/>
would not implicate the information blocking provision. Moreover, we recognize that some <br/>
restrictions, while not required by law, may be reasonable and necessary for the privacy and <br/>
security of individuals’ EHI; such practices may qualify for protection under the exceptions <br/>
proposed in section VIII.D.2 and 3 of this preamble.  <br/>

 <br/>
ii. Limiting or Restricting the Interoperability of Health IT <br/>
The information blocking provision includes practices that restrict the access, exchange, <br/>
or use of EHI in various ways (<i>see</i> section 3022(a)(2) of the PHSA). These practices could <br/>
include, for example, disabling or restricting the use of a capability that enables users to share <br/>
EHI with users of other systems or to provide access to EHI to certain types of persons or for <br/>
certain purposes that are legally permissible. In addition, the information blocking provision <br/>
would be implicated where an actor configures or otherwise implements technology in ways that <br/>

 <br/>
limit the types of data elements that can be exported or used from the technology. Other practices <br/>
that would be suspect include configuring capabilities in a way that removes important context, <br/>
structure, or meaning from the EHI, or that makes the data less accurate, complete, or usable for <br/>
important purposes for which it may be needed. Likewise, implementing capabilities in ways that <br/>
create unnecessary delays or response times, or that otherwise limit the timeliness of EHI <br/>
accessed or exchanged, would interfere with the access, exchange, and use of that information <br/>
and would therefore implicate the information blocking provision. We note that any conclusions <br/>
regarding such interference would be based on fact-finding specific to each case and would need <br/>
to consider the applicability of an exception.   <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that the information blocking provision would be implicated if an actor were <br/>
to deploy technological measures that limit or restrict the ability to reverse engineer the <br/>
functional aspects of technology in order to develop means for extracting and using EHI <br/>
maintained in the technology. This may include, for example, employing technological <br/>
protection measures that, if circumvented, would trigger liability under the Digital Millennium <br/>
Copyright Act (<i>see</i> 17 U.S.C. 1201) or other laws.  <br/>
The following hypothetical situations illustrate some (though not all) of the types of <br/>
practices described above and which would implicate the information blocking provision.  <br/>
•  A health system implements locally-hosted EHR technology certified to proposed § <br/>
170.315(g)(10) (the health system acts as an API Data Provider as defined by § 170.102). As <br/>
required by proposed § 170.404(b)(2), the technology developer provides the health system <br/>
with the capability to automatically publish its production endpoints (i.e., the internet servers <br/>
that an app must “call” and interact with in order to request and exchange patient data). The <br/>

 <br/>
health system chooses not to enable this capability, however, and provides the production <br/>
endpoint information only to apps it specifically approves. This prevents other applications—<br/>
and patients that use them—from accessing data that should be made readily accessible via <br/>
standardized APIs. <br/>
•  A hospital directs its EHR developer to configure its technology so that users cannot easily <br/>
send electronic patient referrals and associated EHI to unaffiliated providers, even when the <br/>
user knows the Direct address and/or identity (i.e., National Provider Identifier) of the <br/>
unaffiliated provider.  <br/>
•  An EHR developer that prevents (such as by way of imposing exorbitant fees unrelated to the <br/>
developer’s costs, or by some technological means) a third-party clinical decision support <br/>
(CDS) app from writing EHI to the records maintained by the EHR developer on behalf of a <br/>
health care provider (despite the provider authorizing the third-party app developer’s use of <br/>
EHI) because the EHR developer: (1) offers a competing CDS software to the third-party <br/>
app; and (2) includes functionality (e.g., APIs) in its health IT that would provide the third <br/>
party with the technical capability to modify those records as desired by the health care <br/>
provider. <br/>
•  Although an EHR developer’s patient portal offers the capability for patients to directly <br/>
transmit or request for direct transmission of their EHI to a third party, the developer’s <br/>
customers (e.g., health care providers) choose not to enable this capability. <br/>
•  A health care provider has the capability to provide same-day access to EHI in a form and <br/>
format requested by a patient or a patient’s health care provider, but takes several days to <br/>
respond. <br/>

iii. Impeding Innovations and Advancements in Access, Exchange, or Use  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
or Health IT-enabled Care Delivery <br/>
 <br/>
The information blocking provision encompasses practices that create impediments to <br/>
innovations and advancements to the access, exchange, and use of EHI, including care delivery <br/>
enabled by health IT (section 3022(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the PHSA). Importantly, the information <br/>
blocking provision would be implicated and penalties may apply if an actor were to engage in <br/>
exclusionary, discriminatory, or other practices that impede the development, dissemination, or <br/>
use of interoperable technologies and services that enhance access, exchange, or use of EHI.  <br/>
 <br/>
Most acutely, the information blocking provision would be implicated if an actor were to <br/>
refuse to license or allow the disclosure of interoperability elements to persons who require those <br/>
elements to develop and provide interoperable technologies or services—including those that <br/>
might complement or compete with the actor’s own technology or services. The same would be <br/>
true if the actor were to allow access to interoperability elements but were to restrict their use for <br/>
these purposes. The following examples, which are not exhaustive, illustrate practices that would <br/>
likely implicate the information blocking provision by interfering with access, exchange, or use <br/>
of EHI: <br/>
•  A health IT developer of certified health IT refuses to license an API’s interoperability <br/>
elements, to grant the rights necessary to commercially distribute applications that use the <br/>
API’s interoperability elements, or to provide the related services necessary to enable the use <br/>
of such applications in production environments.  <br/>

•  An EHR developer of certified health IT requires third-party applications to be “vetted” for <br/>
security before use but does not promptly conduct the vetting or conducts the vetting in a <br/>
discriminatory or exclusionary manner.  <br/>
•  A health IT developer of certified health IT refuses to license interoperability elements that <br/>
other software applications require to efficiently access, exchange, and use EHI maintained <br/>
in the developer’s technology.  <br/>
 <br/>
Rather than restricting interoperability elements, an actor may insist on terms or <br/>
conditions that are burdensome and discourage their use. These practices would implicate the <br/>
information blocking provision for the reasons described above. Consider the following non-<br/>
exhaustive examples:  <br/>
•  An EHR developer of certified health IT maintains an “app store” through which other <br/>
developers can have “apps” listed that run natively on the EHR developer’s platform. <br/>
However, if an app “competes” with the EHR developer’s apps or apps it plans to develop, <br/>
the developer <i>requires</i> that the app developer grant the developer the right to use the app’s <br/>
source code.   <br/>
•  A health care provider engages a systems integrator to develop an interface engine. However, <br/>
the provider’s license agreement with its EHR developer prohibits it from disclosing <br/>
technical documentation that the systems integrator needs to perform the work. The EHR <br/>
developer states that it will only permit the systems integrator to access the documentation if <br/>
all of its employees sign a broad non-compete agreement that would effectively bar them <br/>
from working for any other health IT companies.  <br/>

The information blocking provision would be implicated also if an actor were to <br/>
discourage efforts to develop or use interoperable technologies or services by exercising its <br/>
influence over customers, users, or other persons, as in the following non-exhaustive examples: <br/>
•  An EHR developer of certified health IT maintains an “app store” through which other <br/>
developers can have “apps” listed that run natively on the EHR developer’s platform. The <br/>
EHR developer charges app developers a substantial fee for this service unless an app <br/>
developer agrees not to deploy the app in any other EHR developers’ app stores. <br/>
•  A hospital is working with several health IT developers to develop an application that will <br/>
enable ambulatory providers who use different EHR systems to access and update patient <br/>
data in the hospital’s EHR system from within their ambulatory EHR workflows. The <br/>
inpatient EHR developer, being a health IT developer of certified health IT, pressures the <br/>
hospital to abandon this project, stating that if it does not it will no longer receive the latest <br/>
updates and features for its inpatient EHR system.   <br/>
•  A health IT developer of certified health IT discourages customers from procuring data <br/>
integration capabilities from a third-party developer, claiming that it will be providing such <br/>
capabilities free of charge in the next release of its product. In reality, the capabilities it is <br/>
developing are more limited in scope and are still 12-18 months from being production-<br/>
ready.  <br/>
•  A health system insists that local physicians adopt its EHR platform, which provides limited <br/>
connectivity with competing hospitals and facilities. The health system threatens to revoke <br/>
admitting privileges for physicians that do not comply. <br/>

Similar concerns would arise were an actor to engage in discriminatory practices—such <br/>
as imposing unnecessary and burdensome administrative, technical, contractual, or other <br/>
requirements on certain persons or classes of persons—that interfere with access and exchange <br/>
or EHI by frustrating or discouraging efforts to enable interoperability. The following non-<br/>
exhaustive examples illustrate some ways this could occur:  <br/>
•  An HIN charges additional fees, requires more stringent testing or certification requirements, <br/>
or imposes additional terms for participants that are competitors, are potential competitors, or <br/>
may use EHI obtained via the HIN in a way that facilitates competition with the HIN.  <br/>
•  A health care provider imposes one set of fees and terms to establish interfaces or data <br/>
sharing arrangements with several registries and exchanges, but offers another more costly or <br/>
significantly onerous set of terms to establish substantially similar interfaces and <br/>
arrangements with an HIE or HIN that is used primarily by health plans that purchase health <br/>
care services from the provider at negotiated reduced rates.  <br/>
•  A health IT developer of certified health IT charges customers fees, throttles speeds, or limits <br/>
the number of records they can export when exchanging EHI with a regional HIE that <br/>
supports exchange among users of competing health IT products, but does not impose like <br/>
fees or limitations when its customers exchange EHI with enterprise HIEs that primarily <br/>
serve users of the developer’s own technology.  <br/>
•  As a condition of disclosing interoperability elements to third-party developers, an EHR <br/>
developer requires third-party developers to enter into business associate agreements with all <br/>
of the EHR developer’s covered entity customers, even if the work being done is not for the <br/>
benefit of the covered entities.  <br/>

 <br/>
•  A health IT developer of certified health IT takes significantly longer to provide or update <br/>
interfaces that facilitate the exchange of EHI with users of competing technologies or <br/>
services.  <br/>
 <br/>
We clarify that not all instances of differential treatment would necessarily constitute a <br/>
discriminatory practice that implicates the information blocking provision. For example, <br/>
different fee structures or other terms may reflect genuine differences in the cost, quality, or <br/>
value of the EHI and the effort required to provide access, exchange, or use. We also note that, in <br/>
certain circumstances, it may be reasonable and necessary for an actor to restrict or impose <br/>
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms or conditions on the use of interoperability elements, <br/>
even though such practices could implicate the information blocking provision. For this reason, <br/>
we propose in section VIII.D.6 of this preamble to establish a narrow exception that would apply <br/>
to these types of practices.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
iv. Rent-seeking and Other Opportunistic Pricing Practices <br/>
Certain practices that artificially increase the cost and expense associated with accessing, <br/>
exchanging, and using EHI will implicate the information blocking provision. Such practices are <br/>
plainly contrary to the information blocking provision and the concerns that motivated its <br/>
enactment.   <br/>
An actor may seek to extract profits or capture revenue streams that would be <br/>
unobtainable without control of a technology or other interoperability elements that are necessary <br/>
to enable or facilitate access, exchange, or use of EHI. As discussed in section VIII.C.5.b.iii of <br/>
this proposed rule, most EHI is currently stored in EHRs and other source systems that use <br/>
proprietary data models or formats; this puts EHR developers (and other actors that control data <br/>

models or standards) in a unique position to block access to (including the export and portability <br/>
of) EHI for use in competing systems or applications, or to charge rents for access to the basic <br/>
technical information needed to accomplish the access, exchange, or use of EHI for these <br/>
purposes. These information blocking concerns may be compounded to the extent that EHR <br/>
developers do not disclose, in advance, the fees they will charge for interfaces, data export, data <br/>
portability, and other interoperability-related services (<i>see</i> 80 FR 62719; 80 FR 16880–81). We <br/>
note that these concerns are not limited to EHR developers. Other actors who exercise substantial <br/>
control over EHI or essential interoperability elements may engage in analogous behaviors that <br/>
would implicate the information blocking provision.  <br/>
To illustrate, we provide the following non-exhaustive examples, which reflect some of <br/>
the more common types of rent-seeking and opportunistic behaviors of which we are aware and <br/>
that are likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI:  <br/>
•  An EHR developer of certified health IT charges customers a fee to provide interfaces, <br/>
connections, data export, data conversion or migration, or other interoperability services, <br/>
where the amount of the fee exceeds the actual costs that the developer reasonably incurred <br/>
to provide the services to the particular customer(s).  <br/>
•  An EHR developer of certified health IT charges a fee to perform an export using the EHI <br/>
export capability proposed in § 170.315(b)(10) for the purposes of switching health IT <br/>
systems or to provide patients access to EHI.  <br/>
•  An EHR developer of certified health IT charges more to export or use EHI in certain <br/>
situations or for certain purposes, such as when a customer is transitioning to a competing <br/>
technology or attempting to export data for use with a HIE, third-party application, or other <br/>

 <br/>
technology or service that competes with the revenue opportunities associated with the EHR <br/>
developer’s own suite of products and services. <br/>
•  An EHR developer of certified health IT interposes itself between a customer and a third-<br/>
party developer, insisting that the developer pay a licensing fee, royalty, or other payment in <br/>
exchange for permission to access the EHR system or related documentation, where the fee is <br/>
not reasonably necessary to cover any additional costs the EHR developer incurs from the <br/>
third-party developer’s activities.  <br/>
•  An analytics company provides services to the customers of an EHR developer of certified <br/>
health IT, including de-identifying customer EHI and combining it with other data to identify <br/>
areas for quality improvement. The EHR developer insists on a revenue sharing arrangement <br/>
whereby it would receive a percentage of the revenue generated from these activities in <br/>
return for facilitating access to its customers’ EHI, which turns out to be disadvantageous to <br/>
customers. The revenue the EHR developer would receive exceeds its reasonable costs of <br/>
facilitating the access to EHI. <br/>
The information blocking provision would clearly be implicated by these and other <br/>
practices by which an actor profits from its unreasonable control over EHI or interoperability <br/>
elements without adding any efficiency to the health care system or serving any other <br/>
procompetitive purpose. But the reach of the information blocking provision is not limited to <br/>
these types of practices. We interpret the definition of information blocking to encompass <i>any </i><br/>
fee that materially discourages or otherwise imposes a material impediment to access, exchange, <br/>
or use of EHI. We use the term “fee” in the broadest possible sense to refer to any present or <br/>
future obligation to pay money or provide any other thing of value and propose to include this <br/>

definition in § 171.102. We believe this scope may be broader than necessary to address genuine <br/>
information blocking concerns and could unnecessarily diminish investment and innovation in <br/>
interoperable technologies and services. Therefore, as discussed in section VIII.D.4 of this <br/>
preamble, we propose to create an exception that, subject to certain conditions, would permit the <br/>
recovery of costs that are reasonably incurred to provide access, exchange, and use of EHI. We <br/>
refer readers to that section for additional details regarding this proposal.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
v. Non-standard Implementation Practices  <br/>
 <br/>
Section 3022(a)(2)(B) of the PHSA states that information blocking may include <br/>
implementing health IT in non-standard ways that substantially increase the complexity or <br/>
burden of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI. In general, this type of interference is likely to <br/>
occur when, despite the availability of generally accepted technical, policy, or other approaches <br/>
that are suitable for achieving a particular implementation objective, an actor does not implement <br/>
the standard, does not implement updates to the standard, or implements the standard in a way <br/>
that materially deviates from its formal specifications. These practices lead to unnecessary <br/>
complexity and burden, such as the additional cost and effort required to implement and maintain <br/>
“point-to-point” connections, custom-built interfaces, and one-off trust agreements.  <br/>
 <br/>
While each case will necessarily depend on its individual facts, and while we recognize <br/>
that the development and adoption of standards across the health IT industry is an ongoing <br/>
process, we propose that the information blocking provision would be implicated in at least two <br/>
distinct sets of circumstances. First, information blocking may arise where an actor chooses not <br/>
to adopt, or to materially deviate from, relevant standards, implementation specifications, and <br/>
certification criteria adopted by the Secretary under section 3004 of the PHSA. Second, even <br/>

 <br/>
where no federally adopted or identified standard exists, if a particular implementation approach <br/>
has been broadly adopted in a relevant industry segment, deviations from that approach would be <br/>
suspect unless strictly necessary to achieve substantial efficiencies.  <br/>
To further illustrate these types of practices that would implicate the information <br/>
blocking provision, we provide the following non-exhaustive examples of conduct that would be <br/>
likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI:  <br/>
•  An EHR developer of certified health IT implements the C-CDA for receiving transitions of <br/>
care summaries but only sends transitions of care summaries in a proprietary or outmoded <br/>
format.  <br/>
•  A health IT developer of certified health IT adheres to the “required” portions of a widely <br/>
adopted industry standard but chooses to implement proprietary approaches for “optional” <br/>
parts of the standard when other interoperable means are readily available.  <br/>
 <br/>
Even where no standards exist for a particular purpose, actors should not design or <br/>
implement health IT in non-standard ways that unnecessarily increase the costs, complexity, and <br/>
other burden of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI. For example, an EHR developer of <br/>
certified health IT designs its database tables in a way that is unreasonably difficult to “map” to a <br/>
non-proprietary format, which is a necessary prerequisite to converting the EHI to a format that <br/>
can be used in other software applications. When a customer requests the capability to export <br/>
EHI to a clinical data registry, the EHR developer quotes substantial costs resulting from the <br/>
need to write custom code to enable this functionality. Based on these facts, the fees do not <br/>
reflect costs that are reasonably incurred to provide the service and are instead the result of the <br/>
developer’s impractical design choices. We are aware that some actors attribute certain non-<br/>

 <br/>
standard implementations on legacy systems that the actor did not themselves design but which <br/>
have to be integrated into the actor’s health IT. Such instances will be considered on a case by <br/>
case basis.  <br/>
Again, we reiterate that information blocking can take many forms and that the practices <br/>
(and categories of practices) described above do not provide an exhaustive list or comprehensive <br/>
description of practices that may implicate the information blocking provision.  <br/>
6. Applicability of Exceptions <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
a. Reasonable and Necessary Activities  <br/>
 <br/>
As discussed above, section 3022(a)(3) authorizes the Secretary to identify, through <br/>
notice and comment rulemaking, reasonable and necessary <i>activities</i> that do not constitute <br/>
information blocking for purposes of the definition set forth in section 3022(a)(1). Separately, <br/>
the Cures Act identifies at section 3022(a)(1) <i>practices</i> that contravene the definition of <br/>
information blocking. Following this Cures Act terminology, conduct that implicates the <br/>
information blocking provision and that does not fall within one of the exceptions described in <br/>
section VIII.D of this preamble, or does not meet all conditions for an exception, would be <br/>
considered a “practice.” Conduct that falls within an exception and meets all the applicable <br/>
conditions for that exception would be considered an “activity.” The challenge with this <br/>
distinction is that when examining conduct that is the subject of an information blocking claim—<br/>
an actor’s actions that likely interfered with access, exchange, or use of EHI—it can be illusory <br/>
to distinguish, on its face, conduct that is a <i>practice</i> and conduct that is an <i>activity</i>. Indeed, <br/>
conduct that implicates the information blocking provision but falls within an exception could <br/>

 <br/>
nonetheless be considered information blocking in the event that the actor has not satisfied the <br/>
conditions applicable to that exception.  <br/>
 <br/>
While we acknowledge the terminology used in the Cures Act, we propose to use the <br/>
term “practice” throughout this proposed rule when we describe conduct that is likely to interfere <br/>
with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of electronic health information, <br/>
regardless of whether that conduct meets the conditions for an exception to the information <br/>
blocking provision. Consistent with this approach, when identifying reasonable and necessary <br/>
activities in §§ 171.200 through 171.206, we describe <i>practices</i> that, if all the applicable <br/>
conditions are met, are reasonable and necessary and not information blocking. We have taken <br/>
this approach, in part, because we believe that to adopt the terminology of activity to describe <br/>
conduct that may or may not be information blocking would confuse the reader and obfuscate <br/>
our intent in certain circumstances. As an illustration, a health care provider may implement an <br/>
organizational security policy that limits access, exchange, or use of certain information to <br/>
certain users (e.g. role-based access). Prior to determining whether the implementation of the <br/>
security policy is reasonable and necessary under the circumstances, such conduct would be <br/>
considered a “practice” that implicates the information blocking provision. However, it may later <br/>
be determined that such conduct is reasonable and necessary and would then be considered an <br/>
“activity.” Due to these types of scenarios, we contend that the better approach is to use one <br/>
term—practice—throughout the proposed rule and clarify when describing the conduct at issue <br/>
whether it is a practice that is information blocking, a practice that implicates the information <br/>
blocking provision, or a practice that is reasonable and necessary and not information blocking. <br/>

 <br/>
The proposed exceptions would apply to health care providers, health IT developers of <br/>
certified health IT, HIEs, and HINs who engage in certain practices covered by an exception, <br/>
provided that all applicable conditions of the exception are satisfied at all relevant times and for <br/>
each practice for which the exception is sought. The exceptions are generally applicable to all <br/>
actors. However, in some instances we propose conditions within an exception that apply to a <br/>
particular type of actor. <br/>
c. Establishing that Activities and Practices Meet the Conditions of an Exception<br/>
 <br/>
We propose that, in the event of an investigation of an information blocking complaint, <br/>
an actor must demonstrate that an exception is applicable and that the actor met all relevant <br/>
conditions of the exception at all relevant times and for each practice for which the exception is <br/>
sought. We consider this allocation of proof to be a substantive condition of the proposed <br/>
exceptions. As a practical matter, we propose that actors are in the best position to demonstrate <br/>
compliance with the conditions of the proposed exceptions and to produce the detailed evidence <br/>
necessary to demonstrate that compliance. We request comment about the types of <br/>
documentation and/or standardized methods that an actor may use to demonstrate compliance <br/>
with the exception conditions. <br/>
<i>D. Proposed Exceptions to the Information Blocking Provision </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose to establish seven exceptions to the information blocking provision. The <br/>
exceptions would apply to certain activities that may technically meet the definition of <br/>
information blocking but that are reasonable and necessary to further the underlying public <br/>
policies of the information blocking provision.  <br/>

 <br/>
The seven proposed exceptions are based on three related policy considerations. First, <br/>
each exception is limited to certain activities that clearly advance the aims of the information <br/>
blocking provision. These reasonable and necessary activities include providing appropriate <br/>
protections to prevent harm to patients and others; promoting the privacy and security of EHI; <br/>
promoting competition and innovation in health IT and its use to provide health care services to <br/>
consumers, and to develop more efficient means of health care delivery; and allowing system <br/>
downtime in order to implement upgrades, repairs, and other changes to health IT. Second, each <br/>
exception addresses a significant risk that regulated actors will not engage in these beneficial <br/>
activities because of uncertainty concerning the breadth or applicability of the information <br/>
blocking provision. Finally, each exception is subject to strict conditions to ensure that it is <br/>
limited to activities that are reasonable and necessary. <br/>
 <br/>
The first three exceptions, set forth in VIII.D.1-D.3, extend to certain activities that are <br/>
reasonable and necessary to prevent harm to patients and others; promote the privacy of EHI; <br/>
and promote the security of EHI, subject to strict conditions to prevent the exceptions from being <br/>
misused. We believe that without these exceptions, actors may be reluctant to engage in the types <br/>
of reasonable and necessary activities described below, and that this could erode trust in the <br/>

conditions are met. Second, we propose to permit an actor to decline to provide access, <br/>
exchange, or use of EHI in a manner that is infeasible, subject to a duty to provide a reasonable <br/>
alternative. And, third, we propose an exception that would permit an actor to license <br/>
interoperability elements on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. These exceptions would <br/>
be subject to strict conditions to ensure that they do not extend protection to practices that raise <br/>
information blocking concerns.  <br/>
The last exception, set forth in VIII.D.7, recognizes that it may be reasonable and <br/>
necessary for actors to make health IT temporarily unavailable for the benefit of the overall <br/>
performance of health IT. This exception would permit an actor to make the operation of health <br/>
IT unavailable in order to implement upgrades, repairs, and other changes. <br/>
As context for the exceptions proposed below in VIII.D.4-D.6, we note that addressing <br/>
information blocking is critical for promoting competition and innovation in health IT and for the <br/>
delivery of health care services to consumers. Indeed, the information blocking provision itself <br/>
expressly addresses practices that impede innovations and advancements in health information <br/>
access, exchange, and use, including care delivery enabled by health IT (section <br/>
3022(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the PHSA). As discussed in section VIII.C.5.b.iii of this preamble, health IT <br/>

exploit their control over interoperability elements to create barriers to entry for competing <br/>

in developing the exceptions described in VIII.D.4-D.6 of this preamble. We note that the <br/>
language in the Cures Act regarding information blocking is substantively and substantially <br/>
different from the language and goals in the antitrust laws enforced by the FTC. We view the <br/>
Cures Act as authorizing ONC and OIG to regulate conduct that may be considered permissible <br/>
under the antitrust laws. On this basis, this proposed rule requires that actors who control <br/>
interoperability elements cooperate with individuals and entities that require those elements for <br/>
the purpose of developing, disseminating, and enabling technologies and services that can <br/>
interoperate with the actor’s technology.  <br/>
We emphasize that ONC is taking this approach because we view patients as having an <br/>
overwhelming interest in EHI about themselves, and particularly observational health <br/>
information (see the discussion in section VIII.C.4.b of this preamble). As such, access to EHI, <br/>
and the EHI itself, should not be traded or sold by those actors who are custodians of EHI or who <br/>
control its access, exchange, or use. We emphasize that such actors should not be able to charge <br/>
fees for providing electronic access, exchange, or use of patients’ EHI. We propose that actors <br/>
should be required to share EHI unless they are prohibited from doing so under an existing law <br/>
or are covered by one of the exceptions detailed in this preamble. In addition, any remedy sought <br/>
or action taken by HHS under the information blocking provision would be independent from the <br/>
antitrust laws and would not prevent FTC or DOJ from taking action with regard to the same <br/>
actor or conduct.  <br/>
 <br/>
We request comment on the following seven proposed exceptions, including whether <br/>
they will achieve our stated policy goals.             <br/>

 <br/>
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking provision for practices <br/>
that are reasonable and necessary to prevent harm to a patient or another person, provided certain <br/>
conditions are met. The exception and corresponding conditions are set forth in the proposed <br/>
regulation text in § 171.201. <br/>
 <br/>
This proposed exception would acknowledge the public interest in protecting patients and <br/>
other persons against unreasonable risks of harm that, in certain narrowly defined circumstances <br/>
described below, justify practices that are likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI <br/>
and that would implicate the information blocking provision in the absence of an exception.  <br/>
The exception would be subject to strict conditions, which we believe are necessary to <br/>
prevent patient safety from being used as a pretext for information blocking or as a post hoc <br/>
rationalization for practices that are not reasonable and necessary to address material risks of <br/>
harm to a patient or another person. <br/>
 <br/>
We have adopted the terminology of “patient” to denote the context in which the threat of <br/>
harm arises. That is, this proposed exception has been designed to recognize certain practices <br/>
taken for the benefit of recipients of health care—those individuals whose EHI is at issue—and <br/>
other persons whose information may be recorded in that EHI or who may be at risk of harm <br/>
because of the access, use, or exchange of EHI. The use of the term “patient” does not require, <br/>
other than in the context of the risk of harm determined by a licensed<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=0bf30072cd447089063e3f884e42f705&term_occur=1&term_src=Title:45:Chapter:A:Subchapter:C:Part:164:Subpart:E:164.524"> health care </a>professional <br/>
(<i>see</i> § 171.201(a)(3)), that an actor seeking to benefit from this exception needs to have a <br/>
clinician-patient relationship with the individual (or individuals) at risk of harm. Indeed, a health <br/>

Similarly, an HIE or HIN that exchanges or facilitates the exchange of EHI would be able to <br/>
benefit from this exception in connection with the activities carried out by the HIE or HIN for or <br/>
at the direction of a health care provider. <br/>
<i>Patient harm risks that would be cognizable under this exception. </i><br/>
 <br/>
Consistent with the definition of information blocking, we have identified certain risks to <br/>
patient harm that arise in the context of access, exchange, or use of EHI. To qualify for this <br/>
proposed exception, an actor’s practice must respond to a risk that is cognizable under this <br/>
exception.  <br/>
 <br/>
<i>Risk of</i> <i>corrupt or inaccurate data being recorded or incorporated in a patient’s </i><br/>
<i>electronic health record </i><br/>
 <br/>
The exception may apply to practices that prevent harm arising from corrupted or <br/>
inaccurate EHI being recorded or incorporated in a patient’s electronic health record. Users of <br/>
health IT systems strive to maintain accurate electronic health records by carefully inputting EHI <br/>
and verifying existing EHI. Occasionally a clinician or other user of health IT is presented with <br/>
EHI that, due to a failure of the technology, is either entirely incorrect or contains inaccurate <br/>
information. At other times, EHI could become corrupted. In these cases, the sharing or <br/>
integration of such EHI could lead to inaccuracies in the patient’s electronic health record that <br/>
then run the risk of being propagated further. We note, however, that known inaccuracies in <br/>
some data within a record may not be sufficient justification to withhold the entire record if the <br/>
remainder of the patient’s EHI could be effectively shared without also presenting the known <br/>
incorrect or corrupted information as if it were trustworthy. Also, we would expect that once <br/>

information is known to be inaccurate or corrupted, a health care provider holding that record <br/>
would, for example, take action to cure the inaccuracy or corruption. We understand that in the <br/>
ordinary course of practice, and consistent with professional and legal standards for clinical <br/>
record keeping, health care providers take appropriate action to remediate known problems with <br/>
EHI and restore a record as a whole to be safely usable, and therefore safely sharable.   <br/>
This recognized risk is limited to corruption and inaccuracies caused by performance and <br/>
technical issues affecting health IT. For example, this exception may be relevant if certified <br/>
health IT were to incorrectly present an old and superseded version of a medication list, or when <br/>
only partial copies of laboratory tests are being linked to a patient when the patient’s record is <br/>
exchanged. However, this recognized risk does not extend to purported accuracy issues arising <br/>
from the incompleteness of a patient’s electronic health record generally. Electronic health <br/>
records, like the paper charts they replaced, are inevitably imperfect records. Many patients see <br/>
multiple health care providers and so it is unlikely that any single health care provider’s record <br/>
will provide a complete picture of a patient’s health. Some patients intentionally keep certain <br/>
information secret even from their health care providers, and others fail to share potentially <br/>
critical information with their health care providers because they forget to, or simply do not <br/>
understand its clinical significance.  <br/>
While the access, exchange, or use of EHI in these situations could give rise to the risk of <br/>
harm if the EHI was relied on without qualification, such reliance does not accord with our <br/>
understanding of clinical practice, as the risk of incompleteness resulting from patients having <br/>
multiple providers, or from errors of omission by patients and their care providers, is not unique <br/>
to electronic health records or their interoperable exchange. Therefore, the risk that the EHI a <br/>

given health care provider holds for a given patient may not be a perfectly complete record of <br/>
that patient’s health or care will not be recognized as being sufficient to support an actor <br/>
qualifying for this exception in the face of a claim of information blocking.  <br/>
We also acknowledge that certain federal and state laws, such as 42 CFR part 2 and state <br/>
medical record laws, require an actor to obtain an individual’s written consent before sharing <br/>
health information. However, we propose that an actor would not be able to benefit from this <br/>
exception on the basis of a perceived risk arising from exchanging or providing access to EHI <br/>
when the EHI exchanged or made accessible does not include certain information due to a <br/>
patient’s decision not to consent to its disclosure. For example, this exception would not <br/>
recognize an actor’s conduct in not providing access, exchange, or use of a patient’s electronic <br/>
health record on the basis that the patient’s failure to consent to the disclosure of substance abuse <br/>
treatment information made the patient’s record incomplete and thus inaccurate. <br/>
<i>Risk of misidentifying a patient or patient’s electronic health information </i><br/>
 <br/>
The exception may apply to practices that are designed to promote data quality and <br/>
integrity and support health IT applications properly identifying and matching patient records or <br/>
EHI. Accurately identifying patients and correctly attributing their EHI to them is a complex task <br/>
and involves layers of safeguards, including verification of a patient’s identity, proper <br/>
registration in health IT systems, physical identification such as wristbands, and usability and <br/>
implementation decisions such as ensuring the display of a patient’s name and date of birth on <br/>
every screen of the patient’s electronic chart. When a clinician or other health IT user may know <br/>
or reasonably suspect that specific EHI in a patient’s record is or may be misattributed, either <br/>
within a local record or as received through EHI exchange, it would be reasonable for them to <br/>

 <br/>
avoid sharing or incorporating the EHI that they know would, or reasonably suspect could, <br/>
propagate errors in the patient’s records and thus pose the attendant risks to the patient. As <br/>
discussed below, an actor’s response to this risk would need to be no broader than necessary to <br/>
mitigate the risk of harm arising from the potentially misidentified record or misattributed data. <br/>
A health IT developer of certified health IT could not, for example, refuse to provide a batch <br/>
export on the basis that the exported records may contain a misidentified record. Similarly, a <br/>
health care provider that identified that a particular piece of information had been misattributed <br/>
to a patient would not be excused from exchanging or providing access to all other EHI about the <br/>
patient that had not been misattributed. <br/>
<i>Determination by a licensed health care professional that the disclosure of EHI is </i><br/>

 <br/>

circumstances where a licensed<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=0bf30072cd447089063e3f884e42f705&term_occur=1&term_src=Title:45:Chapter:A:Subchapter:C:Part:164:Subpart:E:164.524"> health care </a>professional has determined, in the exercise of <br/>

We request comment on whether the categories of harm described above capture the full <br/>
range of safety risks that might arise directly from accessing, exchanging, or using EHI. We also <br/>
request comment on whether we should consider other types of patient safety risks related to data <br/>
quality and integrity concerns, or that may have a less proximate connection to EHI but that <br/>
could provide a reasonable and necessary basis for an actor to restrict or otherwise impede <br/>
access, exchange, or use of EHI in appropriate circumstances. We ask that commenters provide <br/>
detailed rationale for any suggested revisions to these categories, including additional conditions <br/>
that may be necessary to ensure that the exception is tailored and does not extend protection to <br/>
practices that are not reasonable and necessary to promote patient safety and that could present <br/>

To qualify for this exception, an actor must have had a reasonable belief that the practice <br/>

person. As discussed above, the type of risk must also be cognizable under this exception.  <br/>

than necessary for the type of patient safety risks at issue. In these circumstances, we propose <br/>
that an actor’s policy would need to satisfy the following requirements.  <br/>
 <br/>
First, we propose that the policy must be in writing. Second, it must have been developed <br/>

expertise or insight relevant to the risk of harm that the policy addresses. This condition would <br/>
not be met if, for example, a hospital imposed top-down information sharing policies or <br/>
workflows established by the hospital’s EHR developer and approved by hospital administrators <br/>
without meaningful input from the medical staff, IT department, and front-line clinicians who <br/>
would implement, and thus be affected by, the policy and are in the best position to gauge how <br/>
effective it will be at mitigating patient safety risks.  <br/>
 <br/>
Third, we propose that the policy must have been implemented in a consistent and non-<br/>
discriminatory manner. As part of this condition, the actor must have taken reasonable steps to <br/>
educate its directors, officers, employees, contractors, and authorized personnel on how to apply <br/>
the policy and to provide appropriate oversight to ensure that the policy is not applied in an <br/>
arbitrary, discriminatory, or otherwise inappropriate manner. This condition would not be met if, <br/>
for example, a policy or practice were based on factors that lacked a direct and substantial <br/>
correlation with the particular risk of harm at issue.  <br/>
Last, we propose that the policy must have been be no broader than necessary for the <br/>
specific risk or type of risk at issue. . For example, as evidence that the policy is no broader than <br/>
necessary, the policy would need to identify the relevant risks and follow an approach to <br/>
mitigating those risks that is based on current patient safety evidence and best practices, <br/>
supplemented by input from clinical, technical, and other staff or others who are in the best <br/>

position to make judgments about the policy’s effectiveness, as discussed above. Further <br/>
evidence that the policy was no broader than necessary would be whether the actor  considered <br/>
alternative approaches and reasonably concluded that, under the circumstances, those approaches <br/>
were either inadequate to address the identified risks of harm or would not have reduced the <br/>
likelihood of interference with access, exchange, or use of EHI. For example, a tailored response <br/>
to the existence of corrupted data would necessarily permit all uncorrupted EHI to continue to be <br/>
accessed, used, and exchanged. This condition would not be met, for example, if an actor’s <br/>
policy imposed a blanket ban on the sharing of EHI with users of different technologies or with <br/>
health care providers who are not part of a particular health system, HIE, or HIN.  <br/>
<i>Qualifying individualized finding </i><br/>
We recognize that some health care providers (such as small practices) may not have <br/>
comprehensive and formal policies governing all aspects of EHI and patient safety. Additionally, <br/>
even if an organizational policy exists, it may not anticipate all of the potential risks of harm that <br/>
could arise in real-world clinical or production environments of health IT. In these <br/>
circumstances, in lieu of demonstrating that a practice conformed to the actor’s policies and that <br/>
the policies met the conditions described above, the actor could justify the practice or practices <br/>
directly by making a finding in each case, based on the particularized facts and circumstances, <br/>
that the practice is necessary and no broader than necessary to mitigate the risk of harm. To do <br/>
so, we propose that the actor would need to show that the practices were approved on a case-by-<br/>
case basis by an individual with direct knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances and <br/>
who had relevant clinical, technical, or other appropriate expertise. Such an individual would <br/>
need to reasonably conclude, on the basis of those particularized facts and circumstances and <br/>

his/her expertise and best professional judgment, that the practice was necessary, and no broader <br/>
than necessary, to mitigate the risk of harm to a patient or other persons.  <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that a licensed health care professional’s independent and individualized <br/>
judgment about the safety of the actor’s patients or other persons would be entitled to substantial <br/>
deference under this proposed exception. So long as the clinician actually considered all of the <br/>
relevant facts and determined that, under the particular circumstances, the practice was necessary <br/>
to protect the safety of the clinician’s patient or other person, we would not second-guess the <br/>
clinician’s judgment. To provide further clarity on this point, we provide the following <br/>
illustration.  <br/>
 <br/>
A clinician suspects that a patient is at risk of domestic abuse. The patient has recently <br/>
visited the clinic for a pregnancy test, and tells the clinician that the potential father is not her <br/>
current partner. The test returns a positive result. The clinician notes that in the patient’s <br/>
electronic health record, her partner has been given access to view her test results. The clinician, <br/>
considering all factors for this particular situation and particular patient, and aware of the clinic’s <br/>
policy towards the restriction of electronic health information sharing, concludes that releasing <br/>
this result electronically could place the patient at risk of harm. The clinician thus chooses not to <br/>
release the test result electronically and plans to deliver the result to the patient in a safe manner. <br/>
The exception would apply in this case because the clinician reasonably believes, based on the <br/>
relationship with this particular patient and the clinician’s best clinical judgment, that the <br/>
restriction is necessary to prevent harm to the patient.  <br/>
 <br/>
We seek public comment on whether this proposed exception is appropriate and <br/>
adequately balances the interest of promoting access, exchange, and use of EHI with legitimate <br/>

concerns about the risk of harm to patients and others. In addition to any other relevant issues, <br/>
we specifically request feedback on whether the exception is broad enough to prevent harm to <br/>
patients and others and, if not, what additional risks we should address should we finalize this <br/>
proposal; and whether there are additional safeguards the Secretary should adopt in order to <br/>
prevent practices that attempt to undermine the policy goal of the exception. We also seek <br/>
comment on whether there are customary practices (e.g., standards of care) that advance patient <br/>
safety concerns but which actors do not, as a matter of practice, record in documented policies, <br/>
and which should be taken into account when assessing the reasonableness of a practice under <br/>
this exception. <br/>
2. Promoting the Privacy of EHI <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking provision for practices <br/>
that are reasonable and necessary to protect the privacy of an individual’s EHI, provided certain <br/>
conditions are met. The exception and corresponding conditions are set forth in the proposed <br/>
regulation text in § 171.202. We note that any practice engaged in to protect the privacy of an <br/>
individual’s EHI must be consistent with applicable laws related to health information privacy, <br/>
including the HIPAA Privacy Rule as applicable, as well as with other applicable laws and <br/>
regulations, such as the HITECH Act, 42 CFR part 2, and state laws. This exception to the <br/>
information blocking provision does not alter an actor’s obligation to comply with these and <br/>
other applicable laws. <br/>
 <br/>
We believe this exception is necessary to support basic trust and confidence in health IT <br/>
infrastructure. Without this exception, there would be a significant risk that actors would share <br/>
EHI in inappropriate circumstances, such as when an individual has taken affirmative steps to <br/>

 <br/>
request that the EHI not be shared, or when an actor has been unable to obtain reasonable <br/>
assurances as to an individual’s identity. <br/>
In contrast to the other exceptions defined in this proposed rule, this proposed exception <br/>
has been structured with discrete “sub-exceptions.” An actor’s practice must qualify for a sub-<br/>
exception in order to be covered by this exception. The sub-exceptions have, to a large extent, <br/>
been crafted to closely mirror privacy-protective practices that are recognized under state and <br/>
federal privacy laws. In this way, the privacy sub-exceptions to the information blocking <br/>
provision would recognize as reasonable and necessary practices that are engaged in by actors <br/>
consistent with privacy laws, provided that certain conditions are met. We have proposed four <br/>
sub-exceptions that address the following privacy protective practices: (1) not providing access, <br/>
exchange, or use of EHI when a state or federal law requires that a condition be satisfied before <br/>
an actor provides access, exchange, or use of EHI, and the condition is not satisfied (proposed in <br/>
§ 171.202(b)); (2) not providing access, exchange, or use of EHI when the actor is a health IT <br/>
developer of certified health IT that is not covered by the HIPAA Privacy Rule in respect to a <br/>
practice (proposed in § 171.202(c)); (3) a covered entity, or a business associate on behalf of a <br/>
covered entity, denying an individual’s request for access to their electronic PHI in the <br/>
circumstances provided in 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1), (2), or (3) (proposed at § 171.202(d)); and (4) <br/>
not providing access, exchange, or use of EHI pursuant to an individual’s request, in certain <br/>
situations (proposed in § 171.202(e)). The rationale for each sub-exception is described in detail <br/>
below. <br/>
An actor would need to satisfy at least one sub-exception in order that a purportedly <br/>
privacy-protective practice that interferes with access, exchange, or use of EHI not be subject to <br/>

the information blocking provision. Each sub-exception has conditions that must be met in order <br/>
that an actor’s practice qualifies for protection under the sub-exception.  <br/>
<i>Specific terminology used for the purposes of this proposed exception </i><br/>
 <br/>
We note that this proposed exception and our discussion below uses certain terms that are <br/>
defined by the HIPAA Rules<a href="ONCs.html#397">114 </a>but that, for purposes of this exception, may have a broader <br/>
meaning in the context of the information blocking provision and its implementing regulations as <br/>
set forth in this Proposed Rule. In general, the terms “access,” “exchange,” and “use” have the <br/>
meaning explained in section VIII.C.4.a of this preamble. However, in some instances we refer <br/>
to “use” in the context of a disclosure or use of ePHI under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, in which <br/>
case we have explicitly stated that the term “use” has the meaning defined in 45 CFR 160.103. <br/>
Similarly, we refer in a few cases to an individual’s right of access under 45 CFR 164.524, in <br/>
which case the term “access” should be understood in that HIPAA Privacy Rule context. For <br/>
purposes of section 3022 of the PHSA, however, the term “access” includes, but is broader than, <br/>
an individual’s access to their PHI as provided for by the HIPAA Privacy Rule (see section <br/>
VIII.C.4.a of this preamble).<b> </b><br/>
 <br/>
Finally, the term “individual” is defined by the HIPAA Rules at 45 CFR 160.103. <br/>
Separately, under the information blocking enforcement provision, the term “individual” is used <br/>
to refer to actors that are health IT developers of certified health IT, HINs, or HIEs, (<i>see</i> section <br/>
3022(b)(2)(A) of the PHSA). For purposes of this exception (and only this exception), we use <br/>
neither of these definitions. Instead, the term “individual” encompasses any or all of the <br/>
following: (1) an individual defined by 45 CFR 160.103; (2) a person who is the subject of EHI <br/>

individual or person described in (1) or (2), including as a personal representative, in accordance <br/>
with 45 CFR 164.502(g); or (4) a legal representative authorized to make health care decisions <br/>
on behalf of a person or an executor or administrator who can act on behalf of the deceased’s <br/>
estate under state or other law.  <br/>
We clarify that (2) varies from (1) because there could be individuals who could be the <br/>
subject of EHI that is being accessed, exchanged, or used under (2), but who would not be the <br/>
subject of PHI under (1). The purpose of (2) is to include EHI that would be accessed, exchanged <br/>
or used by entities that are not subject to HIPAA (e.g., non-covered entities and non-business <br/>
associates). These entities could include, for example, health IT developers or data analytics <br/>
companies that have access to EHI, but are not business associates. <br/>
We also clarify that (3) encompasses a person with <i>legal </i>authority to act on behalf of the <br/>
individual, which includes a person who is a personal representative as defined under the HIPAA <br/>
Privacy Rule. We included the component of <i>legal</i> authority to act in (3) because the HIPAA <br/>
Privacy Rule gives rights to parents or legal guardians in certain circumstances where they are <br/>
not the “personal representative” for their child(ren). For instance, a non-custodial parent who <br/>
has requested a minor child’s medical records under a court-ordered divorce decree may have <br/>
legal authority to act on behalf of the child even if he or she is not the child’s “personal <br/>
representative.” Further, in limited circumstances and if permitted under state law, a family <br/>

emergency situations even if that family member may not be the “legal representative” or <br/>
“personal representative” of the patient. <br/>
We have adopted this specialized usage to ensure that this privacy exception extends <br/>
protection to information about, and respects the privacy preferences of, <i>all </i>individuals, not only <br/>
those individuals whose EHI is protected as ePHI by HIPAA covered entities and business <br/>
associates.  <br/>
<i>Interaction between information blocking, the exception for promoting the privacy of EHI, and </i><br/>
<i>the HIPAA Privacy Rule </i><br/>
Having consulted extensively with the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR), who enforce <br/>
the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules, we have developed the information <br/>
blocking provision to advance our shared goals of preventing information blocking for nefarious <br/>
or self-interested purposes while maintaining and upholding existing privacy rights and <br/>
protections for individuals. The proposed exception for promoting the privacy of EHI (also <br/>
referred to as “the privacy exception”) operates in a manner consistent with the framework of the <br/>
HIPAA Privacy Rule. We designed these exceptions to ensure that individual privacy rights are <br/>
not diminished as a consequence of the information blocking provision, and to ensure that the <br/>
information blocking provision does not require the use or disclosure of EHI in a way that would <br/>
not be permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Our intent is that the information blocking <br/>
provision does not conflict with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Indeed, the sub-exception proposed in <br/>
§ 171.202(d) reflects a policy judgment that an actor’s denial of access to an individual <br/>
consistent with the limited conditions for such denials that are described in the HIPAA Privacy <br/>
Rule at 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1), (2), and (3) is reasonable under the circumstances. We believe <br/>

 <br/>
this resolves any potential conflict between limitations on an individual’s right of access under <br/>
the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the information blocking provision.  <br/>
We note that the information blocking provision may operate to require that actors <br/>
provide access, exchange, or use of EHI in situations that HIPAA does not. This is because the <br/>
HIPAA Privacy Rule permits, but does not require, covered entities to use and disclose ePHI in <br/>
most circumstances. The information blocking provision, on the other hand, requires that an <br/>
actor provide access to, exchange, or use of EHI unless they are prohibited from doing so under <br/>
an existing law or are covered by one of the exceptions detailed in this preamble. To illustrate, <br/>
the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits health care providers to exchange ePHI for treatment purposes, <br/>
but does not require them to do so. Under the information blocking provision, unless an <br/>
exception to information blocking applies, or the interference is required by law, a primary care <br/>
provider would be required to exchange ePHI with a specialist who requests it to treat an <br/>
individual who was a common patient of the provider and the specialist, even if the primary care <br/>
provider offered patient care services in competition with the specialist’s practice, or would <br/>
usually refer its patients to another specialist due to an existing business relationship. <br/>
<i>Promoting patient privacy rights </i><br/>
As discussed above, the information blocking provision would not require that actors <br/>
provide access, exchange, or use of EHI in a manner that is not permitted under the HIPAA <br/>
Privacy Rule or other privacy laws. As such, the privacy-protective controls existing under <br/>
HIPAA would not be weakened by the information blocking provision. Moreover, we have <br/>
structured the privacy exception to ensure that actors can engage in reasonable and necessary <br/>
practices that advance the privacy interests of individuals. <br/>

 <br/>
For example, we believe that, unless required by law, actors should not be compelled to <br/>
share EHI against patients’ wishes or without adequate safeguards out of a concern that <br/>
restricting the access, exchange, or use of the EHI would constitute information blocking. This <br/>
could seriously undermine patients’ trust and confidence in the privacy of their EHI and diminish <br/>
the willingness of patients, providers, and other entities to provide or maintain health information <br/>
electronically in the first place. In addition, such outcomes would undermine and not advance the <br/>
goals of the information blocking provision and be inconsistent with the broader policy goal of <br/>
the Cures Act to facilitate trusted exchange of EHI. Trusted exchange requires not only that EHI <br/>
be shared in accordance with applicable law, but also that it be shared in a manner that <br/>
effectuates individuals’ expressed privacy preferences. We note and discuss below that an <br/>
individual’s expressed privacy preferences will not be controlling in all cases. An actor will not <br/>
be able to rely on an individual’s expressed privacy preference in circumstances where the <br/>
access, exchange, or use is required by law. <br/>
For these reasons, we propose that the proposed sub-exception in § 171.202(e) would <br/>
generally permit an actor to give effect to individuals’ expressed privacy preferences, including <br/>
their desire not to permit access, exchange, or use of their EHI. For example, provided that <br/>
corresponding conditions have been met, a health care provider could honor a patient’s request <br/>
not to share their EHI in circumstances in which the HIPAA Privacy Rule would permit (though <br/>
not require) the provider to disclose the information, such as for treatment purposes. At the same <br/>
time, however, we believe that the privacy exception must be tailored to ensure that protection of <br/>
an individual’s privacy is not used as a pretext for information blocking. Accordingly, we <br/>

 <br/>
propose that this exception, which is discussed more fully below, would be subject to strict <br/>
conditions.  <br/>
<i>Privacy Practices Required by Law </i><br/>
Because the information blocking provision excludes from the definition of information <br/>
blocking practices that are required by law (section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA), privacy-protective <br/>
practices that are required by law do not implicate the information blocking provision and do not <br/>
require coverage from an exception. For example, the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that a <br/>
covered entity must agree to the request of an individual to restrict disclosure of protected health <br/>
information (PHI) about the individual to a health plan if the disclosure is for the purpose of <br/>
carrying out payment or health care operations and not otherwise required by law and the PHI <br/>
pertains solely to a health care item or service for which the individual, or person other than the <br/>
health plan on behalf of the individual, has paid the covered entity in full.<a href="ONCs.html#402">115 </a>If an individual <br/>
made such a request and met all requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the actor would be <br/>
<i>required by law </i>not to exchange the individual’s EHI to a health plan. In this situation, the <br/>
actor’s interference with access, exchange, or use would not be information blocking and as <br/>
such, the actor would not need to benefit from this exception.  <br/>
Practices that are “required by law” can be distinguished from other practices that an <br/>
actor engages in pursuant to a privacy law, but which are not “required by law.” Such privacy <br/>
laws are typically framed in a way that conditions the making of a “disclosure” on the satisfying <br/>

that a covered entity <i>may</i> use or disclose PHI in certain circumstances where the individual <br/>
concerned has authorized the disclosure.<a href="ONCs.html#403">116 </a>The effect of this requirement is that the covered <br/>
entity should not use or disclose the PHI in the absence of an individual’s authorization. <br/>
However, because the requirement does not prohibit the actor from exchanging the EHI in all <br/>
circumstances, the actor would be at risk of engaging in a practice that was information blocking <br/>
unless an exception applied. For this reason, we have included a sub-exception, addressed in § <br/>
171.202(b) and discussed below, that provides that an actor will not be engaging in information <br/>
blocking if a state or federal privacy law imposes a precondition to the provision of access, <br/>
exchange, or use, and that precondition has not been satisfied. <br/>
<i>Sub-exception to proposed privacy exception: Precondition not satisfied  </i><br/>
 <br/>
State and federal privacy laws that permit the disclosure of PHI often impose conditions <br/>
that must be satisfied prior to a disclosure being made. We propose to establish a sub-exception <br/>
to the information blocking provision that recognizes that an actor will not be engaging in <br/>
information blocking if an actor does not provide access, exchange, or use of EHI because a <br/>
necessary precondition required by law has not been satisfied. This exception will apply to all <br/>
instances where an actor’s ability to provide access, exchange, or use is “controlled” by a legal <br/>
obligation to satisfy a condition, or multiple conditions, prior to providing that access, exchange, <br/>
or use. To be covered by this exception, the actor must comply with conditions, which are <br/>
discussed below. <br/>
The nature of the preconditions that an actor must satisfy in order to provide access, <br/>
exchange, or use of EHI will depend on the privacy laws that regulate the actor. An actor that is <br/>

regulated by a restrictive state privacy law may need to satisfy more conditions than an actor <br/>
regulated by a less restrictive state privacy law, before providing access, exchange, or use. <br/>
Similarly, certain state privacy laws may impose standards for meeting preconditions that are <br/>
more rigorous than the laws in force elsewhere.  <br/>
To illustrate how we propose this sub-exception would operate, we provide the following <br/>
examples. We note that this list of examples is not exhaustive and that preconditions required by <br/>
law that control access, exchange, or use of EHI that are not listed below would still qualify <br/>
under this proposed sub-exception so long as all conditions are met. <br/>
•  Certain federal and state laws require that a person provide consent before his or her EHI <br/>
can be accessed, exchanged, or used for specific purposes. Although the HIPAA Privacy <br/>
Rule does not have consent requirements for an individual (as that term is defined in the <br/>
HIPAA Privacy Rule) when a covered entity or business associate is using or disclosing <br/>
ePHI for treatment, payment or health care operations, some state laws and federal laws and <br/>
regulations do require that a person’s consent be obtained by the disclosing party/entity <br/>
before disclosing certain health information. For example, for some sensitive health <br/>
conditions such as HIV/AIDS, mental health, or genetic testing, state laws may impose a <br/>
higher standard for disclosure of such information (i.e., require consent) than is required <br/>
under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Additionally, under 42 CFR part 2, federally-assisted “Part <br/>
2 programs” generally are required to obtain a person’s consent to disclose or re-disclose <br/>
patient-identifying information related to the person’s substance use disorder, such as <br/>
treatment for addiction. The exception would operate to clarify an actor’s compliance <br/>
obligations in these situations. It would not be considered information blocking to refuse to <br/>

subject to conditions discussed herein. <br/>
•  If an actor is required by law to obtain an individual’s HIPAA authorization before <br/>
providing access, exchange, or use of the individual’s EHI, then the individual’s refusal to <br/>
provide an authorization would justify the actor’s refusal to provide access, exchange, or use <br/>
of EHI. The actor’s refusal would, subject to conditions discussed herein, be protected under <br/>
this exception. <br/>
•  The HIPAA Privacy Rule, and many state privacy laws, authorize the disclosure of PHI in <br/>
certain circumstances only once the identity and authority of the person requesting the <br/>
information has been verified. We acknowledge that it is reasonable and necessary that <br/>
actors take appropriate steps, consistent with federal and state laws, to ensure that EHI is not <br/>
disclosed to the wrong person or to a person who is not authorized to receive it. Where an <br/>
actor cannot verify the identity or authority of a person requesting access to EHI, and such <br/>
verification is required by law before the actor can provide access, exchange, or use of the <br/>
EHI, the actor’s refusal to provide access, exchange, or use will, subject to the conditions <br/>
discussed herein, be reasonable and necessary and will not be information blocking. <br/>
•  Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, a health care provider may share information with another <br/>
health care provider for a quality improvement project if it has verified that the requesting <br/>
entity has a relationship with the person whose information is being requested. Where the <br/>
actor could not establish if the relationship existed, it would not be information blocking for <br/>
the actor to refuse to provide access, exchange, or use, subject to the conditions discussed <br/>
herein. <br/>

We seek comments generally on this proposed sub-exception. More specifically, we seek <br/>
comment on how this proposed sub-exception would be exercised by actors in the context of <br/>
state laws. We are aware that actors that operate across state lines or in multiple jurisdictions <br/>
sometimes adopt organization-wide privacy practices that conform with the most restrictive <br/>
privacy laws regulating their business. In order to ensure that the information blocking provision <br/>
does not diminish the privacy rights of individuals being serviced by such actors, we are <br/>
considering the inclusion of an accommodation in this sub-exception that would recognize an <br/>
actor’s observance of a legal precondition that the actor is required by law to satisfy in at least <br/>
one state in which it operates. We believe this approach would be consistent with practices <br/>
already in place for multi-state health care systems. For example, some states require specific <br/>
consent requirements before exchanging sensitive health information such as a patient’s mental <br/>
health condition. As a result, the health care system will utilize one consent form for multi-<br/>
jurisdiction purposes in order to meet various federal and state law requirements. However, in <br/>
the event that we did adopt such an accommodation, we would also need to carefully consider <br/>
how to ensure that before the use of the most stringent restriction is applied in all jurisdictions, <br/>
the actor has provided all privacy protections afforded by that law across its entire business. This <br/>
type of approach would ensure that an actor cannot take advantage of a more-restrictive privacy <br/>
law for the benefit of this exception while not also fulfilling the privacy-protective obligations of <br/>
the law being relied on. We seek comment on whether there is a need for ONC to adopt such an <br/>
accommodation for actors operating in multiple states, and encourage commenters to identify <br/>
any additional conditions that should attach to the provision of such an accommodation. We also <br/>

request comment on our proposed approach to dealing with varying state privacy laws <br/>
throughout this proposed sub-exception. <br/>
We also recognize that under the patchwork of state privacy laws, some states have <br/>
enacted laws that more comprehensively identify the circumstance in which an individual or <br/>
entity can and cannot provide access, exchange, or use of EHI. We are considering to what <br/>
extent health care providers that are not regulated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and would rely <br/>
instead on state laws for this sub-exception, would be able to benefit from this sub-exception <br/>
when engaging in practices that interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI for the purpose of <br/>
promoting patient privacy. We seek comment on any challenges that may be encountered by <br/>
health care providers that are not regulated as covered entities under the HIPAA Privacy Rule <br/>
when seeking to take advantage of this proposed sub-exception. We also seek comment on <br/>
whether there exists a class of health care provider that is not regulated by <i>any</i> federal or state <br/>
privacy law that prescribes preconditions that must be satisfied in connection with the disclosure <br/>
of EHI, and whether any such class of health care provider would benefit from a sub-exception <br/>
similar to that proposed in § 171.202(c) for health IT developers of certified health IT. <br/>
<i>Conditions to be met to qualify for the sub-exception </i><br/>
In most circumstances, an actor would be in a position to influence whether a <br/>
precondition is satisfied. For example, an actor could deprive a person of the opportunity to take <br/>
some step that is a prerequisite for the exchange of their EHI, could assume the existence of a <br/>
fact prejudicial to the granting of access without seeking to discover the truth or otherwise of the <br/>
fact, or could make a determination that a precondition was not satisfied without properly <br/>
informing itself of all relevant information. As such, we propose that this exception would be <br/>

subject to conditions that ensure that the protection of an individual’s privacy is not used as a <br/>
pretext for information blocking.  <br/>
We propose that an actor can qualify, in part, for this sub-exception by implementing and <br/>
conforming to organizational policies and procedures that identify the criteria to be used by the <br/>
actor and, as applicable, the steps that the actor will take, in order to satisfy the precondition. <br/>
Most actors are covered entities or business associates for the purposes of the HIPAA Privacy <br/>
Rule, and are already required to have policies and procedures and training programs in place <br/>
that address how PHI and ePHI is used (as that term is defined in 45 CFR 160.103, as amended) <br/>
and disclosed. As such, we expect that the overwhelming majority of actors will already be in a <br/>
position to meet this condition, or would be able to meet this condition with modest additional <br/>
effort. However, we acknowledge that some actors may not, for whatever reason, have privacy <br/>
policies and practices in place, or may have implemented privacy policies and practices that do <br/>
not sufficiently address the criteria to be used, and steps to be taken, to satisfy a precondition <br/>
relied on by the actor. As such, we propose to provide an alternative basis on which to qualify, in <br/>
part, for this sub-exception. We propose to permit actors to instead document, on a case-by-case <br/>
basis, the criteria used by the actor to determine when the precondition will be satisfied, any <br/>
criteria that were not met, and the reason why the criteria were not met. These alternative <br/>
conditions, which are discussed in detail below, ensure that this sub-exception does not protect <br/>
practices that are post hoc rationalizations used to justify improper practices, whilst also ensuring <br/>
that actors do not face any pressure to disclose EHI in the situation where they do not have <br/>
privacy policies and practices in place, or where their privacy policies and practices do not <br/>
respond to the requirements of this condition.  <br/>

 <br/>
Separately, we propose that if the precondition that an actor purports to have been <br/>
satisfied relies on the provision of a consent or authorization from an individual, it is a condition <br/>
of this sub-exception that the actor must have done all things reasonably necessary within its <br/>
control to provide the individual with a meaningful opportunity to provide that consent or <br/>
authorization. <br/>
We reiterate, again, that the information blocking provision does not require the provision <br/>
of access, exchange, or use of EHI in a manner that would not be permitted under the HIPAA <br/>
Privacy Rule.  <br/>
<i>Organizational policies and procedures </i><br/>
If an actor seeks to qualify for this sub-exception, in part, by implementing and conforming <br/>
to organizational policies and procedures, such policies and procedures must be in writing, and <br/>
specify the criteria to be used by the actor, and, if applicable, the steps that the actor will take, in <br/>
order to satisfy the precondition relied on by the actor not to provide access, exchange, or use of <br/>
EHI. It would not be sufficient for an actor to simply identify the existence of the precondition in <br/>
their organizational policies and procedures. <br/>
We acknowledge that certain preconditions may be outside the direct control of the actor. <br/>
For example, the requirement that an actor receive a valid authorization before releasing EHI in <br/>
certain circumstances would be a precondition to be satisfied by the individual, and the actor <br/>
may have little ability to influence the nature of the authorization that it receives. For <br/>
preconditions of this nature, the actor’s policies and procedures would only need to identify the <br/>
criteria that the actor will apply and the steps that the actor will take to facilitate the satisfaction <br/>
of the precondition, such as identifying the requirements for a valid authorization and the follow <br/>

 <br/>
up steps (if any) to be taken in response to receipt of an authorization that does not meet those <br/>
requirements. In contrast, where the satisfaction of a precondition relies solely on an actor, such <br/>
as the “minimum necessary” determination made by HIPAA covered entities (or their business <br/>
associates) when exchanging EHI that is ePHI, the actor’s policies and procedures would need to <br/>
particularize the steps that the actor will take in order to ensure that it satisfies the precondition. <br/>
Where the precondition falls somewhere in between and relies on actions taken by both the actor <br/>
and an individual, the actor’s policies and procedures would need to address how the actor would <br/>
do the things necessary within its control, which would include the steps it should take to <br/>
facilitate all actions needed to be taken by an individual.  <br/>
Take, for example, the situation where an actor needed to determine whether the subject <br/>
individual had a relationship with a requesting entity as a precondition to exchanging EHI. The <br/>
actor’s policies and practices should, at minimum, identify the criteria to be applied, being the <br/>
evidence that the actor would need in order to satisfy itself of the existence of a relationship, <br/>
such as receipt of a Medicare or other insurance number, or other indicia of a relationship such as <br/>
the establishment of a doctor-patient relationship.   <br/>
An actor would only be eligible to benefit from this sub-exception if it has followed its <br/>
processes and policies. Continuing the above example, an actor that chose not to provide access <br/>
to EHI on the basis that insufficient evidence had been provided to establish the existence of the <br/>
relationship, would need to show that its decision was based on the applicable criteria specified <br/>
in the actor’s policy and practices. <br/>
Using a different example, and as discussed above, the HIPAA Privacy Rule generally <br/>
requires covered entities (and their business associates) to take reasonable steps to limit the use <br/>

or disclosure of, and requests for, PHI to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended <br/>
purpose.<a href="ONCs.html#411">117 </a>Satisfying the “minimum necessary” requirement is a precondition to be met under <br/>
the HIPAA Privacy Rule before an actor exchanges ePHI for many purposes. The determination <br/>
of what constitutes the “minimum necessary” is a fact based judgment made by an actor. To <br/>
allow covered entities the flexibility to address their unique circumstances, the HIPAA Privacy <br/>
Rule requires covered entities (and their business associates) to make their own assessment of <br/>
what ePHI is reasonably necessary for a particular purpose, given the characteristics of their <br/>
business and workforce. To qualify for this proposed sub-exception, the actor’s privacy policies <br/>
and procedures would need to identify criteria for making a “minimum necessary” determination <br/>
for both routine and non-routine disclosures and requests, including identifying the <br/>
circumstances under which disclosing the entire medical record is reasonably necessary. For <br/>
actors that are covered entities or business associates, the development of policies and <br/>
procedures for the making of minimum necessary determinations for requesting, using and <br/>
disclosing PHI is already a requirement of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, so we expect that actors will <br/>
already have such policies and procedures in place. If an actor implemented its organizational <br/>
policies and procedures for making “minimum necessary” determinations consistent with the <br/>
HIPAA Privacy Rule, and otherwise met the other conditions of this exception, a decision to <br/>
exchange the minimum necessary information but less information than requested by another <br/>
entity would satisfy this sub-exception and not be considered information blocking. <br/>
Finally, an actor’s policies and procedures must be implemented. This ensures that an actor <br/>
can only satisfy this condition by reference to privacy policies and practices that individuals in fact <br/>

Proper implementation would involve making the policies and processes available to all decision <br/>
makers, and facilitating workforce and contractor understanding and consistent implementation of <br/>
the actor’s policies and procedures such as by providing training. This condition ensures that this <br/>
sub-exception does not protect practices that are post hoc rationalizations used to justify improper <br/>
practices. <br/>
As discussed above, to the extent existing state and federal laws apply to a given actor, <br/>
we expect an actor to already have procedures in place to address those legal requirements. <br/>
Indeed, the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that covered entities have policies and procedures and <br/>
training programs in place that address how PHI and ePHI are used (as those terms are defined in <br/>
45 CFR 160.103) and disclosed. Moreover, this exception is only enlivened when an actor <br/>
asserts that its conduct was carried out to satisfy a precondition, and we expect that such conduct <br/>
should be considered and deliberate.  <br/>
We seek comment on this proposed condition generally, and specifically, on whether an <br/>
actor’s organizational policies and procedures provide a sufficiently robust and reliable basis for <br/>
evaluating the bona fides, reasonableness, and necessity of practices engaged in to satisfy <br/>
preconditions required by state or federal privacy laws. <br/>
<i>Documenting criteria and rationale </i><br/>
If an actor’s practice does not conform to an actor’s organizational policies and <br/>
procedures as required by § 171.202(b)(1), we propose that that an actor can seek to qualify for <br/>
this sub-exception, in part, by documenting how it reached its decision that it would not provide <br/>
access, use, or exchange of EHI on the basis that a precondition had not been satisfied. Such <br/>

 <br/>
documentation must be created on a case-by-case basis. An actor will not satisfy this condition <br/>
if, for instance, it sought to document a general practice that it had applied to all instances where <br/>
the precondition had not been satisfied. Rather, the record created by the actor must address the <br/>
specific circumstances of the specific practice (or interference) at issue. <br/>
The record created by the actor must identify the criteria used by the actor to determine <br/>
when the precondition is satisfied. That is, it must identify the objective criteria that the actor <br/>
applied to determine whether the precondition had been satisfied. Consistent with the condition <br/>
to this sub-exception that the practice must be tailored to the privacy interest at issue (discussed <br/>
below), those criteria would need to be directly relevant to satisfying the precondition. For <br/>
example, if the precondition at issue was the provision of a valid HIPAA authorization, the <br/>
actor’s documented record should reflect, at minimum, that the authorization would need to meet <br/>
each of the requirements specified for a valid authorization at 45 CFR 164.508(c). The record <br/>
would then need to document the criteria that had not been met, and the reason so. Continuing <br/>
the example, the actor could record that the authorization did not contain the name or other <br/>
specific identification of the person making the request because the authorization only disclosed <br/>
the person’s first initial rather than first name, and the actor had records about multiple people <br/>
with that same initial and last name.  <br/>
We believe that this condition will provide the transparency necessary to demonstrate <br/>
whether the actor has satisfied the conditions applicable to this exception. Moreover, it will <br/>
ensure that a decision to not provide access, exchange, or use of EHI is considered and <br/>
deliberate, and therefore reasonable and necessary. <br/>
We seek comment on this proposed condition. <br/>

<i>Meaningful opportunity to provide consent or authorization </i><br/>
If the precondition that an actor purports to have satisfied relies on the provision of a <br/>
consent or authorization from an individual, it is a condition of this sub-exception that the actor <br/>
must have done all things reasonably necessary within its control to provide the individual with a <br/>
meaningful opportunity to provide that consent or authorization. This condition will be relevant <br/>
when, for example, a state privacy law or the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires an individual to <br/>
provide their consent and/or HIPAA authorization before identifiable information can be <br/>
accessed, exchanged, or used for specific purposes. For instance, a state law may require that an <br/>
individual provide consent before a hospital can share her treatment information electronically <br/>
with another treating health care provider. Under this scenario, the hospital’s refusal to exchange <br/>
the EHI in the absence of the individual’s consent would be reasonable and necessary and would <br/>
not be information blocking, so long as the hospital had provided the individual with a <br/>
meaningful opportunity to provide that consent and where the criteria and other conditions of this <br/>
proposed exception were met.  <br/>
In the context of the provision of consent, a meaningful opportunity would ordinarily <br/>
require that an actor provide the individual with a legally compliant consent form; make a <br/>
reasonable effort to inform an individual that she has the right to consent to the disclosure of her <br/>
EHI; and provide the individual with sufficient information and educational material <br/>
(commensurate with the circumstances of the disclosure). It would be best practice for an actor to <br/>
also inform the individual about the revocability of any consent given, if and as provided in the <br/>
relevant state or federal privacy law, and the actor’s processes for acting on any revocation. <br/>

 <br/>
We are considering addressing this condition in further detail, whether by way of <br/>
additional guidance or in regulation text. To this end, we seek comments regarding what actions <br/>
an actor should take, within the actor’s control, to provide an individual with a meaningful <br/>
opportunity to provide a required consent or authorization, and whether different expectations <br/>
should arise in the context of a consent versus a HIPAA authorization. For example, commenters <br/>
may wish to provide comment on the actions to be taken to ensure that an individual has a <br/>
meaningful opportunity to satisfy a precondition that the individual provide a HIPAA <br/>
authorization. Specifically, in the context of a requirement that the authorization be signed, what <br/>
effort should be expected from actors in seeking signatures from: (i) persons acting for the <br/>
patient where the patient is unable to sign a form; (ii) former patients whose EHI is being <br/>
requested from third parties; or (iii) patients that are not in a facility, such as patients of <br/>
individual physicians? <br/>
We clarify that after providing the individual with a meaningful opportunity to consent or <br/>
provide authorization, we believe that it is the individual’s responsibility to complete any <br/>
required documentation before an actor is able to access, exchange, or use the individual’s EHI. <br/>
We do not expect the actor to “chase” the individual despite using its best efforts provide the <br/>
individual with an opportunity to sign a consent or authorization form. So long as the actor has <br/>
provided the individual with a meaningful opportunity to consent, the actor will have fulfilled <br/>
this aspect of the eligibility requirements of this sub-exception. <br/>
Separately, to qualify for this sub-exception, to the extent that the precondition at issue <br/>
was the provision of a consent or authorization by an individual, the actor must not have <br/>
improperly encouraged or induced the individual to not provide the consent or authorization. <br/>

This does not mean that the hospital cannot inform an individual about the advantages and <br/>
disadvantages of exchanging EHI and any associated risks, so long as the information <br/>
communicated is accurate and legitimate. However, an actor would not meet this condition in the <br/>
event that it misled an individual about the nature of the consent to be provided, dissuaded <br/>
individuals from providing consent in respect of disclosures to the actor’s competitors, or <br/>
imposed onerous requirements to effectuate consent that were unnecessary and not required by <br/>
law.  <br/>
We seek comment on whether the proposed condition requiring the provision of a <br/>
meaningful opportunity and prohibiting improper encouragement or inducement should apply to <br/>
preconditions beyond the precondition that an individual provide consent or authorization. We <br/>
seek comment on whether the conditions specified for this sub-exception, when taken in total, <br/>
are sufficiently particularized and sufficiently strict to ensure that actors that are in a position to <br/>
influence whether a precondition is satisfied will not be able to take advantage of this sub-<br/>
exception and seek protection for practices that do not promote the privacy of EHI. We also seek <br/>
comment on whether we should adopt a more tailored approach to conditioning the availability <br/>
of this exception. For example, we are considering whether different conditions should apply <br/>
depending on: (i) the nature of the EHI at issue; (ii) the circumstances in which the EHI is being <br/>
access, exchanged, or used; (iii) the interest being protected by the precondition; or (iv) the <br/>
nature of the precondition to be satisfied. Commenters are encouraged to identify scenarios in <br/>
which the application of the conditions applicable to this sub-exception, as proposed, give rise to <br/>
unnecessary burden, or would require activities that do not advance the dual policy interests of <br/>
preventing information blocking and promoting privacy and security. <br/>

<i>Practice must be tailored to the specific privacy risk or interest being addressed </i><br/>
To qualify for this sub-exception, an actor’s privacy-protective practice must be tailored <br/>
to the specific privacy risks that the practice actually addresses. This condition necessarily <br/>
presupposes that an actor has carefully evaluated the privacy requirements imposed on the actor, <br/>
the privacy interests to be managed by the actor, and has developed a considered response that is <br/>
tailored to protecting and promoting the privacy of EHI. For example, the HIPAA Privacy Rule <br/>
at 45 CFR 164.514(h) requires that, in certain circumstances, the disclosure of PHI is only <br/>
authorized once the identity and authority of the person requesting the information has been <br/>
verified. The privacy issue to be addressed in this instance is the risk that PHI will be disclosed <br/>
to the wrong individual, or an unauthorized person. If an actor chooses not to provide access, <br/>
exchange, or use of EHI on the basis that the actor’s identity verification requirements have not <br/>
been satisfied, the actor’s practice must be tailored to the specific privacy risks at issue. This <br/>
would require that the actor ensure that it does not impose identity verification requirements that <br/>
are unreasonably onerous under the circumstances.  <br/>
To illustrate, a policy where a driver’s license was the only accepted government-issued <br/>
form of identification would not be a practice that is tailored to the privacy risk at issue because <br/>
the provider’s preference for one form of government-issued identification over another does not <br/>
meaningfully manage the privacy risk. Similarly, it may be unreasonable for an actor to require <br/>
the production of documentation demonstrating the parent-child relationship unless the actor was <br/>
in possession of information that suggested that an adult might not have authority to be the <br/>
child’s legal representative. To do otherwise would be to apply an onerous requirement in all <br/>
instances of parent-child relationships, which is insufficiently tailored to the privacy risk being <br/>

original identification if the individual was able to furnish a scanned copy of their form of <br/>
identification that the actor could reasonably rely on. <br/>
For the purposes of this sub-exception, we clarify that engaging in an interference on the <br/>
basis that a precondition has not been satisfied would be a practice that addresses a privacy risk <br/>
or interest, and so tailoring that interference to satisfy a precondition can satisfy this condition. <br/>
Controls on access, exchange, or use arising under privacy laws serve a privacy interest and so <br/>
this condition will be met so long as the actor’s practice is tailored to the risk or interest being <br/>
addressed. <br/>
We seek comment on this proposed condition. <br/>
<i>Practice must be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner. </i><br/>
We propose that in order for a practice to qualify for this sub-exception, the practice must <br/>
be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner. This condition would provide <br/>
basic assurance that the purported privacy practice is directly related to a specific privacy risk <br/>
and is not being used to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI for other purposes to <br/>
which this exception does not apply.  <br/>
This condition requires that the actor’s privacy-protective practices must be based on <br/>
objective criteria that apply uniformly for all substantially similar privacy risks. An actor could <br/>
not, for example, implement an organizational privacy policy that imposed unreasonably onerous <br/>
requirements on a certain class of individuals or entities without a legitimate justification for <br/>
doing so. For example, an actor that offered a patient-facing software application (app) would <br/>
not be able to benefit from this exception if it refused to exchange EHI with a competitor app on <br/>

<i>Sub-exception to proposed privacy exception: Health IT developer of certified health IT not </i><br/>
<i>covered by HIPAA</i> <br/>
The sub-exception proposed in § 171.202(b) recognizes as reasonable and necessary the <br/>
activities engaged in by actors consistent with the controls placed on access, exchange, or use of <br/>
EHI by federal and state privacy laws. Importantly, that sub-exception is limited to actors that <br/>
are subject to those federal and state privacy laws; an actor that is not regulated by HIPAA or a <br/>
state privacy law cannot benefit from the exception proposed in § 171.202(b). <br/>
We propose to establish a sub-exception to the information blocking provision that would <br/>
apply to actors that are health IT developers of certified health IT but not regulated by the <br/>
HIPAA Privacy Rule in respect to the operation of the actor’s health IT product or service <br/>
(referred to hereafter as “non-covered actors”). We expect that the class of actors to which this <br/>
proposed sub-exception applies will be very small. The vast majority of health IT developers of <br/>
certified health IT operate as business associates to health care providers or health plans, are <br/>
regulated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and will be able to benefit from the exception proposed in <br/>
§ 171.202(b) to the extent that the HIPAA Privacy Rule (or applicable state privacy law) imposes <br/>
preconditions to the provision of access, exchange, or use of EHI. However, we recognize that <br/>

direct-to-consumer health IT products and services are a growing sector of the health IT market. <br/>
This class of health IT is often not regulated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but could be certified <br/>
under the Program. We note that the privacy practices of consumer-facing health IT products and <br/>
services are typically regulated by the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). However, the <br/>
FTC Act applies to acts and practices that are unfair and deceptive (15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1)), and <br/>
does not prescribe privacy requirements to be adopted or followed that can be leveraged for the <br/>
purpose of recognizing reasonable and necessary privacy-protective practices in this proposed <br/>
rule.<a href="ONCs.html#420">118 </a><br/>
As discussed in section VIII.C.2.b, where a health IT developer of certified health IT <br/>
offers a health IT product or service not regulated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, such product or <br/>
service is subject to the information blocking provision. We want to ensure that non-covered <br/>
actors that engage in reasonable and necessary privacy-protective practices that interfere with the <br/>
access, exchange, or use of EHI can seek coverage under this proposed sub-exception. As such, <br/>
we propose that a non-covered actor will not engage in information blocking if the actor does not <br/>
provide access, exchange, or use of EHI where the practice implements a process that is <br/>
described in the actor’s organizational privacy policy and has been disclosed to any individual or <br/>
entity that uses the actor’s health IT. This proposed sub-exception is proposed in § 171.202(c). <br/>
As a threshold requirement of this sub-exception, the actor’s practice of interfering with <br/>
access, exchange, or use of EHI must comply with any applicable state or federal privacy laws. <br/>

protective practices that are not regulated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we acknowledge that <br/>
there may be other privacy laws implicated by the practice in question. If the actor’s practice <br/>
contravenes a state or federal privacy law, but otherwise satisfies this proposed sub-exception, <br/>
the actor would not be entitled to benefit from this sub-exception. <br/>
<i>Practice must implement privacy policy </i><br/>
In order to qualify for this sub-exception, the practice engaged in by the non-covered <br/>
actor —the interference with access, exchange, or use of EHI—must also implement a process <br/>
described in the actor’s organizational privacy policy. This requires that a non-covered actor <br/>
must have documented in detail in its organizational privacy policy the processes and procedures <br/>
that the actor will use to determine when the actor will not provide access, exchange, or use of <br/>
EHI. For example, a non-covered actor that proposed to require the provision of written consent <br/>
for the use or disclosure of EHI would need to describe in its organizational privacy policy the <br/>
processes and procedures to be utilized by the actor to implement that privacy-protective practice <br/>
in order that the practice be considered reasonable and necessary and qualify for this sub-<br/>
exception. A privacy policy that was prepared at a high level—for example, that simply stated <br/>
that written consent was required—would not qualify. To build on this example, a non-covered <br/>
actor’s consent policy would need to describe the specific requirements that are imposed on <br/>
individuals when giving consent, together with the processes and procedures to be followed by <br/>
the non-covered actor to ensure that the individual has a meaningful choice over whether to <br/>
consent. Compliance with this condition ensures that this sub-exception recognizes only <br/>
legitimate practices that have been tailored to the privacy needs of the individuals that use the <br/>

non-covered actor’s health IT, and does not recognize practices that are a pretext or after-the-fact <br/>
rationalization for actions that interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. <br/>
It necessarily follows that the non-covered actor’s practice must implement its <br/>
documented organizational privacy policy. For example, if a non-covered actor chose not to <br/>
provide access, exchange, or use of EHI on the basis that it could not verify the identity of the <br/>
individual requesting the EHI, the non-covered actor would need to be able to demonstrate that it <br/>
implemented the part of its organizational privacy policy that dealt with identity verification. <br/>
Practices that diverge from an actor’s documented policies or practices, or which are not <br/>
addressed in an actor’s organizational privacy policy, would not qualify for this proposed sub-<br/>
exception. <br/>
<i>Practice must have been disclosed to users </i><br/>
A non-covered actor that seeks to benefit from this proposed sub-exception must also <br/>
ensure that it has previously disclosed the privacy-protective practice to the individuals and <br/>
entities that use, or will use, the health IT. These users are affected by the practices engaged in <br/>
by a non-covered actor but may otherwise have no visibility of the non-covered actor’s approach <br/>
to protecting the privacy of EHI. We expect that non-covered actors will seek to satisfy this <br/>
condition by using a privacy notice.<a href="ONCs.html#422">119</a> We emphasize that the disclosure must be meaningful. In <br/>
assessing whether a non-covered actor’s disclosure was meaningful, regard will be paid to <br/>
whether the disclosure was in plain language and conspicuous, including whether the disclosure <br/>

was located in a place, and presented in a manner, that is accessible and obvious to the <br/>
individuals and entities that use, or will use, the health IT.  <br/>
To qualify for this sub-exception, a non-covered actor would not be required to disclose <br/>
its organizational privacy policy to its customers or to the public generally. Rather, the non-<br/>
covered actor need only describe, with sufficient detail and precision to be readily understood by <br/>
users of the non-covered actor’s health IT, the privacy-protective practices that the non-covered <br/>
actor has adopted and will observe. This is necessary because a non-covered actor that is not <br/>
subject to prescribed privacy standards in connection with the provision of health IT will have <br/>
significant flexibility in the privacy-protective practices that it adopts. If an actor is not required <br/>
to inform the individuals and entities that use, or will use, the health IT, about the privacy-<br/>
protective practices that it will implement in its product, or when providing its service, there is a <br/>
risk that this proposed sub-exception will give deference to policies and processes that are post <br/>
hoc rationalizations used to justify improper practices. This condition also serves as a check on <br/>
the nature of the interferences that a non-covered actor writes into its organizational privacy <br/>
policies; transparency will help to ensure that a non-covered actor takes a balanced approach to <br/>
protecting privacy interests on one hand, and pursuing business interests that might be <br/>
inconsistent with the information blocking provision, on the other hand. We hope that this <br/>
requirement will foster a quasi-market based measure of when a privacy-protective practice is <br/>
“reasonable and necessary,” and ensure that any departure made by a non-covered actor from <br/>
privacy practices that are recognized by state or federal law is transparent and open.  <br/>
It will be a matter for non-covered actors to determine the most appropriate way to <br/>
communicate its privacy practices to users. We believe that it would be reasonable that non-<br/>

conditions in connection with § 171.202(b) applies to this proposed exception in § 171.202(c). <br/>
We refer readers to the above discussion and invite comments on these proposed conditions. <br/>
We seek comment on this proposed sub-exception generally. Specifically, we seek <br/>
comment on whether HIEs or HINs would benefit from a similar sub-exception. We also seek <br/>
comment on whether the conditions applicable to this sub-exception are sufficient to ensure that <br/>
non-covered actors cannot take advantage of this exception by engaging in practices that are <br/>
inconsistent with the promotion of individual privacy. We also seek comment on the level of <br/>
detail that non-covered actors should be required to use when describing their privacy practices <br/>
and processes to user of health IT. <br/>

PHI in the circumstances provided under 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1), (2), and (3). We believe this <br/>
exception would avoid a potential conflict between the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the information <br/>
blocking provision. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule contemplates circumstances under <br/>
which covered entities, and in some instances business associates, may deny an individual access <br/>
to PHI and distinguishes those grounds for denial which are reviewable from those which are <br/>
not. This exception applies to both the “unreviewable grounds” and “reviewable grounds” of <br/>
access. The “unreviewable grounds” for denial for individuals include situations involving: (1) <br/>
certain requests that are made by inmates of correctional institutions; (2) information created or <br/>
obtained during research that includes treatment, if certain conditions are met; (3) denials <br/>
permitted by the Privacy Act; and (4) information obtained from non-health care providers <br/>
pursuant to promises of confidentiality. In addition, two categories of information are expressly <br/>
excluded from the individual right of access: (1) psychotherapy notes, which are the personal <br/>
notes of a mental health care provider documenting or analyzing the contents of a counseling <br/>
session that are maintained separate from the rest of the patient’s medical record (<i>see</i> 45 CFR <br/>
164.524(a)(1)); and (2) information compiled in reasonable anticipation of, or for use in, a civil, <br/>
criminal, or administrative action or proceeding (<i>see </i>45 CFR 164.501).  <br/>
The “reviewable grounds” of access as described in § 164.524(a)(3), which provides that <br/>
a covered entity may deny access provided that the individual is given a right to have such <br/>
denials reviewed under certain circumstances. One such circumstance is when a licensed health <br/>
care professional, in the exercise of professional judgment, determines that the access requested <br/>
is reasonably likely to endanger the life or physical safety of the individual or another person. In <br/>
addition, if access is denied, then the individual has the right to have the denial reviewed by a <br/>

licensed health professional who is to act as a reviewing official and did not participate in the <br/>
original decision to deny access<i> </i>(<i>see generally </i>45 CFR 164.524(a)(3)). <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that if an actor who is a covered entity or business associate denies an <br/>
individual’s request for access to their PHI on the basis of these unreviewable and reviewable <br/>
grounds, and provided the denial of access complies with the requirements of the HIPAA <br/>
Privacy Rule in each case, then the actor would qualify for this exception and these practices <br/>
would not constitute information blocking.  <br/>
 <br/>
The following example illustrates this proposed sub-exception. An individual is a patient <br/>
of a psychiatrist who is a HIPAA covered entity. The patient has requested all of his electronic <br/>
health files from the psychiatrist. The psychiatrist maintains separately from the electronic health <br/>
record a file containing psychotherapy notes regarding the patient. The psychiatrist grants access <br/>
to the patient by providing a copy of the information in his electronic health record, but does not <br/>
provide the patient’s psychotherapy notes. Under this example, the psychiatrist would meet the <br/>
requirements of this proposed exception since the HIPAA Privacy Rule provides that covered <br/>
entities can deny individuals access to their psychotherapy notes and provides that this is an <br/>
unreviewable grounds for denial.  <br/>
We seek comment on this proposed sub-exception. <br/>

We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking provision that would, in <br/>

individual has specifically requested that the actor not do so. This sub-exception is proposed in § <br/>

171.202(e). We believe this sub-exception is necessary to ensure that actors are confident that <br/>
they can respect individuals’ privacy choices without engaging in information blocking, and to <br/>
promote public confidence in the health IT infrastructure by effectuating patients’ preference <br/>
about how and under what circumstances their EHI will be accessed, exchanged, and used. We <br/>
recognize that individuals may have concerns about permitting their EHI to be accessed, <br/>
exchanged, or used electronically under certain circumstances. As a matter of public policy, we <br/>
think that these privacy concerns, if expressed by an individual and agreed to by an actor, would <br/>
be reasonable and necessary, and an actor’s conduct in abiding by its agreement would, if all <br/>
conditions are met, be an exception to the information blocking provision.  <br/>
This proposed sub-exception would not apply under circumstances where an actor <br/>
interferes with a use or disclosure of EHI that is required by law, including when EHI is required <br/>
by the Secretary to enforce HIPAA under 45 CFR 164.502(a)(2)(ii) and 45 CFR <br/>
164.502(a)(4)(i). Stated differently, this sub-exception would not operate to permit an actor to <br/>
refuse to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI when that access, exchange, or use is required <br/>
by law. This sub-exception recognizes and supports the public policy objective of the HIPAA <br/>
Privacy Rule, which identifies uses and disclosures of EHI for which the public interest in the <br/>
disclosure of the individual’s information outweighs the individual’s interests in controlling the <br/>
information. <br/>
This sub-exception would permit an actor not to share EHI if the following conditions are <br/>
met: (1) the individual made the request to the actor not to have his or her EHI accessed, <br/>
exchanged, or used; (2) the individual’s request was initiated by the individual without any <br/>

 <br/>
improper encouragement or inducement by the actor; and (3) the actor or its agent documents the <br/>
request within a reasonable time period.  <br/>
 <br/>
To qualify for this sub-exception, the request that the individual’s EHI not be accessed, <br/>
exchanged, or used must come from the individual. Moreover, the individual must have made the <br/>
request independently and without any improper encouragement or inducement by the actor. For <br/>
example, it would be improper to encourage individuals not to share information with <br/>
unaffiliated providers on the basis of generalized or speculative risks of unauthorized disclosure. <br/>
On the other hand, if the actor was aware of a specific privacy or security risk, it would not be <br/>
improper to inform individuals of that risk. Likewise, an actor would be permitted to provide an <br/>
individual with general information about her privacy rights and options, including for example, <br/>
the option to not provide consent, provided the information is presented accurately, does not omit <br/>
important information, and is not presented in a way that is likely to improperly influence the <br/>
individual’s decision about how to exercise their rights.  <br/>
 <br/>
If an individual submits a request to an actor not to disclose her EHI, and the actor agrees <br/>
with and documents the request, the request would be valid for purposes of this sub-exception <br/>
unless and until it is subsequently revoked by the individual. We believe this approach would <br/>
minimize compliance burdens for actors while also respecting individuals’ requests. We propose <br/>
that once the individual makes the request, she should not, subject to the requirements of <br/>
applicable federal or state laws and regulations, have to continually reiterate her privacy <br/>
preferences, such as having to re-submit a request every year. Likewise, we propose that once the <br/>
actor has documented an individual’s request, the actor should not have to repeatedly reconfirm <br/>
and re-document the request. We seek comment, however, regarding whether this approach is <br/>

too permissive and could result in unintended consequences. We also seek comment on this <br/>
proposed sub-exception generally, including on effective ways for an individual to revoke his or <br/>
her privacy request for purposes of this sub-exception.  <br/>
We also propose that in order for a practice to qualify for this sub-exception, an actor’s <br/>
practice must be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner. This condition <br/>
would provide basic assurance that the purported privacy practice is directly related to the risk of <br/>
disclosing EHI contrary to the wishes of an individual, and is not being used to interfere with <br/>
access, exchange, or use of EHI for other purposes to which this exception does not apply. This <br/>
condition requires that the actor’s privacy-protective practice must be based on objective criteria <br/>
that apply uniformly for all substantially similar privacy risks. <br/>
We note that under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, individuals have the right to request <br/>
restrictions on how a covered entity will use (as that term is defined in 45 CFR160.103) and <br/>
disclose PHI about them for treatment, payment, and health care operations pursuant to 45 CFR <br/>
164.522(a)(1). Under § 164.522(a), a covered entity is not required to agree to an individual’s <br/>
request for a restriction (other than in the case of a disclosure to a health plan under § <br/>
164.522(a)(1)(vi)), but is bound by any restrictions to which it agrees.  <br/>
We wish to clarify that, for the purposes of this proposed sub-exception, the actor may <br/>
give effect to an individual’s request not to have an actor disclose EHI even if state or federal <br/>
laws would allow the actor not to follow the individual’s request. This is consistent with our <br/>
position that, absent improper encouragement or inducement, and subject to appropriate <br/>
conditions, it should not be considered information blocking to give effect to patients’ individual <br/>
preferences about how their EHI will be shared or not. As an illustration, if an individual <br/>

at a hospital, the physician may agree not to use the individual’s EHI for this purpose despite the <br/>
fact it would not be required by law to agree to such a restriction. Provided the physician has not <br/>
encouraged or induced the individual to make this request, this sub-exception would apply to the <br/>
physician’s refusal to disclose the information to staff for training purposes.  <br/>
We seek comments on this sub-exception generally. Specifically, we seek comment on <br/>
what would be considered a reasonable time frame for documentation. In addition, we also seek <br/>
comment on how this sub-exception would affect public health disclosures and health care <br/>
research, if an actor did not share a patient’s EHI due to a privacy preference, including any <br/>
effects on preventing or controlling diseases, injury, or disability, and the reporting of disease, <br/>
injury, and vital events such as births or deaths, and the conduct of public health surveillance and <br/>
health care research. <br/>
3. Promoting the Security of EHI <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking provision that would <br/>
permit actors to engage in practices that are reasonable and necessary to promote the security of <br/>
EHI, subject to certain conditions. Without this exception, actors may be reluctant to implement <br/>
security measures or engage in other activities that are reasonable and necessary for safeguarding <br/>
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EHI. This could undermine the ultimate goals of <br/>
the information blocking provision by discouraging best practice security protocols and <br/>
diminishing the reliability of the health IT ecosystem.  <br/>
 <br/>
Robust security protections are critical to promoting patients’ and other stakeholders’ <br/>
trust and confidence that EHI will be collected, used, and shared in a manner that protects <br/>

individuals’ privacy and complies with applicable legal requirements. Public confidence in the <br/>
security of their EHI has been challenged, however, by the growing incidence of cyber-attacks in <br/>
the health care sector. More than ever, health care providers, health IT developers, HIEs and <br/>
HINs must be vigilant to mitigate security risks and implement appropriate safeguards to secure <br/>
the EHI they collect, maintain, access, use, and exchange. <br/>
 <br/>
The Cures Act directs the National Coordinator, in consultation with the HHS Office for <br/>
Civil Rights (OCR), to issue guidance on common “security barriers” that prevent the trusted <br/>
exchange of EHI (section 3022(c)(2) of the PHSA). However, the Cures Act also seeks to <br/>
promote the security of EHI, which it defines as an element of interoperability (section <br/>
3000(9)(A) of the PHSA) and a target area for the policy development to be undertaken by the <br/>
Health Information Technology Advisory Committee (section 3002(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the PHSA). <br/>
The inclusion of these provisions promote broader access, exchange, and use of EHI while at the <br/>
same time continuing to promote the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EHI through <br/>
security practices that are appropriate and tailored to identified vulnerabilities and risks.  <br/>
To qualify for this exception, we propose that an actor’s conduct must satisfy threshold <br/>
conditions. As discussed in detail below, the particular security-related practice must be directly <br/>
related to safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EHI, implemented <br/>
consistently and in a non-discriminatory manner, and tailored to identified security risks.  <br/>
While the importance of security practices cannot be overstated, this proposed exception <br/>
would not apply to <i>all</i> practices that purport to secure EHI. Rather, this exception will only be <br/>
available when the actor’s security-based practice satisfies the conditions applicable to this <br/>
exception. We do not believe it would be appropriate to prescribe a “maximum” level of security <br/>

or to dictate a one-size-fits-all approach for all actors that may not be appropriate in all <br/>
circumstances and may not accommodate new threats, countermeasures, and best practices in a <br/>
rapidly changing security landscape. Indeed, security infrastructure varies from organization to <br/>
organization, and there exist diverse approaches and technology solutions to managing security <br/>
risks. We do not intend for this proposed exception to dictate a specific security approach when <br/>
an actor’s security posture must be agile and its practices iterative. Moreover, effective security <br/>
best practices focus on the mitigation and remediation of risks to a reasonable and acceptable <br/>
level, and not the elimination of all vulnerabilities, so organizations should have the flexibility to <br/>
assess what vulnerabilities to address and how best to address them while ensuring the <br/>
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EHI.  <br/>
As such, we propose that actors would be able to satisfy this exception through practices <br/>
that implement either security policies and practices developed by the actor, or case-by-case <br/>
determinations made by the actor. Whether a security-motivated practice meets this exception <br/>
would be determined on a case-by-case basis using a fact-based analysis of the conditions set <br/>
forth below. This approach offers the most appropriate framework for analyzing security <br/>
practices, which are necessarily driven by and must be tailored to actors’ individual <br/>
circumstances.  <br/>
We wish to emphasize that the security-based practices implemented by a single <br/>
physician office with limited technology resources, for example, will be different to those <br/>
implemented by a large health system, and that this difference does not affect an actor’s ability to <br/>
qualify for this exception. The fact-based approach we propose will allow each actor to <br/>

organizational structure, and risks to individuals’ EHI.  <br/>
 <br/>
A fact-based analysis also aligns with the HIPAA Security Rule<a href="ONCs.html#433">120</a> concerning the <br/>
security of ePHI. The HIPAA Security Rule does not dictate the security measures that a covered <br/>
entity or business associate must implement, but instead requires the entity to develop security <br/>
practices and implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that take into account <br/>
the entity’s size, complexity, and capabilities; technical, hardware, and software infrastructure; <br/>
the costs of security measures; and the likelihood and possible impact of potential risks to ePHI. <br/>
Under the HIPAA Security Rule, covered entities and business associates are required to conduct <br/>
an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the <br/>
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI held by the covered entity or business <br/>
associate. Once covered entities and business associates have completed the risk assessment, <br/>
they must take security measures sufficient to reduce identified risks and vulnerabilities to <br/>
reasonable and appropriate levels (45 CFR 164.308(a)(1)(ii)). We note, however, that while our <br/>
approach is consistent with the regulation of security practices under the HIPAA Security Rule, <br/>
the fact that a practice complies with the HIPAA Security Rule does not establish that it meets <br/>
the conditions of this proposed exception to the information blocking provision. The HIPAA <br/>
Security Rule and this proposed exception have different focuses. The HIPAA Security Rule <br/>
establishes a baseline by requiring certain entities to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and <br/>
availability of ePHI by implementing security measures, among other safeguards, that the entities <br/>
determine are sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level. <br/>

In contrast, the purpose of this exception to the information blocking provision is to provide <br/>
flexibility for reasonable and necessary security practices while screening out practices that <br/>
purport to promote the security of EHI but that are unreasonably broad, onerous on those seeking <br/>
access to the EHI, are not applied consistently across/within an organization, or otherwise may <br/>
unreasonably interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI.  <br/>
We propose the following conditions that must be met for an activity or practice to <br/>
qualify for this exception.  <br/>
<i>The practice must be directly related to safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and </i><br/>
<i>availability of EHI. </i><br/>
 <br/>
As a threshold condition, the proposed exception would not apply to any practices that <br/>
are not directly related to safeguarding the security of EHI. In assessing the practice, we would <br/>
consider whether and to what extent the practice directly addressed specific security risks or <br/>
concerns. We would also consider whether the practice served any other purposes and, if so, <br/>
whether those purposes were merely incidental to the overriding security purpose or provided an <br/>
objectively distinct, non-security-related rationale for engaging in the practice.  <br/>
 <br/>
We note that it should not be particularly difficult or onerous for an actor to demonstrate, <br/>
as contemplated above, that its practice was directly related to a specific security risk or concern. <br/>
For example, the actor may show that the practice was a direct response to a known security <br/>
incident or threat; or that the practice directly related to the need to verify a person’s identity <br/>
before granting access to EHI; or that the practice was directly related to ensuring the integrity of <br/>
EHI.  <br/>

The salient issue under this condition, therefore, would be whether the security practice <br/>
was actually necessary and directly related to safeguarding EHI. To that end, we would consider <br/>
the actor’s purported basis for adopting the particular security practice, which could be <br/>
evidenced by the actor’s organizational security policy, risk assessments, and other relevant <br/>
documentation, which most actors are already required to develop pursuant to requirements <br/>
under the HIPAA Rules.<a href="ONCs.html#435">121</a> However, we propose that the documentation of an actor’s decision-<br/>
making would not necessarily be dispositive. For example, if the practice had the practical effect <br/>
of disadvantaging competitors or steering referrals, this could be evidence that the practice was <br/>
not directly related to the safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EHI. We <br/>
propose that such an inference would also not be warranted where the actor has not met the other <br/>
conditions of this exception proposed below, as where the actor’s policies were not developed or <br/>
implemented in a reasonable manner; its security policies or practices were not tailored to <br/>
specific risks; or it applied its security policies or practices in an inconsistent or discriminatory <br/>
manner.  <br/>
<i>The practice must be tailored to the specific security risk being addressed. </i><br/>
 <br/>
To qualify for this exception, we propose that an actor’s security-related practice must be <br/>
tailored to specific security risks that the practice actually addressed. This condition necessarily <br/>
presupposes that an actor has carefully evaluated the risk posed by the security threat and <br/>
developed a considered response that is tailored to mitigating the vulnerabilities of the actor’s <br/>
health IT or other related systems. For example, the awareness of a security vulnerability in a <br/>
particular HIE’s technology may justify a health care provider’s suspending access to EHI from <br/>

that organization or by participants of that HIE, but only for the period in which the threat <br/>
persists. In contrast, a response that suspended access by all HIEs or that persisted even after the <br/>
HIE had addressed the security vulnerability in its technology would not be tailored to address <br/>
specific risks and would not meet this condition.  <br/>
 <br/>
As another example, it may be reasonable for a health care provider to refuse to grant <br/>
access to EHI when an individual has been unable to prove her identity. However, the actor’s <br/>
identity proofing practice would have to be tailored to address risks specifically associated with <br/>
the disclosure of EHI to unauthorized individuals. For example, identity proofing requirements <br/>
might be tailored if the practice is based on a risk assessment and best practice policies and <br/>
procedures and is applied consistently and in a non-discriminatory manner. However, we believe <br/>
an identity proofing requirement would not be tailored if it were not based on an objectively <br/>
reasonable security risk assessment and a careful consideration of alternative approaches that <br/>
could adequately address the specific risk of patient misidentification in a less restrictive fashion.  <br/>
 <br/>
As a final example, an actor’s decision to deny access to the EHI it maintains may be <br/>
reasonable if the practice responds to a request for EHI from a patient-facing website or <br/>
application that causes the actor's system to raise a malicious software detection alert or if the <br/>
request comes from a website or application listed on a security “blacklist.” However, we <br/>
propose that the actor’s response must be tailored to the specific threat. Among other things, the <br/>
denial of access must be limited to the patient and/or their personal software. So as to ensure that <br/>
the response is properly tailored, it would be best practice for actors to ensure that they <br/>
communicate to those persons whose access was denied the reason for the denial of access, and <br/>
communicate objective timeframes (if feasible to do so) and other parameters for when access <br/>

would be granted or restored. Moreover, we propose that, to the extent that the practice <br/>
implements an organizational security policy, the policy must align with applicable consensus-<br/>
based standards or best practices for responding to these types of incidents. Disagreement with <br/>
the individual about the worthiness of the third party as a recipient of EHI, or even concerns <br/>
about what the third party might do with the EHI, except for reasons such as those listed in the <br/>
“preventing harm” exception, are not acceptable reasons to deny an individual’s request. <br/>
<i>Practice must be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner. </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose that in order for a practice to qualify for this proposed exception, the actor’s <br/>
practice must have been implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner. This <br/>
condition would provide basic assurance that the purported security practice is directly related to <br/>
a specific security risk and is not being used to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI for <br/>
other purposes to which this exception does not apply.  <br/>
 <br/>
As an illustration solely of the non-discriminatory manner condition, consider a health IT <br/>
developer of certified health IT that offers apps to its customers via an app marketplace. If the <br/>
developer requires that third-party apps sold (or made available) via the developer’s app <br/>
marketplace meet certain security requirements, those security requirements must be imposed in <br/>
a non-discriminatory manner. This would mean, for example, that if a developer imposed a <br/>
requirement that third-party apps include two-factor authentication for patient access, the <br/>
developer would need to ensure that the same requirement was imposed on, and met by, all other <br/>
apps, including any apps made available by the developer itself. To note, such a developer <br/>
requirement must also meet the other conditions of this exception (e.g., the condition that the <br/>
practice<i> </i>be tailored to the specific security risk being addressed). <br/>

<i>Practices that implement an organizational security policy. </i><br/>
 <br/>
As discussed above, an actor’s approach to information security management will reflect <br/>
the actor’s particular size, organizational structure, and risk posture. Because of this, it is <br/>
important that actors develop and implement organizational policies that secure EHI. We <br/>
propose that, where an actor has documented security policies that align with applicable <br/>
consensus-based standards, and where the policies are implemented in a consistent and non-<br/>
discriminatory manner, a practice’s conformity with such policies would provide a degree of <br/>
assurance that the practice was reasonable and necessary to address specific security risks and <br/>
thus should not constitute information blocking. Conversely, a practice that went beyond an <br/>
actor’s established policies or practices by imposing security controls that were not documented, <br/>
would not qualify for this exception under this condition (although the actor may be able to <br/>
qualify under the alternative basis for practices that do not implement a security policy). Further, <br/>
such practices would be suspect under the information blocking provision if there were <br/>
indications that the actor’s security-related justifications were a pretext or after-the-fact <br/>
rationalizations for its actions or was otherwise unreasonable under the circumstances.  <br/>
We reiterate that, to the extent that an actor seeks to justify a practice on the basis of its <br/>
organizational security policies, such policies must be in writing and implemented in a consistent <br/>
and non-discriminatory manner. As noted above, what a policy requires will depend on the facts <br/>
and circumstances. However, we propose that to support a presumption that a practice conducted <br/>
pursuant to the actor’s security policy was reasonable, the policy would have to meet the <br/>
following conditions.  <br/>

•  <i>Risks identified and assessed</i>.<i> </i>The actor’s security policy must be informed by an assessment <br/>
of the security risks facing the actor. While we do not propose any requirements as to a risk <br/>
assessment, we note that a good risk assessment would use an approach consistent with <br/>

one or more applicable consensus-based standards or best practice guidance. At present, <br/>
examples of relevant best practices for development of security policies include, but are not <br/>
limited to: NIST-800-53 Rev. 5; the NIST Cybersecurity Framework; and NIST SP 800-100, <br/>
SP 800-37 Rev. 2, SP 800-39, as updated and as interpreted through formal guidance. Best <br/>
practice guidance on security policies is also developed by consensus standards bodies such <br/>
as ISO, IETF, or IEC. HIPAA covered entities and business associates may be able to <br/>
leverage their HIPAA Security Rule compliance activities and can, if they choose, align their <br/>
security policy with those parts of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework that are referenced in <br/>
the HIPAA Security Rule Crosswalk to NIST Cybersecurity Framework to satisfy this <br/>

•  <i>Objective timeframes and other parameters</i>.<i> </i>We propose that<i> </i>the actor’s security policy must <br/>
provide objective timeframes and common terminology used for identifying, responding to, <br/>
and addressing security incidents. Examples of acceptable sources for development of a <br/>
security response plan include: NIST Incident Response Procedure <br/>
<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final">(https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final),</a> US-CERT for interactions <br/>

As a point of clarification, we note that an actor’s compliance with the HIPAA Security <br/>
Rule (if applicable to the actor) would be relevant to, but not dispositive of, whether the actor’s <br/>
policies and procedures were objectively reasonable for the purpose of this exception. An actor’s <br/>
documentation of its security policies and procedures for compliance with the Security Rule may <br/>
not offer a basis to evaluate whether the actor’s security practices unnecessarily interfere with <br/>
access, use, or exchange of EHI. For example, it could be difficult to determine whether a <br/>
practice unnecessary interferes with exchange of EHI based on a review of the customized PHI <br/>
data flow diagram the actor prepared as part of its Security Rule risk analysis. We believe that a <br/>
documented policy that provides explicit references to consensus-based standards and best <br/>
practice guidance (such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework) offer an objective and robust <br/>
means for ONC and the OIG to evaluate the reasonableness of a particular security control for <br/>
the purpose of this exception.  <br/>
We recognize that, as a practical matter, some actors (such as small health care providers <br/>
or those with limited resources) may have organizational security policies that are less robust or <br/>
that otherwise fall short of the minimum conditions proposed above. As discussed immediately <br/>

below, we propose that in these circumstances an actor could still benefit from this proposed <br/>
exception by demonstrating that the practice at issue was objectively reasonable under the <br/>
circumstances, without regard to a formal policy.  <br/>
<i>Practices that do not implement an organizational security policy. </i><br/>
 <br/>
While we expect that most security practices engaged in by an actor will implement an <br/>
organizational policy, we recognize that EHI security may present novel and unexpected threats <br/>
that even a best-practice risk assessment and security policy cannot anticipate. If a practice that <br/>
does not implement an organizational policy is to qualify for this exception, however, it must <br/>
meet certain conditions. The actor’s practice must, based on the particularized facts and <br/>
circumstances, be necessary to mitigate the security risk. Importantly, we propose that the actor <br/>
would have to demonstrate that it considered reasonable and appropriate alternatives that could <br/>
have reduced the likelihood of interference with access, exchange, or use of EHI, and that there <br/>
were no reasonable and appropriate alternatives that were less likely to interfere with access, <br/>
exchange or use of EHI.  <br/>
 <br/>
We note that an actor’s consideration of reasonable and appropriate alternatives will <br/>
depend on the urgency and nature of the security threat in question. We anticipate that an actor’s <br/>
qualification for this exception would accommodate exigent circumstances. For example, we <br/>
would not expect an actor to delay the implementation of a security measure in response to an <br/>
emergency on the basis that it has not yet been able to initiate a fully realized risk assessment <br/>
process. However, we expect that in these exigent circumstances, where the actor has <br/>
implemented a security practice without first considering whether there were reasonable and <br/>
appropriate alternatives that were less likely to interfere with access, exchange or use of EHI, the <br/>

actor would expeditiously make any necessary changes to the practice based on the actor’s <br/>
consideration of reasonable and appropriate alternatives that are less likely to interfere with <br/>
access, exchange or use of EHI. We propose that the exception would apply in these instances so <br/>
long as an actor takes these steps and complies with all other applicable conditions.  <br/>
We encourage comment on these conditions and our overall approach to this proposed <br/>
exception, including whether our proposal provides adequate flexibility for actors to implement <br/>
measures that are commensurate to the threats they face, the technology infrastructure they <br/>
possess, and their overall security profiles and, equally important, whether this exception <br/>
adequately mitigates the risk that actors will adopt security policies that are unnecessarily <br/>
restrictive or engage in practices that unreasonably interfere with access, exchange, or use of <br/>
EHI. Commenters are encouraged to propose additional conditions that may be necessary to <br/>
ensure that the exception is tailored and does not extend protection to practices that are not <br/>
reasonable and necessary to promote the security of EHI and that could present information <br/>
blocking concerns. We also seek comment on whether the use of consensus-based standards and <br/>
guidance provides an appropriate reference point for the development of security policies. <br/>
Finally, commenters may wish to offer an alternative basis for identifying practices that do not <br/>
offer a security benefit (compared with available alternatives) but that cause an information <br/>
blocking harm by interfering with access, exchange, or use of EHI. <br/>
4. Recovering Costs Reasonably Incurred <br/>
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking provision that would <br/>
permit the recovery of certain costs reasonably incurred to provide access, exchange, or use of <br/>
EHI. The exception and corresponding conditions are set forth in the proposed regulation text in <br/>

§ 171.204. We interpret the definition of information blocking to include <i>any</i> fee that is likely to <br/>
interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI (see discussion in section VIII.C.4.c.iv). We <br/>
anticipate that this interpretation may be broader than necessary to address genuine information <br/>
blocking concerns and could have unintended consequences on innovation and competition. <br/>
Specifically, unless we establish an exception, actors may be unable to recover costs that they <br/>
reasonably incur to develop technologies and provide services that enhance interoperability. This <br/>
could undermine the ultimate goals of the information blocking provision by diminishing <br/>
incentives to invest in, develop, and disseminate interoperable technologies and services that <br/>
enable more robust access, exchange, and use of EHI. Therefore, we propose to establish an <br/>
exception that would permit the recovery of certain costs that we believe are unlikely to present <br/>
information blocking concerns and would generally promote innovation, competition, and <br/>
consumer welfare, provided certain conditions are met. We note that complying with the <br/>
requirements of this exception would not prevent an actor from making a profit in connection <br/>
with the provision of access, exchange, or use of EHI. Indeed, the costs recoverable under this <br/>
proposed exception could include a reasonable profit, provided that all applicable conditions <br/>
were met. <br/>
 <br/>
The exception would be subject to strict conditions to prevent its potential misuse. <br/>
Specifically, we are concerned that a broad or insufficiently tailored exception for the recovery <br/>
of costs could protect rent-seeking, opportunistic fees, and exclusionary practices that interfere <br/>
with the access, exchange, and use of EHI. These practices fall within the definition of <br/>
information blocking and reflect some of the most serious concerns that motivated its enactment <br/>
(<i>see</i> section VIII.B of this preamble). For example, in the Information Blocking Congressional <br/>

Report, we cited evidence of wide variation in fees charged for health IT products and services. <br/>
While we cautioned that the issue of fees is nuanced, and that variations in fees could be <br/>
attributable in part to different technology architectures, service models, capabilities, service <br/>
levels, and other factors, we concluded that these factors alone could not adequately explain all <br/>
of the variation in prices that we had observed. Based on these and other indications, we <br/>
concluded that some actors were engaging in opportunistic pricing practices or, in some cases, <br/>
charging prices designed to deter connectivity or exchange with competing technologies or <br/>
services.  <br/>
 <br/>
In the time since we published the Information Blocking Congressional Report, these <br/>
practices have persisted and, in certain respects, become more pronounced. In a national survey <br/>
of HIE executives published in 2017, 47% of respondents reported that EHR developers <br/>
“often/routinely” charge high fees for exchange that are unrelated to cost, and another 40% <br/>
reported that they “sometimes” do.<a href="ONCs.html#444">124 </a>Meanwhile, we have continued to receive credible <br/>
evidence of rent-seeking and other opportunistic behaviors, such as fees for data export and data <br/>
portability that are not plausibly related to any reasonable time, materials, or other costs that a <br/>
developer would reasonably incur to provide these services. And, while some practices described <br/>
in the Information Blocking Congressional Report have become less prevalent (such as the <br/>
charging of per-transaction fees), other practices have emerged that are equally concerning.  <br/>
 <br/>
As just one illustration, some EHR developers have begun conditioning access or use of <br/>
customer EHI on revenue-sharing or royalty agreements that bear no plausible relation to the <br/>

costs incurred by the EHR developer to grant access to the EHI. We have also heard of <br/>
discriminatory pricing policies that have the obvious purpose and effect of excluding competitors <br/>
from the use of interoperability elements. Many of the industry stakeholders who shared their <br/>
perspectives with us in listening sessions prior to this proposed rule, including several health IT <br/>
developers of certified health IT, condemned these practices and urged us to swiftly address <br/>
them.  <br/>
 <br/>
In light of these concerns, we propose that this exception would apply only to the <br/>
recovery of certain costs and only when the actor’s methods for recovering such costs comply <br/>
with certain conditions at all relevant times. As discussed in more detail below, these conditions <br/>
would require that the costs the actor recovered were reasonably incurred and did not reflect <br/>
costs that are speculative or subjective. Actors would also be required to allocate costs in an <br/>
appropriate manner and to use objective and permissible criteria when charging fees to recover <br/>
those costs. Further, the exception would not apply to certain fees, such as those based on the <br/>
profit or revenue associated with the use of EHI (either being earned by the actor, or that could <br/>
be realized by another individual or entity) that exceed the actor’s reasonable costs for providing <br/>
access, exchange, or use of the EHI. We specify certain prohibited fees below.  <br/>
Finally, the exception would provide additional conditions applicable to fees charged in <br/>
connection with: (1) the certified APIs described in § 170.404; and (2) the EHI export capability <br/>
proposed in § 170.315(b)(10) for the purposes of switching health IT or to provide patients their <br/>
electronic health information. We emphasize that access to EHI that is provisioned by supplying <br/>
some form of physical media, such as paper copies (where the EHI is printed out), or where EHI <br/>
is copied onto a CD or flash-drive, would not be a practice that implicated the information <br/>

blocking provision provided that the fee(s) charged for that access complied with HIPAA (45 <br/>
CFR 164.524(c)(4)). <br/>
 <br/>
Our intention with this exception is not to set any particular cost that would be considered <br/>
“reasonably incurred,” but rather to allow the market to define the appropriate price so long as <br/>
certain methods are followed and certain criteria are met. <br/>
<i>Requirement that costs be reasonably incurred.</i> <br/>
Regardless of the type of cost at issue, a basic condition of this proposed exception is that <br/>
any costs the actor seeks to recover must have been reasonably incurred to provide the relevant <br/>
interoperability elements to enable access, exchange, or use of EHI. Ultimately, whether a cost <br/>
was reasonably incurred will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. We believe this <br/>
fact-based approach is appropriate in light of the considerable diversity in the types of costs that <br/>
actors might incur and the range of factors that could bear on the reasonableness of those costs. <br/>
For example, the costs of developing software may vary with the purposes it is intended to serve, <br/>
the settings in which it will be deployed, the types and scope of capabilities included, and the <br/>
extent to which these development efforts build on existing development efforts and know-how. <br/>
Additionally, the costs of providing services, including the implementation of technology in <br/>
production environments, may vary based on the technology design or architecture, individual <br/>
customer needs, local implementation conditions, and other factors. An analysis of costs would <br/>
also account for different distribution and service models under which the costs are calculated. <br/>
We seek comment on these and other considerations that may be relevant to assessing the <br/>
reasonableness of costs incurred for purposes of this exception.   <br/>

 <br/>
To qualify for the exception, we propose that the method by which the actor seeks to <br/>
recover its costs must be reasonable and non-discriminatory. This would require that the actor <br/>
base its recovery of costs on objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly applied for all <br/>
substantially similar or similarly situated classes of persons and requests. We emphasize that this <br/>
proposal does not mean that the actor must apply the same prices or price terms for all persons or <br/>
classes of persons to whom it provides the services. However, any differences in prices or price <br/>
terms would have to be based on actual differences in the costs that the actor incurred or other <br/>
reasonable and non-discriminatory criteria. We further propose to require that the method by <br/>
which the actor recovers its costs must be reasonably related to the actor’s costs of providing the <br/>
type of access, exchange, or use to, or at the request of, the person or entity to whom the fee is <br/>
charged.  <br/>
 <br/>
We also propose that the method by which the actor recovers its costs must be reasonably <br/>
allocated among all customers to whom the technology or service is supplied, or for whom the <br/>
technology is supported. A reasonable allocation of costs would require that the actor allocate its <br/>
costs in accordance with criteria that are reasonable and between only those customers that either <br/>
cause the costs to be incurred or benefit from the associated supply or support of the technology. <br/>
If an actor developed technology that could be supplied to multiple customers with minimal <br/>
tailoring, the core costs of developing its technology should be allocated between those <br/>
customers when recovered as a fee. The actor would not be permitted to recover the total of its <br/>
core costs from each customer. Similarly, when an actor uses shared facilities and resources to <br/>
support the usage of technology, it would need to ensure that those shared costs were reasonably <br/>
allocated between all of the customers that benefited from them. However, whenever an actor is <br/>

 <br/>
required to provide services and incur costs that are unique to a particular customer, it would not <br/>
need to distribute those costs among other customers that had deployed technology. <br/>
In addition, the exception would not apply if the method by which the actor recovers its <br/>
costs is based, in any part, on whether the requestor or other person is a competitor, potential <br/>
competitor, or will be using the EHI in a way that facilitates competition with the actor. The use <br/>
of such criteria would be suspect because it suggests the fee the actor is charging is not based on <br/>
its reasonable costs to provide the services and may have the purpose or effect of excluding or <br/>
creating impediments for competitors, business rivals, or other persons engaged in developing or <br/>
enabling the use of interoperable technologies and services.  <br/>
Last, we propose that the method by which the actor recovers its costs must not be based <br/>
on the sales, profit, revenue, or other value that the requestor or other persons derive or may <br/>
derive from the access to, exchange of, or use of electronic health information, including the <br/>
secondary use of such information, that <i>exceeds</i> the actor’s reasonable costs for providing access, <br/>
exchange, or use of electronic health information. We emphasize that such revenue-sharing or <br/>
profit-sharing arrangements would <i>only</i> be acceptable and covered by the exception if such <br/>
arrangements are designed to provide an alternative way to recover the costs reasonably incurred <br/>
for providing services.  <br/>
 <br/>
We seek comment on these conditions and other issues we should consider in assessing <br/>
whether the methodology by which an actor distributes costs and charges fees should be <br/>
considered reasonable and necessary for purposes of this exception. In particular we are <br/>
considering whether to introduce specific factors and methods for assessing when profit will be <br/>
reasonable. For example, should the pro-competitive or efficiency-adding aspect of an actor’s <br/>

approach to providing access, exchange, or use of EHI be taken into account when assessing the <br/>
reasonableness of the profit recovered by an actor? We also ask commenters to consider whether <br/>
there are specific use cases for which actors’ profits should be limited or prohibited. We request <br/>
that commenters provide as much detail as possible when describing methods for quantifying <br/>
profits and evaluating their reasonableness.   <br/>
<i>Costs Specifically Excluded </i> <br/>
We propose that certain costs should be explicitly excluded from this exception <br/>
regardless of the method for recovering the costs. We have proposed these excluded costs, which <br/>
are detailed below, in an effort to provide additional clarity about the scope of this exception and <br/>
to create guardrails for preventing potential misuse of the exception.  <br/>
<i>Costs Due to Non-standard Design or Implementation Choices </i><br/>
We propose that this exception would not permit the recovery of any cost that the actor <br/>
incurred due to the health IT being designed or implemented in non-standard ways that <br/>
unnecessarily increase the complexity, difficulty or burden of accessing, exchanging, or using <br/>
EHI. To the extent that such costs can be reasonably avoided, we believe that actors should <br/>
internalize the costs of such behaviors, which do not benefit consumers, and which create <br/>
unnecessary impediments to access, exchange, and use of EHI. As an illustration, if a health IT <br/>
developer of certified health IT designed its database tables or other aspects of its technology in <br/>
ways that make exporting or converting EHI to other formats difficult, the developer could not <br/>
claim that its costs to provide data conversion services to customers are reasonably incurred. <br/>
Such costs would not be eligible under this exception (and might implicate the information <br/>
blocking provision for the reasons noted in section VIII.C.4.c.v of this preamble).  <br/>

 <br/>
We welcome comments on the exclusion of these types of costs.   <br/>
 <br/>
<i>Subjective or Speculative Costs </i><br/>
We propose to limit this exception to the recovery of costs that an actor <i>actually </i>incurred <br/>
to provide the relevant interoperability element or group of elements (which may comprise either <br/>
products or services). We propose that this exception would not permit the recovery of certain <br/>
types of costs that are subjective or speculative. We note two important examples of this <br/>
limitation.  <br/>
First, an actor would not be permitted to recover any costs associated with intangible <br/>
assets (including depreciation or loss of value), other than the actual development or acquisition <br/>
costs of such assets. For example, an actor could not charge a customer a fee based on the <br/>
purported “cost” of allowing the customer to use the actor’s patented technology, computer <br/>
software, databases, trade secrets, copyrighted works, and the like. We understand that the <br/>
customer’s use of the asset could be considered a “cost” in the sense that, were it not for the <br/>
information blocking provision, the actor could charge a royalty or other fee for the use of its <br/>
intangible assets. For this reason, in section VIII.D.6, we propose to permit an actor to license <br/>
most interoperability elements on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, subject to certain <br/>
conditions. For purposes of this more general exception, however, we believe it would be <br/>
inappropriate to permit an actor to charge a fee based on these considerations, which are <br/>
inherently subjective and could invite the kinds of rent-seeking and opportunistic pricing <br/>
practices that fall squarely within the definition of information blocking. We clarify that an <br/>
actor’s practices could qualify for both this exception (recovering costs reasonably incurred) and <br/>

 <br/>
the exception for licensing of interoperability elements on reasonable and non-discriminatory <br/>
terms in section VIII.D.6. In that case, the actor could recover costs under both exceptions.  <br/>
Second, and for similar reasons, an actor would not be permitted to recover costs that are <br/>
speculative. The exception would not apply to “opportunity costs,” such as the revenues that an <br/>
actor could have earned had it not provided the interoperability elements. We clarify that the <br/>
exclusion of opportunity costs would not preclude an actor from recovering its reasonable <br/>
forward-looking cost of capital. We believe these costs are relatively concrete and that permitting <br/>
their recovery will protect incentives for actors to invest in developing and providing <br/>
interoperability elements.  <br/>
<i>Fee Prohibited by 45 CFR 164.524(c)(4) </i><br/>
We also propose that the exception would not apply to fees prohibited by 45 CFR <br/>
164.524(c)(4). The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits a covered entity to impose a reasonable, cost-<br/>
based fee if the individual requests a copy of the PHI (or agrees to receive a summary or <br/>
explanation of the information). The fee may include only the cost of: (1) labor for copying the <br/>
PHI requested by the individual, whether in paper or electronic form; (2) supplies for creating the <br/>
paper copy or electronic media (e.g., CD or USB drive) if the individual requests that the <br/>
electronic copy be provided on portable media; (3) postage, when the individual requests that the <br/>
copy, or the summary or explanation, be mailed; and (4) preparation of an explanation or <br/>
summary of the PHI, if agreed to by the individual (45 CFR 164.524(c)(4)). The fee may not <br/>
include costs associated with verification; documentation; searching for and retrieving the PHI; <br/>
maintaining systems; recouping capital for data access, storage, or infrastructure; or other costs <br/>
not listed above even if such costs are authorized by state law. <br/>

 <br/>
<i>Individual Electronic Access </i><br/>
We propose that this exception would not apply if the actor charged a fee based in any <br/>
part on the electronic access by an individual or their personal representative, agent, or designee <br/>
to the individual’s EHI. Such fees are distinguished from the cost-based fees that a covered entity <br/>
is permitted to charge individuals for the provision of copies of ePHI under HIPAA (45 CFR <br/>
164.524(c)(4)), and similar allowable costs under state privacy laws, which would not be <br/>
excluded from the costs recoverable under this exception. To be clear, access to EHI that is <br/>
provisioned by supplying some form of physical media, such as paper copies (where the EHI is <br/>
printed out), or where EHI is copied onto a CD or flash-drive, would not be a practice that <br/>
implicated the information blocking provision provided that the fee(s) charged for that access <br/>
complied with HIPAA (45 CFR 164.524(c)(4)).  <br/>
A fee based on electronic access by an individual or their personal representative, agent, <br/>
or designee to the individual’s EHI, in contrast, would arise if an actor sought to impose on <br/>
individuals, or their personal representatives, agents, or designees, a fee that operated as a toll for <br/>
the provision of electronic access. For example, a health care provider that charges individuals a <br/>
fee in order that the individuals be given access to their EHI via the health care provider’s patient <br/>
portal or another mode of web-based delivery, would not be able to benefit from this exception. <br/>
Similarly, where an individual authorizes a consumer-facing app to retrieve EHI on the <br/>
individual’s behalf, it would be impermissible for an actor to charge the app or its developer a <br/>
fee to access or use APIs that enable access to the individual’s EHI. This would be true whether <br/>
the actor is a supplier of the API technology or an individual or entity that has deployed the API <br/>
technology, such as a health care provider.  <br/>

<i>Export and Portability of EHI Maintained in EHR Systems </i> <br/>
 <br/>
The definition of information blocking specifically mentions transitions between health <br/>
IT systems and the export of complete information sets as protected forms of access, exchange, <br/>
and use (<i>see</i> section 3022(a)(2)(C)(i) of the PHSA). In our experience, health care providers <br/>
frequently encounter rent-seeking and opportunistic pricing practices in these and other contexts <br/>
in which they are attempting to export EHI from their systems for use in connection with other <br/>
technologies or services that compete with or could reduce the revenue opportunities associated <br/>
with an EHR developer’s own suite of products and services. As discussed in section <br/>
VIII.C.5.b.iii of this preamble, most EHI is currently maintained in EHRs and other source <br/>
systems that use proprietary data models or formats; this puts EHR developers in a unique <br/>
position to block the export and portability of EHI for use in competing systems or applications, <br/>
or to charge rents for access to the basic technical information needed to facilitate the conversion <br/>
or migration of data for these purposes. The concerns are compounded by the fact that EHR <br/>
developers rarely disclose in advance the fees they will charge for data export and data <br/>
portability services (<i>see </i>80 FR 62719; 80 FR 16880–81).  <br/>
 <br/>
For the reasons above, we propose that fees charged for the export, conversion, or <br/>
migration of data from an EHR technology would not qualify for the exception unless they also <br/>
meet two additional conditions.  <br/>
First, we propose that health IT developers of certified health IT would, for purposes of <br/>
this exception, be precluded from charging a fee to perform an export of EHI via the capability <br/>
of health IT certified to the proposed 2015 Edition “EHI export” certification criterion (§ <br/>
170.315(b)(10)) for the purposes of switching health IT systems or to provide patients their EHI. <br/>

 <br/>
As part of the “Assurances” Condition of Certification, health IT developers that produce and <br/>
electronically manage EHI would need to be certified to the “EHI export” criterion and provider <br/>
the functionality to its customers (<i>see </i>§ 170.402(a)(4) and section VII.B.2.b of this preamble). <br/>
As described in section IV.C.1 of this preamble, the “EHI export” certification criterion is <br/>
intended to provide a baseline capability to export EHI from certified health IT in a <br/>
commercially reasonable format in support of transitioning of EHI between health IT systems <br/>
and patient access. Fees or limitations associated with the use of this capability (as distinguished <br/>
from deployment or other costs reasonably incurred by the developer) would not receive <br/>
protection under the exception and may be suspect under the information blocking provision. We <br/>
clarify that this condition would not preclude a developer from charging a fee to deploy the EHI <br/>
export capability in a health care provider’s production environment, or to provide additional <br/>
services in connection with this capability other than those reasonably necessary to enable its <br/>
intended use. For example, this condition would not preclude a developer from charging a fee to <br/>
perform an export of EHI via the capability of health IT certified to the proposed § <br/>
170.315(b)(10) for a third-party analytics company. We emphasize once again that these <br/>
excluded fees are distinguished from the cost-based fees that a covered entity is permitted to <br/>
charge individuals for the provision of copies of ePHI under HIPAA (45 CFR 164.524(c)(4)), <br/>
and similar allowable costs under state privacy laws, which would not be excluded from the costs <br/>
recoverable under this exception. <br/>
We note that, because this certification criterion provides only a baseline capability for <br/>
exporting data, we anticipate that health IT developers of certified health IT will need to provide <br/>
other data portability services to facilitate the smooth transition of health care providers between <br/>

different health IT systems. We propose that such fees may qualify for protection under the <br/>
exception, but only if they meet the other conditions described above and in proposed § <br/>
171.205(a).  <br/>
Second, we propose that the exception would not apply to a fee to export or convert data <br/>
from an EHR technology unless such fee was agreed to in writing at the time the technology was <br/>
acquired, meaning when the EHR developer and the customer entered into a contract or license <br/>
agreement for the EHR technology. This condition is designed to promote the disclosure of fees <br/>
upfront and thereby reduce the potential for actors to engage in installed-base opportunism or <br/>
attempting to use fees to discourage data portability.  <br/>
<i>Compliance with the Condition of Certification Specific to API Technology Suppliers and API </i><br/>
<i>Data Providers.</i> <br/>
 <br/>
We note that health IT developers of certified health IT subject to the API Condition of <br/>
Certification proposed in § 170.404 may not charge certain types of fees and are subject to more <br/>
specific cost accountability provisions than apply generally under this proposed exception. We <br/>
believe that the failure of developers to comply with these additional requirements would impose <br/>
impediments to consumer and other stakeholder access to EHI without special effort and would <br/>
be suspect under the information blocking provision. We propose, therefore, that a health IT <br/>
developer of certified health IT subject to the API Condition of Certification must comply with <br/>
all requirements of that condition for all practices and at all relevant times in order to qualify for <br/>
this exception.  <br/>
 <br/>
We also believe that a health care provider that acts as an API Data Provider, should be <br/>
subject to the same constraints. For example, the API Condition of Certification prohibits a <br/>

health IT developer from charging a usage fee to patient-oriented apps. We believe information <br/>
blocking concerns would arise if a provider were to charge such a fee, notwithstanding the fact <br/>
that the provider is not subject to the certification requirements. For this reason, we propose that, <br/>
if the actor is an API Data Provider, the actor is only permitted to charge the same fees that an <br/>
API Technology Supplier is permitted to charge to recover costs consistent with the permitted <br/>
fees specified in the Condition of Certification in § 170.404. In other words, to the extent that a <br/>
provider is an API Data Provider, the provider will not qualify for this exception if it charges any <br/>
fee that a health IT developer of certified health IT would be prohibited from charging under the <br/>
API Condition of Certification.  <br/>
<i>Application of the Exception to Individual Practices  </i><br/>
 <br/>
We clarify that the conditions of this exception, including those governing the <br/>
methodology and criteria by which an actor calculates and distributes its costs, must be satisfied <br/>
for <i>each and every</i> fee that an actor charges to a customer, requestor, or other person. For <br/>
example, if an actor uses a cost allocation methodology that does not meet the requirements of <br/>
the exception, each fee charged on the basis of that methodology would be a suspect practice <br/>
under the information blocking provision. All applicable conditions of the exception must be met <br/>
at all relevant times for each practice.  <br/>
 <br/>
We request comment on this proposed exception. Specifically, we ask commenters to <br/>
consider alternate approaches to the exception that would also achieve the goal of allowing <br/>
actors to recover certain types of costs that would promote innovation, competition and <br/>
consumer welfare and that are unlikely to present information blocking concerns. In assessing <br/>
other potential approaches to this exception, we encourage commenters to contemplate such <br/>

considerations as enforceability, potential burden on the parties, and overall effectiveness in <br/>
meeting the above stated goals.<i> </i><br/>
5. Responding to Requests that are Infeasible <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking provision that would <br/>
permit an actor to decline to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI in a manner that is <br/>
infeasible, provided certain conditions are met. The exception and corresponding conditions are <br/>
set forth in the proposed regulation text in § 171.205. We propose that this exception would not <br/>
apply when a response is required by law. As discussed in section VIII.C.5 of this preamble, we <br/>
propose that the information blocking provision would be implicated if an actor were to refuse to <br/>
facilitate access, exchange, or use of EHI, either as a general practice or in isolated instances. <br/>
However, we believe that in certain circumstances legitimate practical challenges beyond an <br/>
actor’s control may limit its ability to comply with requests for access, exchange, or use. In some <br/>
cases, the actor may not have—and may be unable to obtain—the requisite technological <br/>
capabilities, legal rights, financial resources, or other means necessary to provide a particular <br/>
form of access, exchange, or use. In other cases, the actor may be able to comply with the <br/>
request, but only by incurring costs or other burdens that are clearly unreasonable under the <br/>
circumstances.  <br/>
 <br/>
Actors confronted with these types of practical challenges may be concerned about their <br/>
exposure under the information blocking provision, which could lead to inefficient outcomes. <br/>
For example, health care providers may feel compelled to entertain requests to enable or support <br/>
means of exchange or use that would be disruptive to health care operations or that are not <br/>
financially sustainable. In some of these instances, the actor may be able, but reluctant, to offer <br/>

alternative means that would meet the requestor’s needs while reducing the burden on the actor, <br/>
leading to more efficient outcomes overall. Actors could also be forced into a “reactive” posture <br/>
that limits their ability to make holistic decisions and to implement health IT in a considered, <br/>
scalable way that facilitates robust interoperability and information sharing. These outcomes <br/>
would be counterproductive to the policies the information blocking provision encompasses.    <br/>
 <br/>
The proposed exception would alleviate some of these concerns while safeguarding <br/>
against pretextual and other unreasonable refusals to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI. <br/>
The exception would permit an actor to decline a request in certain narrowly-defined <br/>
circumstances when doing so would be infeasible (or impossible) and when the actor otherwise <br/>
did all that it reasonably could do under the circumstances to facilitate alternative means of <br/>
accessing, exchanging, and using the EHI. We believe this approach is principled and tailored in <br/>
a manner that will promote basic fairness and encourage parties to work cooperatively to <br/>
implement efficient solutions to interoperability challenges. Importantly, to ensure that the <br/>
exception is not used inappropriately, we propose a structured, fact-based approach for <br/>
determining whether a request was in fact “infeasible” within the meaning of this exception. This <br/>
approach would be limited to a consideration of factors specifically delineated in the exception <br/>
and that focus the infeasibility inquiry on the immediate and direct financial and operational <br/>
challenges of facilitating access, exchange, and use, as distinguished from more remote, indirect, <br/>
or speculative types of injuries.  <br/>
 <br/>
We encourage comment on these and other aspects of this proposal, which are described <br/>
in more detail below.  <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
To qualify for this proposed exception, in addition to meeting other conditions, we <br/>
propose that compliance with the request for access, exchange, or use must be infeasible. We <br/>
propose a two-step test that an actor would need to meet in order to demonstrate that a request <br/>
was infeasible.  <br/>
<i>Complying with the request would impose a substantial burden on the actor. </i><br/>
 <br/>
Under the first step of the infeasibility test, the actor would need to show that complying <br/>
with the particular request in the manner requested would impose a substantial burden on the <br/>
actor that is unreasonable under the circumstances. We anticipate that in most cases an actor <br/>
would meet this requirement by showing that it did not have, and could not readily obtain, the <br/>
requisite technological capabilities, legal rights, or other means necessary to facilitate the <br/>
particular type of access, exchange, or use requested. Additionally, the requirement could be met <br/>
by showing that, had it complied with the request, the actor would have experienced a significant <br/>
disruption to its health care or business activities or would have incurred significant unbudgeted <br/>
costs. We would also consider other analogous outcomes that impact the actor’s health care or <br/>
business activities in a direct and substantial way. We seek comment on what those outcomes <br/>
might be and encourage commenters to be as detailed and specific as possible.  <br/>
 <br/>
In determining whether these or other types of burdens are substantial, we would consider <br/>
the actor’s particular circumstances, including the type of actor; the nature and purpose of its <br/>
business or other activities; and the financial, technical, and other resources and expertise at its <br/>
disposal. In addition, we would also consider any offsetting benefits to the actor of providing the <br/>
requested access, exchange, or use, such as facilitating the actor’s compliance with statutory and <br/>

 <br/>
regulatory requirements. Due to the variability of circumstances, ONC would take a fact-specific <br/>
approach to these analyses.  <br/>
As an illustration, a small physician practice with limited financial and technical <br/>
resources may find it burdensome to accommodate requests from other providers to establish and <br/>
maintain outbound interfaces from the practice’s EHR system that it neither needs for its own <br/>
health care activities nor to comply with any regulatory requirements. In contrast, a large health <br/>
system with a well-resourced IT department may be in a position to accommodate such requests <br/>
without significant disruption to its business and at relatively minimal additional expense relative <br/>
to its overall IT budget. Similarly, custom development or other activities that might be <br/>
burdensome for a health care provider with limited technical expertise may not result in a <br/>
substantial burden for a health IT developer, exchange, or network whose business is to develop <br/>
and provide technological solutions.  <br/>
 <br/>
We clarify that the exception focuses solely on the immediate and direct financial and <br/>
operational challenges of facilitating access, exchange, or use. The exception does not apply—<br/>
and we would give no weight—to any putative burdens that an actor experiences that relate <br/>
primarily to the actor’s pursuit of an economic advantage, such as its ability to charge higher <br/>
prices, capture additional revenue streams, maintain or increase its market share, or otherwise <br/>
pursue its own economic interests. To the extent that these interests merit an exception under the <br/>
information blocking provision, they are addressed under the exceptions proposed in §§ 171.204 <br/>
and 171.206. In the same way, the exception would not apply to any putative burdens that are <br/>
more appropriately examined under another proposed exception. For example, an actor could not <br/>
claim that it is burdensome to implement a tailored organizational patient safety policy under <br/>

proposed § 171.201(b) or to develop and implement policies and procedures for satisfying <br/>
preconditions imposed by state or federal privacy laws for the provision of access, exchange, or <br/>
use of EHI under proposed § 171.202(b). <br/>
<i>The burden imposed on the actor would be plainly unreasonable under the circumstances. </i><br/>
 <br/>
To show that a request for access, exchange, or use was infeasible, the actor must not <br/>
only demonstrate that complying with the request would have resulted in a substantial burden, as <br/>
described above; the actor must also demonstrate that requiring it to comply with the request—<br/>
and thus to assume the substantial burden demonstrated under the first part of the test—would <br/>
have been plainly unreasonable under the circumstances. Whether it would have been plainly <br/>
unreasonable for the actor to assume the burden of providing access, exchange, or use will be <br/>
highly dependent on the particular facts and circumstances. While for this reason we do not <br/>
believe that bright-line rules would be appropriate, we do propose to rely primarily on the <br/>
following key factors enumerated in proposed § 171.205(a)(1):   <br/>
•  The type of EHI and the purposes for which it may be needed;  <br/>
•  The cost to the actor of complying with the request in the manner requested; <br/>
•  The financial, technical, and other resources available to the actor;  <br/>
•  Whether the actor provides comparable access, exchange, or use to itself or to its customers, <br/>
suppliers, partners, and other persons with whom it has a business relationship; <br/>
•  Whether the actor owns or has control over a predominant technology, platform, health <br/>
information exchange, or health information network through which EHI is accessed or <br/>
exchanged;  <br/>

 <br/>
•  Whether the actor maintains ePHI on behalf of a covered entity, as defined in 45 CFR <br/>
160.103, or maintains EHI on behalf of the requestor or another person whose access, <br/>
exchange, or use of EHI will be enabled or facilitated by the actor’s compliance with the <br/>
request; <br/>
•  Whether the requestor and other relevant persons can reasonably access, exchange, or use the <br/>
information from other sources or through other means; and <br/>
•  The additional cost and burden to the requestor and other relevant persons of relying on <br/>
alternative means of access, exchange, or use. <br/>
 <br/>
As these factors suggest, the starting point for our inquiry would be to identify the type of <br/>
EHI at issue and the purposes for which it may be needed. As explained in section VIII.C.5.b.i. <br/>
of this preamble, certain types of EHI—namely, observational health information—give rise to a <br/>
heightened risk of interference under the information blocking provision. For purposes of this <br/>
exception and the information blocking provision more generally, the actor has a strong duty to <br/>
facilitate the availability and use of this information, which may be needed for important <br/>
activities for which timely and complete access to EHI is essential, such as providing patients <br/>
with their EHI; enabling the use of EHI for treatment and care coordination; and making EHI <br/>
available for quality improvement and population health management activities.  <br/>
 <br/>
Next, we would consider the severity of the burdens that the actor would have <br/>
experienced to provide the access, exchange, or use of EHI in the manner requested. For this <br/>
purpose, we would consider both the burden on the actor of complying with the specific request <br/>
at issue as well as the burden the actor would experience if it was required to comply with <br/>
similar types of requests. We would also consider the observed or likely frequency of such <br/>

 <br/>
requests. As already discussed, we anticipate that the extent of any burden would depend in part <br/>
on the particular circumstances of the actor. In addition, in considering the burden to the actor, <br/>
we would also consider any offsetting benefits to the actor of providing the requested access, <br/>
exchange, or use. <br/>
 <br/>
Having ascertained the nature and severity of any burdens that the actor would assume to <br/>
provide the requested access, exchange, or use, we would balance these burdens against the <br/>
countervailing costs to the requestor and other persons (including consumers) who would be <br/>
harmed by the actor’s refusal to provide the requested access, exchange, or use. Importantly, we <br/>
would consider whether the requestor and other persons could have obtained the EHI from other <br/>
sources or through other means, including those made available by the actor as an <br/>
accommodation to the requestor, as discussed in more detail below. If alternative means were <br/>
available, we would examine the extent to which they would have been appropriate for the <br/>
purposes for which the EHI or interoperability elements were needed and the extent to which <br/>
requiring the requestor to pursue these alternative means would impose additional costs or <br/>
burdens on the requestor and other persons. For example, if the EHI was readily available <br/>
through other means that were equally efficacious, the actor’s refusal to provide yet one more <br/>
means of access, exchange, or use might impose only a minimal burden on the requestor and <br/>
other persons’ use of the EHI. In contrast, if the actor conditions critical technology or <br/>
infrastructure for accessing, exchanging, or using EHI, or if its control over other interoperability <br/>
elements means that EHI cannot be efficiently accessed, exchanged, or used without the actor’s <br/>
cooperation, requiring the requestor to pursue other means of access, exchange, or use would <br/>
likely be unrealistic and represent an insurmountable burden.  <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
One final consideration would inform our analysis. We would consider the balancing of <br/>
relative burdens in conjunction with the actor’s control over interoperability elements. As an <br/>
example, a dominant health IT developer of certified health IT or network that refuses to <br/>
facilitate a particular form of access, exchange, or use with other entities would have to <br/>
demonstrate an extreme burden relative to the need for access, exchange, or use in order to <br/>
qualify for this exception. This exacting standard would also apply in other circumstances of <br/>
dependence or reliance on the actor to facilitate access, exchange, or use. For example, a <br/>
dominant health system that provides local health IT infrastructure would have to demonstrate an <br/>
extreme hardship to justify denying interconnection requests or access to interoperability <br/>
elements. Likewise, where the actor is a business associate of a covered entity, or owes some <br/>
other special duty to the requestor, the actor could not qualify for this exception unless the cost <br/>
or burden it would have borne was so extreme in comparison to the marginal benefits to the <br/>
requestor that the request was clearly unreasonable by any objective measure.  <br/>
We acknowledge that there may be situations when complying with a request for access, <br/>
exchange, or use would be considered infeasible because an actor is unable to provide such <br/>
access, exchange, or use due to unforeseeable or unavoidable circumstances that are outside the <br/>
actor’s control. For example, an actor could seek coverage under this exception if it is unable to <br/>
provide access, exchange, or use of EHI due to a natural disaster (such as a hurricane, tornado or <br/>
earthquake) or war. These are just a couple examples of such circumstances and are by no means <br/>
an exhaustive list. <br/>
We emphasize that, consistent with the requirements for demonstrating that activities and <br/>
practices meet the conditions of an exception proposed in section VIII.C.6.c of this preamble, the <br/>

actor would need to produce evidence and ultimately prove that complying with the request for <br/>
access, exchange, or use in the manner requested would have imposed a clearly unreasonable <br/>
burden on the actor under the circumstances.  <br/>
We note that there are certain circumstances that we propose would not constitute a <br/>
burden to the actor for purposes of this exception and shall not be considered in determining <br/>
whether complying with a request would have been infeasible. We propose that it would not be <br/>
considered a burden if providing the requested access, exchange, or use in the manner requested <br/>
would have (1) facilitated competition with the actor; or (2) prevented the actor from charging a <br/>
fee. Throughout this proposed rule, we have highlighted that one of the goals of the information <br/>
blocking section is to promote competition, and allowing the argument that a request is infeasible <br/>
because it facilitates competition with the actor would be antithetical to this goal. Similarly, an <br/>
argument that a request is infeasible because it prevents the actor from charging a fee would also <br/>
be outside the scope of this exception because such a result would not constitute a substantial, <br/>
unreasonable burden that this exception seeks to address. <br/>
 <br/>
We request comment on the structured, fact-based approach we have proposed for <br/>
determining whether a request was in fact “infeasible” within the meaning of this exception. We <br/>
encourage comment on, among other issues, whether the factors we have specifically delineated <br/>
above properly focus the infeasibility inquiry; whether our approach to weighing these factors is <br/>
appropriate; and whether there are additional burdens, distinct from the immediate and direct <br/>
financial and operational challenges contemplated above, that are similarly concrete and should <br/>
be considered under the fact-based rubric of this exception.  <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
In addition to demonstrating that a particular request or class of requests was infeasible, <br/>
we propose that an actor would have to show that it satisfied several additional conditions. <br/>
Specifically, to qualify for this exception, the actor must have timely responded to all requests <br/>
relating to access, exchange, and use of EHI, including but not limited to requests to establish <br/>
connections and to provide interoperability elements. Further, for any request that the actor <br/>
claims was infeasible, the actor must have provided the requestor with a detailed written <br/>
explanation of the reasons why the actor could not accommodate the request. Finally, the actor <br/>
must have worked with the requesting party in a timely manner to identify and provide a <br/>
reasonable alternative means of accessing, exchanging, or using the EHI, as applicable. The <br/>
actor’s failure to meet any of these conditions would disqualify the actor from the exception and <br/>
could also be evidence that the actor knew that it was engaging in practices that contravened the <br/>
information blocking provision.  <br/>
 <br/>
We clarify that the duty to timely respond and provide reasonable cooperation would <br/>
necessarily be assessed from the standpoint of what is objectively reasonable for an individual or <br/>
entity in the actor’s position. For example, we would not expect a small physician practice to <br/>
provide the same level of engagement and technical assistance to third parties as a large hospital <br/>
or health system with considerable health IT resources and expertise at its disposal. In some <br/>
circumstances, it may even be difficult for a small practice to comply with any request for <br/>
access, exchange, and use that is more complicated than a simple request for a patient’s personal <br/>
health information. If there are such requests – and there could be – then small practices may be <br/>
both unable to comply with such requests and poorly situated to assist requesting parties with <br/>

alternatives. We provide these examples to emphasize that we will look at the specific facts and <br/>
circumstances of each case to determine what is objectively reasonable. <br/>
 <br/>
We believe that these conditions will minimize the risk that this exception could protect <br/>
improper refusals to provide interoperability elements, including naked refusals to deal as well as <br/>
other practices, such as improper delays in access or exchange that would present information <br/>
blocking concerns. Additionally, the requirements for an actor to timely respond and document <br/>
its justifications for declining a request in writing would prevent an actor from using post hoc <br/>
rationalizations to justify these and other improper practices. Finally, we believe that establishing <br/>
a clear duty under the exception for actors to deal on reasonable terms with parties seeking to <br/>
access, exchange, or use EHI will encourage parties to cooperate to identify and implement <br/>
efficient solutions to interoperability challenges, thereby avoiding disputes that could lead to <br/>
information blocking.  <br/>
 <br/>
We encourage comment on the additional conditions and related considerations described <br/>
above. Specifically, we request comment regarding potential obstacles to satisfying these <br/>
conditions and improvements we could make to the proposed process.  <br/>
6. Licensing of Interoperability Elements on Reasonable and Non-discriminatory Terms <br/>
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking provision that would <br/>
permit actors to license interoperability elements on reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) <br/>
terms, provided that certain conditions are met. The exception and corresponding conditions are <br/>
set forth in the proposed regulation text in § 171.206. As discussed in section VIII.C.5.a of this <br/>
preamble, the information blocking provision would be implicated if an actor were to refuse to <br/>
license or allow the disclosure of interoperability elements to persons who require those elements <br/>

 <br/>
to develop and provide interoperable technologies or services—including those that might <br/>
complement or compete with the actor’s own technology or services. Moreover, the information <br/>
blocking provision would be implicated if the actor licensed such interoperability elements <br/>
subject to terms or conditions that have the purpose or effect of excluding or discouraging <br/>
competitors, rivals, or other persons from engaging in these pro-competitive and interoperability-<br/>
enhancing activities. Thus, this licensing requirement would apply in both vertical and horizontal <br/>
relationships. For instance, it would apply when a developer in a vertical relationship to the <br/>
actor—a network in this example—wants to use interoperability elements in order to access the <br/>
EHI maintained in the actor’s network. The requirement would also apply when a rival network <br/>
in a horizontal relationship to the actor (network) wants to use interoperability elements so that <br/>
its network can be compatible with the applications that have already been developed for use <br/>
with the actor’s network. <br/>
We note that some licensees do not require the interoperability elements to develop <br/>
products or services that can be interoperable with the actor’s health IT. For instance, there may <br/>
be firms that simply want to license the actor’s technology for use in developing their own <br/>
interoperability elements. Their interest would be for access to the technology itself – not for the <br/>
use of the technology to interoperate with either the actor or its customers. This may be the case, <br/>
for example, if the relevant intellectual property included patents that were applicable to other <br/>
information technology applications outside of health IT. In such cases, the actor’s licensing of <br/>
its patents in such a context would <i>not</i> implicate the information blocking provision. <br/>
Below are examples of situations that <i>would implicate</i> the information blocking provision <br/>
(these examples are not exhaustive): <br/>

•  An actor refuses to negotiate a license after receiving a request from a developer. <br/>
•  An actor offers a license at the request of a developer, but only at a royalty rate that exceeds a <br/>
RAND rate. <br/>
•  An actor offers a license to a competitor at a royalty rate significantly higher than was <br/>
offered to a party not in direct competition with the actor. <br/>
•  An actor files a patent infringement lawsuit against a developer without first offering to <br/>
negotiate a license on RAND terms. <br/>
There are compelling reasons for this prohibition. In our experience, contractual and <br/>
intellectual property rights are frequently used to extract rents for access to EHI or to prevent <br/>
competition from developers of interoperable technologies and services (<i>see</i> section <br/>
VIII.C.5.c.iv. of this preamble). These practices frustrate access, exchange, and use of EHI and <br/>
stifle competition and innovation in the health IT sector. As a case in point, even following the <br/>
enactment of the Cures Act, some EHR developers are selectively prohibiting—whether <br/>
expressly or through commercially unreasonable terms—the disclosure or use of technical <br/>
interoperability information required for third-party applications to be able to access, exchange, <br/>
and use EHI maintained in EHR systems. This limits health care providers’ use of the EHI <br/>
maintained on their behalf to the particular capabilities and use cases that their EHR developer <br/>
happens to support. More than this, by limiting the ability of providers to choose what <br/>
applications and technologies they can use with their EHR systems, these practices close off the <br/>
market to innovative applications and services that providers and other stakeholders need to <br/>
deliver greater value and choice to health care purchasers and consumers.  <br/>

 <br/>
Despite these serious concerns, we recognize that the definition of information blocking <br/>
may be broader than necessary and could have unintended consequences. In contrast to the <br/>
practices described above, we believe it is generally appropriate for actors to license their <br/>
intellectual property (IP) on RAND terms that do not block interoperability. Provided certain <br/>
conditions are met, we believe that these practices would further the goals of the information <br/>
blocking provision by allowing actors to protect the value of their innovations and earn returns <br/>
on the investments they have made to develop, maintain, and update those innovations. This in <br/>
turn will protect future incentives to invest in, develop, and disseminate interoperable <br/>
technologies and services. Conversely, if actors cannot (or believe they cannot) protect and <br/>
commercialize their innovations, they may not engage in these productive activities that improve <br/>
access, exchange, and use of EHI.  <br/>
 <br/>
While we believe this exception is necessary to promote competition and consumer <br/>
welfare, we are highly sensitive to the danger that actors will continue to use their contractual <br/>
and IP rights to interfere with access, exchange, and use of EHI, undermining the information <br/>
blocking provision’s fundamental objectives. For this reason, the exception would be subject to <br/>
strict conditions to ensure, among other things, that actors license interoperability elements on <br/>
RAND terms and that they do not impose collateral terms or engage in other practices that would <br/>
impede the use of the interoperability elements or otherwise undermine the intent of this <br/>
exception.  <br/>
We acknowledge that preventing intellectual property holders from extracting rents for <br/>
access to EHI may differ from standard intellectual property policy. Absent specific <br/>
circumstances, IP holders are generally free to negotiate with prospective licensees to determine <br/>

 <br/>
the royalty to practice their IP, and this negotiated royalty frequently reflects the value the <br/>
licensee would obtain from exercising those rights. However, in the context of EHI, we propose <br/>
that a limitation on rents is essential due to the likelihood that rents will frustrate access, <br/>
exchange, and use of EHI, particularly because of the power dynamics that exist in the health IT <br/>
market. <br/>
 <br/>
We remind readers that actors are not required to seek the protection of this (or any other) <br/>
exception. If an actor does not want to license a particular technology, it may choose to comply <br/>
with the information blocking provision in another way, such as by developing and providing <br/>
alternative means of accessing, exchanging, and using EHI that are similarly efficient and <br/>
efficacious. The purpose of this exception is not to dictate a licensing scheme for all, or even <br/>
most, health IT, but rather to provide a tailored “safe harbor” that will provide clear expectations <br/>
for those who desire it.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
i. Reasonable and Non-discriminatory (RAND) Terms  <br/>
 <br/>
We propose to require, as a condition of this exception, that any terms upon which an <br/>
actor licenses interoperability elements must be reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND). As <br/>
discussed below, commitments to license technology on RAND terms are frequently required in <br/>
the context of standards development organizations (SDOs), and we believe that the practical and <br/>
policy considerations that have led SDOs to adopt these policies are related in many respects to <br/>
the information blocking concerns presented when an actor exploits control over interoperability <br/>
elements to extract economic rents or impede the development or use of interoperable <br/>
technologies and services.  <br/>

We recognize that strong legal protections for IP rights can promote competition and <br/>
innovation.<a href="ONCs.html#472">125 </a>Nevertheless, IP rights can also be misused in ways that undermine these goals.<a href="ONCs.html#472">126</a> <br/>
We believe this potential for abuse is heightened when the IP rights pertain to functional aspects <br/>
of technology that are essential to enabling interoperability. As an important example, a <br/>
technology developer may encourage the inclusion of its technology in an industry standard <br/>
created by an SDO while not disclosing that it has IP rights in that technology. After the SDO <br/>
incorporates the technology into its standard, and industry begins to make investments tied to the <br/>
standard, the IP-holder may then assert its IP rights and demand royalties or license terms that it <br/>
could not have achieved before the standard was adopted because companies would incur <br/>
substantial switching costs to abandon initial designs or adopt different products.<a href="ONCs.html#472">127 </a>To address <br/>
these types of concerns, while balancing the legitimate interests and incentives of IP owners, <br/>
many SDOs now have policies requiring members who contribute technologies to a standard to <br/>
voluntarily commit to license that technology on RAND terms and will consider whether firms <br/>
have made voluntary RAND commitments when weighing whether to include their technology <br/>
in standards.<a href="ONCs.html#472">128</a> While this commitment to license on RAND terms is voluntary as compared to <br/>

 <br/>
our proposed requirement to use RAND terms, it serves to illustrate how RAND terms can be <br/>
used to address such concerns.  <br/>
 <br/>
Similar concerns arise when actors who control proprietary interoperability elements <br/>
demand royalties or license terms from competitors or other persons who are technologically <br/>
dependent on the use of those interoperability elements. As discussed in section VIII.C.5 of this <br/>
preamble, to the extent that the interoperability elements are essential to enable the efficient <br/>
access, exchange, or use of EHI by particular persons or for particular purposes, any practice by <br/>
the actor that could impede the use of the interoperability elements for that purpose—or that <br/>
could unnecessarily increase the cost or other burden of using the elements for that purpose—<br/>
would give rise to an obvious risk of interference with access, exchange, or use of EHI under the <br/>
information blocking provision.  <br/>
 <br/>
We believe that a RAND requirement would balance the need for robust IP protections <br/>
with the need to ensure that this proposed exception does not permit actors to exercise their IP or <br/>
other proprietary rights in inappropriate ways that block the development, adoption, or use of <br/>
interoperable technologies and services. The exercise of IP rights in these ways is incompatible <br/>
with the information blocking provision, which protects the investments that taxpayers and the <br/>
health care industry have made to adopt technologies that will enable the efficient sharing of EHI <br/>
to benefit consumers and the health care system. While actors are entitled to protect and exercise <br/>
their IP rights, to benefit from this exception to the information blocking provision they must do <br/>
so in a reasonable and non-discriminatory manner that does not undermine these efforts and <br/>
impede the appropriate flow of EHI.  <br/>

 <br/>
Accordingly, we propose that, to qualify for this exception, an actor must license <br/>
requested interoperability elements on RAND terms. To comply with this condition, any terms or <br/>
conditions under which the actor discloses or allows the use of interoperability elements must <br/>
meet several requirements set forth below. These requirements apply to both price terms (such as <br/>
royalties and license fees) and other terms, such as conditions or limitations on access to <br/>
interoperability elements or the purposes for which they can be used.  <br/>
<i>Responding to requests. </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose that, upon receiving a request to license or use interoperability elements, an <br/>
actor would be required to respond to the requestor within 10 business days from receipt of the <br/>
request. We note that the request could be made to “license” or “use” the interoperability <br/>
elements because a requestor may not always know that “license” is the legal mechanism for <br/>
“use” when making the request. This provision is intended to ensure that a requestor is given an <br/>
opportunity to license <i>and </i>use interoperability elements. As such, the requirement for responding <br/>
to requests should not be limited to requests to “license.”  <br/>
In order to meet this requirement, the actor would be required to respond to the requestor <br/>
within 10 business days from the receipt of the request by: (1) negotiating with the requestor in a <br/>
RAND fashion to identify the interoperability elements that are needed; and (2) offering an <br/>
appropriate license with RAND terms, consistent with its other obligations under this exception. <br/>
We emphasize that, in order to qualify for this proposed exception, the actor is only required to <br/>
<i>negotiate</i> with the requestor in a RAND fashion and to <i>offer</i> a license with RAND terms. The <br/>
actor is not required to <i>grant</i> a license in all instances. For example, the actor would not be <br/>

 <br/>
required to grant a license if the requestor refuses an actor’s offer to license interoperability <br/>
elements on RAND terms.   <br/>
We emphasize that there would be circumstances under which the actor could pursue <br/>
legal action against parties that infringe its intellectual property whilst complying with this <br/>
exception. For instance, an actor could bring legal action if a firm appropriates the actor’s <br/>
intellectual property without requesting a license or after refusing to accept a license on RAND <br/>
terms. <br/>
We do not propose a set timeframe for when the negotiations must be resolved because it <br/>
is difficult to predict the duration of such negotiations. For instance, there could be situations <br/>
when the actor and requestor meet once and the actor makes a RAND offer that is immediately <br/>
accepted by the requestor. However, there could be other situations when the requestor and actor <br/>
each make counteroffers, which would extend the negotiations.  <br/>
We request comment on whether 10 business days is an appropriate amount of time for <br/>
the actor to respond to the requestor. In proposing this timeframe, we considered the urgency of <br/>
certain requests to license interoperability elements and our expectation that developers would <br/>
have standard licenses at their disposal that could be adapted in these situations. We considered <br/>
proposing response timeframes ranging from 5 business days to 15 business days. We also <br/>
considered proposing two separate timeframes for: (1) negotiating with the requestor; and (2) <br/>
offering the license. If commenters prefer a different response timeframe or approach than <br/>
proposed, we request that commenters explain their rationale with as much detail as possible.  <br/>
In addition, we query whether we should create set limits for: (1) the amount of time the <br/>
requestor has to accept the actor’s initial offer or make a counteroffer; (2) if the requestor makes <br/>

<i>Scope of rights. </i><br/>
To qualify for this proposed exception, we propose that the actor must license the <br/>
requested interoperability elements with all rights necessary to access and use the interoperability <br/>
elements for the following purposes, as applicable: <br/>
•  All rights necessary to access and use the interoperability elements for the purpose of <br/>
developing products or services that are interoperable with the actor’s health IT or with <br/>
health IT under the actor’s control and/or any third party who currently uses the actor’s <br/>
interoperability elements to interoperate with the actor’s health IT or health IT under the <br/>
actor’s control. These rights would include the right to incorporate and use the <br/>
interoperability elements in the licensee’s own technology to the extent necessary to <br/>
accomplish this purpose. <br/>
•  All rights necessary to market, offer, and distribute the interoperable products and services <br/>
described above to potential customers and users, including the right to copy or disclose the <br/>
interoperability elements as necessary to accomplish this purpose. <br/>
•  All rights necessary to enable the use of the interoperable products or services in production <br/>
environments, including using the interoperability elements to access and enable the <br/>
exchange and use of electronic health information.   <br/>

We request comment on whether these rights are sufficiently inclusive to support <br/>
licensees in developing interoperable technologies, bringing them to market, and deploying them <br/>
for use in production environments. We also request comment on the breadth of these required <br/>

<i>Reasonable royalty. </i><br/>
 <br/>
As a condition of this exception, we propose that if an actor charges a royalty for the use <br/>
of interoperability elements, the royalty base and rate must be reasonable. Consistent with the <br/>
requirements for demonstrating that activities and practices meet the conditions of an exception <br/>
proposed in section VIII.C.6.c, the actor would need to show that the royalty base was <br/>
reasonable and that the royalty was within a reasonable range for the interoperability elements at <br/>
issue. Importantly, we note that the reasonableness of any royalties would be assessed solely on <br/>
basis of the independent value of the actor’s technology to the licensee’s product,<a href="ONCs.html#477">129</a> <i>not </i>on any <br/>
strategic value stemming from the actor’s control over essential means of accessing, exchanging, <br/>
or using electronic health information. For instance, the reasonableness of royalties could not be <br/>
assessed based on the strategic value stemming from the adoption of the technology by <br/>
customers or users, the switching costs associated with the technology, or other circumstances of <br/>
technological dependence described elsewhere in this preamble (see section VIII.C.5). We note <br/>
that “strategic value” would stem from the actor’s control over essential means of accessing, <br/>
exchanging, or using electronic health information. Limiting a reasonable royalty to the value of <br/>
the technology isolated from strategic value is similar in concept to apportionment of reasonable <br/>
royalties for the infringement of standard essential patents (SEPs).<a href="ONCs.html#477">130 </a>In our context, permitting <br/>
an actor to charge a royalty on the basis of these considerations would effectively allow the actor <br/>

to extract rents on access, exchange, and use of EHI, which is contrary to the goals of the <br/>
information blocking provision.  <br/>
 <br/>
In evaluating the actor’s assertions and evidence that the royalty was reasonable, we <br/>
propose that ONC may consider the following factors:  <br/>
•  The royalties received by the actor for the licensing of the proprietary elements in other <br/>
circumstances comparable to RAND-licensing circumstances.  <br/>
•  The rates paid by the licensee for the use of other comparable proprietary elements.  <br/>
•  The nature and scope of the license. <br/>
•  The effect of the proprietary elements in promoting sales of other products of the licensee <br/>
and the licensor, taking into account only the contribution of the elements themselves and not <br/>
of the enhanced interoperability that they enable.  <br/>
•  The utility and advantages of the actor’s interoperability element over the existing <br/>
technology, if any, that had been used to achieve a similar level of access, exchange, or use <br/>
of EHI. <br/>
•  The contribution of the elements to the technical capabilities of the licensee’s products, <br/>
taking into account only the value of the elements themselves and not the enhanced <br/>
interoperability that they enable.  <br/>
•  The portion of the profit or of the selling price that may be customary in the particular <br/>
business or in comparable businesses to allow for the use of the proprietary elements or <br/>
analogous elements that are also covered by RAND commitments.  <br/>
•  The portion of the realizable profit that should be credited to the proprietary elements as <br/>
distinguished from non-proprietary elements, the manufacturing process, business risks, <br/>

significant features or improvements added by the licensee, or the strategic value resulting <br/>
from the network effects, switching costs, or other effects of the adoption of the actor’s <br/>
technology. <br/>
•  The opinion testimony of qualified experts.  <br/>
•  The amount that a licensor and a licensee would have agreed upon (at the time the licensee <br/>
began using the elements) if both were considering the RAND obligation under this <br/>
exception and its purposes, and had been reasonably and voluntarily trying to reach an <br/>
agreement. <br/>
 <br/>
These factors mirror those used by courts that have examined the reasonableness of <br/>
royalties charged pursuant to a commitment to an SDO to license standard-essential technologies <br/>
on RAND terms (<i>see Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola, Inc.</i>;<a href="ONCs.html#479">131</a> In re <i>Innovatio IP Ventures, LLC </i><br/>
<i>Patent Litig.</i>;<a href="ONCs.html#479">132</a> and <i>Realtek Semiconductor Corp. v. LSI Corp</i><a href="ONCs.html#479">133)</a>. However, we have adapted <br/>
the factors to the information blocking context as follows. In the SDO context, the RAND <br/>
requirement mitigates the risk that patent-holders will engage in “hold up”—that is, charging <br/>
excessive royalties that do not reflect the value of their contributions to the standard, but rather <br/>
reflect the costs associated with switching to alternative technologies after a standard is adopted <br/>
—and that the cumulative effect of such royalties will make the standard too expensive to <br/>
implement—a problem called “royalty stacking.”<a href="ONCs.html#479">134 </a>To address the risks of hold-up and royalty <br/>
stacking in the standards development context, a RAND license should compensate a patentee <br/>

 <br/>
for their technical contribution to the technology embodied in a standard, but should not <br/>
compensate them for mere inclusion in the standard.  <br/>
 <br/>
Similarly, in the context of information blocking, we propose the RAND inquiry focuses <br/>
on whether the royalty demanded by the actor represents the independent value of the actor’s <br/>
proprietary technology. We propose that if the actor has licensed the interoperability element <br/>
through a standards development organization in accordance with such organization’s policies <br/>
regarding the licensing of standards-essential technologies on reasonable and non-discriminatory <br/>
terms, the actor may charge a royalty that is consistent with such policies. Rather than asking <br/>
whether the royalty inappropriately captures additional value derived from the technology’s <br/>
inclusion in the industry standard, we would ask whether the actor is charging a royalty that is <br/>
not based on the value of its technology (embodied in the interoperability elements) but rather <br/>
includes the strategic value stemming from the adoption of that technology by customers or <br/>
users. Thus, under this proposed approach and the factors set forth above, we would consider the <br/>
technical contribution of the actor’s interoperability elements to the licensee’s products—such as <br/>
any proprietary capabilities or features that the licensee uses in its product—but would screen out <br/>
any functional aspects of the actor’s technology that are used only to establish interoperability <br/>
and enable EHI to be accessed, exchanged, and used. Additionally, we propose that to address <br/>
the potential risk of royalty stacking we would need to consider the aggregate royalties that <br/>
would apply if owners of other essential interoperability elements made royalty demands of the <br/>
implementer. Specifically, we propose that, to qualify for this exception, the actor must grant <br/>
licenses on terms that are objectively commercially reasonable taking into account the overall <br/>
licensing situation, including the cost to the licensee of obtaining other interoperability elements <br/>

that are important for the viability of the products for which it is seeking to license <br/>
interoperability elements from the actor.   <br/>
 <br/>
We clarify that, as proposed, this condition would not preclude an actor from licensing its <br/>
interoperability elements pursuant to an existing RAND commitment to an SDO. We also note <br/>
that, in addition to complying with the requirements described above, to meet this proposed <br/>
condition any royalties charged must meet the condition, proposed separately below, that any <br/>
license terms be non-discriminatory.  <br/>
 <br/>
We request comment on these aspects of the proposed exception. Commenters are <br/>
encouraged to consider, in particular, whether the factors and approach we have described will <br/>
be administrable and appropriately balance the unreasonable blocking by actors of the use of <br/>
essential interoperability elements with the need to provide adequate assurance to investors and <br/>
innovators that they will be able to earn a reasonable return on their investments in interoperable <br/>
technologies. If our proposed approach does not adequately balance these concerns or would not <br/>
achieve our stated policy goals, we ask that commenters suggest revisions or alternative <br/>
approaches. We ask that such comments be as detailed as possible and provide rigorous <br/>
economic justifications for any suggested revisions or alternative approaches.  <br/>
<i>Non-discriminatory terms. </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose that for this exception to apply the terms on which an actor licenses and <br/>
otherwise provides interoperability elements must be non-discriminatory. This requirement <br/>
would apply to both price and non-price terms, and thus would apply to the royalty terms <br/>
discussed immediately above as well as other types of terms that may be included in licensing <br/>
agreements or other agreements related to the provision or use of interoperability elements. <br/>

 <br/>
To comply with this condition, the terms on which the actor licensed the interoperability <br/>
elements must be based on criteria that the actor applied uniformly for all substantially similar or <br/>
similarly situated classes of persons and requests. This requirement addresses a root cause of <br/>
information blocking<i>.</i> In order to be considered non-discriminatory, such criteria would have to <br/>
be objective and verifiable, not based on the actor’s subjective judgment or discretion. We <br/>
emphasize that this proposal does not mean that the actor must apply the same terms for all <br/>
persons or classes of persons requesting a license. However, any differences in terms would have <br/>
to be based on actual differences in the costs that the actor incurred or other reasonable and non-<br/>
discriminatory criteria. Moreover, we propose that any criteria upon which an actor varies its <br/>
terms or conditions would have to be both competitively neutral—meaning that the criteria are <br/>
not based in any part on whether the requestor or other person is a competitor, potential <br/>
competitor, or will be using EHI obtained via the interoperability elements in a way that <br/>
facilitates competition with the actor—and neutral as to the revenue or other value that the <br/>
requestor may be derived from access, exchange, or use of the EHI obtained via the <br/>
interoperability elements, including any secondary use of such EHI. We believe these limitations <br/>
are necessary in light of the potential for actors to use their control over interoperability elements <br/>
to engage in discriminatory practices that create unreasonable barriers or costs for persons <br/>
seeking to develop, offer, or use interoperable technologies to expand access and enhance the <br/>
exchange and use of EHI.  <br/>
 <br/>
To clarify our expectations for this proposed condition, we provide the following <br/>
illustration. Consider an EHR developer that establishes an “app store” through which third-party <br/>
developers can license the EHR developer’s proprietary APIs, which we assume are separate <br/>

from the APIs required by the API Condition of Certification proposed in § 170.404. The EHR <br/>
developer could charge a reasonable royalty and impose other reasonable terms to license these <br/>
interoperability elements. The terms and conditions could vary based on neutral, objectively <br/>
verifiable, and uniformly applied criteria. These might include, for example, significantly greater <br/>
resources consumed by certain types of apps, such as those that export large volumes of data on a <br/>
continuous basis, or the heightened risks associated with apps designed to “write” data to the <br/>
EHR database or to run natively within the EHR’s user interface. In contrast, the EHR developer <br/>
could <i>not </i>vary its terms and conditions based on subjective criteria, such as whether it thinks an <br/>
app will be “popular” or is a “good fit” for its ecosystem. Nor could it offer different terms or <br/>
conditions on the basis of objective criteria that are not competitively neutral, such as whether an <br/>
app “connects to” other technologies or services, provides capabilities that the EHR developer <br/>
plans to incorporate in a future release of its technology, or enables an efficient means for <br/>
customers to export data for use in other databases or technologies that compete directly with the <br/>
EHR developer. Similarly, the EHR developer could not set different terms or conditions based <br/>
on how much revenue or other value the app might generate from the information it collects <br/>
through the APIs, such as by introducing a revenue-sharing requirement for apps that use data for <br/>
secondary purposes that are very lucrative and for which the EHR developer would like a “piece <br/>
of the pie.” Such practices would disqualify the actor from this exception and would implicate <br/>
the information blocking provision.  <br/>
 <br/>
The foregoing conditions are not intended to limit an actor’s flexibility to set different <br/>
terms based on legitimate differences in the costs to different classes of persons or in response to <br/>
different classes of requests, so long as any such classification was in fact based on neutral <br/>

criteria (in the sense described above) that are objectively verifiable and were applied in a <br/>
consistent manner for persons and/or requests within each class. As an important example, the <br/>
proposed condition would not preclude a covered actor from pursuing strategic partnerships, <br/>
joint ventures, co-marketing agreements, cross-licensing agreements, and other similar types of <br/>
commercial arrangements under which it provides more favorable terms than for other persons <br/>
with whom it has a more arms-length relationship. In these instances the actor should have no <br/>
difficulty identifying substantial and verifiable efficiencies that demonstrate that any variations <br/>
in its terms and conditions were based on objective and neutral criteria. We do note an important <br/>
caveat, however, specifically that a health IT developer of certified health IT who is an “API <br/>
Technology Supplier” under the Condition of Certification proposed in § 170.404 would not be <br/>
permitted to offer different terms in connection with the APIs required by that Condition of <br/>
Certification. As discussed in section VII.B.4 of this preamble, we propose that API Technology <br/>
Suppliers are required to make these APIs available on terms that are no less favorable than <br/>
provided to their own customers, suppliers, partners, and other persons with whom they have a <br/>
business relationship. As noted below towards the end of our discussion of this exception to the <br/>
information blocking provision, the exception incorporates the API Condition of Certification’s <br/>
requirements in full for all health IT developers subject to that condition.  <br/>

We welcome comments on the foregoing condition and requirements.  <br/>

interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. We propose that any attempt to <i>require</i> a licensee <br/>
or its agents or contractors to do or agree to do any of the following would disqualify the actor <br/>
from this exception and would be suspect under the information blocking provision.  <br/>
 <br/>
First, the actor must not require the licensee or its agents or contractors to not compete <br/>
with the actor in any product, service, or market, including markets for goods and services, <br/>
technologies, and research and development. We are aware that such agreements have been used <br/>
to either directly exclude suppliers of interoperable technologies and services from the market or <br/>
to create exclusivity that reduces the range of technologies and options available to health care <br/>
providers and other health IT customers and users.    <br/>
Second, and for similar reasons, the actor must not require the licensee or its agents or <br/>
contractors to deal exclusively with the actor in any product, service, or market, including <br/>
markets for goods and services, technologies, and research and development.  <br/>
Third, the actor must not require the licensee or its agents or contractors to obtain <br/>
additional licenses, products, or services that are not related to or can be unbundled from the <br/>
requested interoperability elements. This condition reinforces the condition described earlier <br/>
requiring that any royalties charged by the actor for the use of interoperability elements be <br/>
reasonable. Without this condition, we believe that an actor could require a licensee to take a <br/>
license to additional interoperability elements that the licensee does not need or want, which <br/>
could enable the actor to extract royalties that are inconsistent with its RAND obligations under <br/>
this exception. We clarify that this condition would not preclude an actor and a willing licensee <br/>
from agreeing to such an arrangement, so long as the arrangement was not <i>required</i>. <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Fourth, the actor must not condition the use of interoperability elements on a requirement <br/>
or agreement to license, grant, assign, or transfer the licensee’s own IP to the actor. We believe it <br/>
is inconsistent with the actor’s RAND licensing obligations under this exception, and would raise <br/>
information blocking concerns, for an actor to use its control over interoperability elements as <br/>
leverage to obtain a “grant back” of IP rights or other consideration whose value may exceed that <br/>
of a reasonable royalty. Consistent with our approach under other conditions of this exception, <br/>
this condition would not preclude an actor and a willing licensee from agreeing to a cross-<br/>
licensing, co-marketing, or other agreement if they so choose. However, the actor cannot <i>require</i> <br/>
the licensee to enter into such an agreement. The actor must offer the option of licensing the <br/>
interoperability elements without a promise to provide consideration beyond a reasonable <br/>
royalty. We note that in the SDO context, it can sometimes be consistent with RAND terms to <br/>
require that an SEP licensee also grant a cross-license to any SEPs that it holds, provided that the <br/>
cross-license is limited to patents essential to the licensed standard. In this way, this condition <br/>
differs from licensing in the SDO context. <br/>
 <br/>
Finally, the actor must not condition the use of interoperability elements on a requirement <br/>
or agreement to pay a fee of any kind whatsoever unless the fee meets either the narrowly crafted <br/>
condition to this exception for a reasonable royalty, or, alternatively, the fee satisfies the separate <br/>
exception proposed in § 171.204, which permits the recovery of certain costs reasonably <br/>
incurred. As noted in section VIII.D.4, that exception generally does not allow for the recovery <br/>
of royalties or other fees associated with intangible assets. However, the exception does allow for <br/>
the reasonable and actual development and acquisition costs of such assets.  <br/>

We request comment on the categorical exclusions outlined above. In particular, we <br/>
encourage commenters to weigh in on our assumption that these practices are inherently likely to <br/>
interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. We also encourage commenters to suggest any <br/>
conceivable benefits that these practices might offer for interoperability or for competition and <br/>
consumers that we might have overlooked. Again, we ask that to the extent possible commenters <br/>
provide detailed economic rationale in support of their comments.  <br/>
<i>Non-disclosure agreement. </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose that an actor would be permitted under this exception to require a licensee to <br/>
agree to a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to protect the actor’s trade secrets, <br/>
provided that the NDA is no broader than necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the <br/>
actor’s trade secrets. Further, we propose that the actor would have to identify (in the NDA) the <br/>
specific information that it claims as trade secrets, and that such information would have to meet <br/>
definition of a trade secret under applicable law. We believe these safeguards are necessary to <br/>
ensure that the NDA is not used to impose restrictions or burdensome requirements that are not <br/>
actually necessary to protect the actor’s trade secrets and that impede the use of the <br/>
interoperability elements. The use of an NDA for such purposes would preclude an actor from <br/>
qualifying for this exception and would implicate the information blocking provision. We note <br/>
that if the actor is a health IT developer of certified health IT, it may be subject to the Condition <br/>
of Certification proposed in § 170.403, which prohibits certain health IT developer prohibitions <br/>
and restrictions on communications about a health IT developer’s technology and business <br/>
practices. This exception would not in any way abrogate the developer’s obligations to comply <br/>
with that condition.  <br/>

 <br/>
We encourage comment on this condition of the proposed exception.  <br/>
ii. Additional Requirements Relating to the Provision of Interoperability <br/>
Elements <br/>
 <br/>
In addition to the conditions described above, we propose that an actor’s practice would <br/>
need to comply with additional conditions that ensure that actors who license interoperability <br/>
elements on RAND terms do not engage in separate practices that impede the use of those <br/>
elements or otherwise undermine the intent of this exception. These conditions are analogous to <br/>
the conditions described in our proposal above concerning collateral terms but address a broader <br/>
range of practices that may not be effected through the license agreements themselves or that <br/>
occur separately from the licensing negotiations and other dealings between the actor and the <br/>
licensee. Specifically, we propose that an actor would not qualify for this exception if it engaged <br/>
in a practice that had the purpose or effect of impeding the efficient use of the interoperability <br/>
elements to access, exchange, or use EHI for any permissible purpose; or the efficient <br/>
development, distribution, deployment, or use of an interoperable product or service for which <br/>
there is actual or potential demand. As an illustration, the exception would not apply if the <br/>
developer licensed its proprietary APIs for use by third-party apps but then prevented or delayed <br/>
the use of those apps in production environments by, for example, restricting or discouraging <br/>
customers from enabling the use of the apps, or engaging in “gate keeping” practices, such as <br/>
requiring apps to go through a vetting process and then applying that process in a discriminatory <br/>
or unreasonable manner. <br/>
 <br/>
Finally, to ensure the actor’s commitments under this exception are durable, we propose <br/>
one additional safeguard: An actor cannot avail itself of this exception if, having licensed the <br/>

interoperability elements, the actor makes changes to the elements or its technology that “break” <br/>
compatibility or otherwise degrade the performance or interoperability of the licensee’s products <br/>
or services. We believe this condition is crucial given the ease with which an actor could make <br/>
subtle “tweaks” to its technology or related services that could disrupt the use of the licensee’s <br/>
compatible technologies or services and result in substantial competitive and consumer injury.  <br/>
 <br/>
We clarify and emphasize that this proposed condition would in <i>no way</i> prevent an actor <br/>
from making improvements to its technology or responding to the needs of its own customers or <br/>
users. However, to benefit from the exception, the actor’s practice would need to be necessary to <br/>
accomplish these purposes and the actor must have afforded the licensee a reasonable <br/>
opportunity under the circumstances to update its technology to maintain interoperability. We <br/>
also recognize that an actor may have to suspend access or make other changes immediately and <br/>
without prior notice in response to legitimate privacy, security, or patient safety-related <br/>
exigencies. Such practices would be governed by the exceptions proposed in section VIII.D of <br/>
this preamble and thus would not need to qualify for this exception.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
iii. Compliance with Conditions of Certification <br/>
 <br/>
As a final condition of this proposed exception, we propose that health IT developers of <br/>
certified health IT who are subject to the Conditions of Certification proposed in §§ 170.402, <br/>
170.403, and 170.404 must comply with all requirements of those Conditions of Certification for <br/>
all practices and at all relevant times. Several of the requirements of these conditions mirror <br/>
those of this exception. However, in some instances the Conditions of Certification provide <br/>
additional or more specific requirements that apply to the provision of interoperability elements <br/>
by developers of certified health IT. For example, developers subject to the API Condition of <br/>

Certification must make certain public APIs available on terms that are royalty free and no less <br/>
favorable than provided to themselves and their customers, suppliers, partners, and other persons <br/>
with whom they have a business relationship. These more prescriptive requirements reflect the <br/>
specific obligations of health IT developers under the Program, including the duty to facilitate <br/>
the access, exchange, and use of information from patients’ electronic health records without <br/>
special effort. A health IT developer of certified health IT’s failure to comply with these and <br/>
other certification requirements that specifically support interoperability would, in addition to <br/>
precluding the developer from invoking this exception, be significant evidence of information <br/>
blocking.  <br/>
7. <br/>
Maintaining and Improving Health IT Performance <br/>
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking provision for certain <br/>
practices that are reasonable and necessary to maintain and improve the overall performance of <br/>
health IT, provided certain conditions are met. The proposed exception would recognize as <br/>
reasonable and necessary the practice of an actor making health IT under its control temporarily <br/>
unavailable to maintain or improve the health IT. The exception and corresponding conditions <br/>
are set forth in the proposed regulation text in § 171.207. <br/>
 <br/>
EHI should be accessible and usable on demand by those that need it. However, in order <br/>
for this to happen, the health IT through which EHI is accessed, exchanged, or used must <br/>
perform properly and efficiently. This requires that health IT be maintained and in some <br/>
instances improved. The performance of such maintenance and improvements sometimes <br/>
requires that health IT is temporarily taken offline, which can interfere with the access, <br/>
exchange, and use of EHI. We believe this exception is necessary to ensure that actors are not <br/>

 <br/>
deterred from maintaining and improving the overall performance of health IT because <br/>
temporary unavailability of EHI may cause interference with its access, exchange, and use. <br/>
Without this specific exception, there could be a significant risk that actors may refrain from <br/>
conducting maintenance and improvements of health IT out of fear that if the purpose was not <br/>
for preventing harm, promoting security, or for another reason covered by the other exceptions, <br/>
then their actions might contravene the information blocking provision.  <br/>
This exception would apply to the unavailability of health IT occasioned by both planned <br/>
and unplanned maintenance and improvements. Planned maintenance or improvements are <br/>
typically carried out at regular intervals and address routine repairs, updates, or new releases. <br/>
Unplanned maintenance or improvements respond to urgent or time-sensitive issues, which <br/>
cannot wait for the occurrence of a pre-planned time period to implement the required <br/>
maintenance or improvements.  <br/>
This proposed exception acknowledges that the performance of health IT is often <br/>
measured by service level agreements that provide flexibility to ensure that system availability is <br/>
balanced with essential maintenance and improvements. Where the provision of health IT is <br/>
subject to an allowance for maintenance or improvement that has been agreed to by the recipient <br/>
of that health IT, we propose that neither that agreement, nor the performance of it, should <br/>
constitute information blocking, provided that certain conditions are met.    <br/>
To ensure that the actor’s practice of making health IT, and in turn EHI, unavailable for <br/>
the purpose of carrying out maintenance or improvements is reasonable and necessary, we have <br/>
identified conditions that must be satisfied at all relevant times to qualify for this exception.  <br/>

<i>Unavailability of health IT must be for no longer than necessary to achieve the </i><br/>
<i>maintenance or improvements for which the health IT was made unavailable </i><br/>
Any unavailability of health IT must be for a period of time no longer than necessary to <br/>
achieve the maintenance or improvement purpose for which the health IT is made unavailable. <br/>
This condition recognizes the critical importance of access to EHI and ensures that health IT is <br/>
not made unavailable for longer than needed. For example, a health IT developer of certified <br/>
health IT that has the right under its contract with a large health system to take its system offline <br/>
for four hours each month to conduct routine maintenance would not qualify for this exception if <br/>
an information blocking claim was made about a period of unavailability during which no <br/>
maintenance was performed. <br/>
Making this evaluation for unplanned maintenance or improvements will be more <br/>
difficult, because unplanned maintenance or improvements are typically initiated in response to a <br/>
threat or risk that needs to be responded to on an urgent basis and for so long as the threat or risk <br/>
persists. However, if, for example, an HIE identified a software failure (not identified as a safety <br/>
or security risk) that required immediate remediation necessitating the actor take its health IT <br/>
offline, the actor would be expected to bring the health IT back online as soon as possible after <br/>
the issue was resolved. <br/>
<i>Unavailability of health IT for maintenance or improvements must be implemented in a </i><br/>
<i>consistent and non-discriminatory manner </i><br/>
We propose that any unavailability of health IT occasioned by the conduct of <br/>
maintenance or improvements must be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory <br/>
manner. This condition provides a basic assurance that when health IT is made unavailable for <br/>

 <br/>
the purpose of performing maintenance or improvements that the unavailability is not abused by <br/>
the actor that controls the health IT. For example, a health IT developer of certified health IT <br/>
would not qualify for this exception if the developer, using a standard contract that provided a <br/>
flexible allowance for planned maintenance or improvements, initiated planned maintenance or <br/>
improvements for a customer with an expiring health IT contract during a time when users might <br/>
reasonably be expected to access EHI, but conducted planned maintenance or improvements for <br/>
new customers in the middle of the night. However, this condition does not require that actors <br/>
conduct planned maintenance or improvements simultaneously, or require that every health IT <br/>
contract provide the same promises in regard to planned maintenance or improvements. Indeed, a <br/>
recipient of health IT may agree to a longer window for unavailability in exchange for a reduced <br/>
fee for system maintenance, which would not contravene this condition. <br/>
<i>Unavailability of health IT for maintenance or improvements must be agreed </i><br/>
In order to benefit from this exception, we propose that the unavailability of health IT due <br/>
to maintenance or improvements initiated by a health IT developer of certified health IT, HIE, or <br/>
HIN, must be agreed to by the individual or entity to whom the health IT is supplied. The <br/>
availability of health IT is typically addressed in a written contract or other written agreements, <br/>
that puts the recipient of the health IT on notice about the level of EHI and health IT <br/>
unavailability that can be expected for users of the health IT. By such agreements, the recipient <br/>
of the health IT willfully agrees to that level of planned and unplanned unavailability (typically <br/>
referred to in health IT contracts as “downtime”). Some health IT contracts address the question <br/>
of system availability by way of an “uptime warranty” that specifies the maximum amount of <br/>
unavailability for a specified period and the timing of any planned unavailability.  <br/>

 <br/>
We acknowledge that in some cases, health IT needs to be taken offline or maintenance <br/>
or improvements on an urgent basis and in a way that is not expressly permitted under a health <br/>
IT contract. An actor may still satisfy this proposed condition so long as the maintenance or <br/>
improvements are agreed to by the recipient of the health IT. This could be achieved by way of <br/>
an oral agreement reached between the parties by telephone, but we note that because an actor <br/>
must demonstrate that it satisfies the requirements of this exception, it would be best practice for <br/>
an actor to ensure the agreement was in writing or, at minimum, contemporaneously <br/>
documented. <br/>
This proposed condition of this exception only applies when the unavailability of health <br/>
IT is caused by a health IT developer of certified health IT, HIE, or HIN. In these circumstances, <br/>
it is the supplier of the health IT that controls if and when health IT is intentionally taken offline <br/>
for maintenance or improvements. This condition does not apply when health IT is made <br/>
unavailable for maintenance or improvements at the initiative of a recipient (or customer) of <br/>
health IT, because in that case, the unavailability has, for the purpose of this exception, nothing <br/>
to do with the supplier. When it is a customer of health IT that initiates unavailability, the <br/>
unavailability would not need to be the subject of an agreement with the supplier of that health <br/>
IT, nor anyone else, in order for the customer of health IT to benefit from this exception. For <br/>
example, a health care provider that locally hosts and maintains its health IT (being software <br/>
supplied by a health IT developer) would not need to satisfy this condition if it interfered with <br/>
access to EHI by taking the health IT offline temporarily to conduct maintenance. However, if <br/>
the same health care provider was to receive a new release of the health IT developer’s software, <br/>
which was to be implemented by the developer and which required that the health IT be taken <br/>

offline by the developer for 6 hours, then that unavailability, or an allowance for it, would need <br/>
to be the subject of prior agreement. Unavailability of health IT initiated by a recipient of health <br/>
IT (rather than the supplier of the health IT) would still need to satisfy the other conditions of <br/>
this exception, including that the unavailability be for a period of time no longer than necessary <br/>
to achieve the maintenance or improvements for which the health IT was made unavailable. <br/>
We note that this condition would need to be satisfied by any HIE or HIN that sought to <br/>
benefit from this exception in connection with any interference with access, exchange, or use <br/>
occasioned by an HIE or HIN making its health IT unavailable for the purposes of conducting <br/>
maintenance or improvements. An HIE would need to have secured the agreement of those <br/>
individuals or entities that use its exchange services, and a HIN would need to have obtained the <br/>
agreement of the network’s participants. <br/>
 <br/>
<i>Interaction with Preventing Harm and Promoting Security Exceptions </i><br/>
When health IT is made unavailable for maintenance or improvements aimed at <br/>
preventing harm to a patient or other person, or securing EHI, an actor must comply with the <br/>
conditions specified in proposed § 171.201 or § 171.203 respectively, in order to qualify for an <br/>
exception to the information blocking provision. This condition ensures that this exception <br/>
cannot be used to avoid compliance with conditions applicable under other exceptions. For <br/>
example, if part of an EHR system was taken offline in response to a health IT developer of <br/>
certified health IT being alerted to the risk of corrupt or inaccurate data being recorded or <br/>
incorporated in a patient’s health record, any decision to make the EHR unavailable on this basis <br/>
to conduct unplanned maintenance or improvements would need to accord with the conditions of <br/>
the proposed exception for preventing harm (see § 171.201 and section VIII.D.1 of this proposed <br/>

rule). Similarly, unavailability occasioned by maintenance or improvements initiated to secure <br/>
EHI in response to a suspected malware attack would need to either be implemented in <br/>
accordance with the actor’s organizational security policy that satisfied the requirements of the <br/>
proposed exception for promoting the security of EHI or if the practice did not implement an <br/>
organizational security policy, the actor must have made a determination in each case, based on <br/>
the particularized facts and circumstances, consistent with the requirements of the exception (see <br/>
§ 171.203(d) and section VIII.D.3 of this proposed rule). <br/>
<i>Request for Comment </i><br/>
We seek comment on this exception generally. Specifically, we seek comment on <br/>
whether the proposed conditions impose appropriate limitations on actor-initiated health IT <br/>
maintenance or improvements that lead to EHI unavailability. Our goal is to ensure that the <br/>
exception is not abused, while at the same time recognizing reasonable commercial arrangements <br/>
entered into by parties for the proper maintenance and improvement of health IT.  <br/>
We are also considering whether to expand this exception to capture a broader class of <br/>
practices that are the subject of reasonable commercial agreements and which, in the absence of <br/>
an exception, may be considered information blocking. That is, to extend this exception or create <br/>
new exceptions for additional types of practices that interfere with access, exchange, or use of <br/>
EHI, but that are the subject of free agreement and which are reasonable and necessary. For <br/>
example, we are considering whether a practice taken by an actor to throttle or meter the <br/>
availability or performance of health IT, where agreed to by the recipient of that health IT, could <br/>
ever be a practice that we recognize as not being information blocking if such practice does not <br/>
otherwise qualify under an existing exception.  <br/>

 <br/>
As discussed in section VIII.C.5 of this preamble, we are aware that actors can use <br/>
commercial agreements to materially discourage, and in some instances outright prohibit, certain <br/>
instances of access, exchange, or use of EHI. For example, a HIN might use a participation <br/>
agreement to prohibit entities that receive EHI through the HIN from transmitting that EHI to <br/>
entities who are not participants of the HIN. Such an arrangement would not be reasonable or <br/>
necessary because there is no legitimate justification for it. However, we are also aware of <br/>
commercial arrangements that are not motivated by anti-competitive considerations but that <br/>
nonetheless have the effect of interfering with the access, exchange, or use of EHI. For example, <br/>
a health IT developer of certified health IT may agree to commercial terms with a customer that <br/>
have the effect of interfering with access, exchange, or use of EHI, but which are designed to <br/>
appropriately accommodate the customer’s limited resources, or to assure the performance of <br/>
certain health IT functionality.  <br/>
We expect that most reasonable and necessary commercial arrangements that affect <br/>
access, exchange, or use of EHI could be recognized under one or more of the existing <br/>
exceptions. However, we seek comment on whether there exists a class of legitimate commercial <br/>
arrangements that could implicate the information blocking provision, but which would not <br/>
benefit from the existing proposed exceptions. <br/>

products (or other entities offering such products to health care providers) not being <br/>
interoperable or resulting in information blocking; and false statements by developers of certified <br/>
health IT that they have not engaged in information blocking. Section 3022(d)(3)(B) further <br/>

Secretary sets forth through notice and comment rulemaking. However, we note that these <br/>
disincentives may not cover the full range of conduct within the scope of section 3022(a)(1). We <br/>

<b>IX. Registries Request for Information <br/> <br/></b> <br/>
Section 4005 (a) and (b) of the Cures Act focuses on interoperability and bidirectional <br/>
exchange between EHRs and registries, including clinician-led clinical data registries. ONC is <br/>
approaching these provisions from several angles to address the technical capability of EHRs to <br/>
exchange data with registries in accordance with applicable recognized standards. Based on <br/>
stakeholder engagement and public comments on prior ONC regulations, we have identified a <br/>
wide range of areas where the use of standards could significantly improve bidirectional <br/>
exchange with registries for a range of purposes, including public health, quality reporting, and <br/>
care quality improvement.   <br/>
 <br/>
As discussed in the “Strategy on Reducing Regulatory and Administrative Burden <br/>
Relating to the Use of Health IT and EHRs” draft report released by ONC for public comment in <br/>
December of 2018,<a href="ONCs.html#502">136 </a>health care providers are faced with a myriad of federal public health <br/>
reporting requirements and options that rely on both bidirectional exchange and aggregation of <br/>
clinical data. CDC, SAMHSA, FDA, HRSA, and USDA also fund state and local public health <br/>
jurisdictions to collect clinical data from health care providers. As noted in the Cures Act, there <br/>

 <br/>
are also a wide range of clinician-led quality and specialty clinical data registries. Compounding <br/>
these reporting requirements and options is, as reported by health care providers, a lack of <br/>
standardization across electronic infrastructure that has led to a comparatively slow adoption of <br/>
health IT systems among registries. This lack of interoperability impacts not only data exchange <br/>
between health care providers, but is a significant barrier to the integration and potential use of <br/>
clinical data received from a registry for quality improvement or clinical care.   <br/>
 <br/>
For these reasons outlined above, we believe it is appropriate to explore multiple <br/>
approaches to advancing health IT interoperability for bidirectional exchange with registries in <br/>
order to mitigate risks based on factors like feasibility and readiness, potential unintended burden <br/>
on health care providers, and the need to focus on priority clinical use cases. ONC is in the <br/>
process of conducting research and analysis to determine what evidence-based use cases should <br/>
be supported and what standards are available to support such use cases. We are also considering <br/>
the overall maturity of technology adoption within the market to support identified standards and <br/>
the use of certified EHRs and clinical data registries for these identified use cases in the near <br/>
term, as well as identifying glide paths for the potential future development of enterprise <br/>
solutions.   <br/>
In the 2015 Edition final rule, we included certification criteria and standards that are <br/>
applicable for specific use cases for bidirectional exchange such as Immunization Information <br/>
Systems. In this proposed rule, we have proposed processes for updating standards as well as <br/>
new policies related to real world testing that would help ensure that functionalities are <br/>
implemented in a manner that is technically feasible in a practice setting. In addition, we have <br/>
worked with federal partners to advance health IT policies related to bidirectional exchange with <br/>

registries in a manner that supports and reflects the current market place while encouraging <br/>
innovation and increased adoption. For example, we have worked with CMS to enhance <br/>
guidance for QCDRs under the MIPS to support health IT innovation and partnership with health <br/>
IT organizations. We are also working with the CDC and states to support enhancements to <br/>
PDMP integration as a priority use case for standards-based health IT solutions. We believe <br/>
these efforts can help to address the near term need to support high priority use cases for <br/>
bidirectional exchange between health care providers and registries.  <br/>
 <br/>
In this proposed rule, we propose to adopt new standards and capabilities for certified <br/>
APIs that have the potential to change how certain types of information exchange are done, <br/>
including the potential to exchange information with clinical data and public health registries. In <br/>
this request for information (RFI), we are seeking information on how health IT solutions and the <br/>
proposals throughout this rule can aid bidirectional exchange with registries for a wide range <br/>
public health, quality reporting, and clinical quality improvement initiatives. For example, in <br/>
December of 2018, in the “Strategy on Reducing Regulatory and Administrative Burden <br/>
Relating to the Use of Health IT and EHRs” draft report, we noted that HL7 was working on an <br/>
update to the FHIR standard to support API access to request data on populations of patients, <br/>
which could potentially address additional use cases, including supporting payer needs, public <br/>
health and quality improvement efforts, and health research organizations. As discussed in <br/>
section VII.4, FHIR Release 4 has now been published85 and updated associated implementation <br/>
specifications are expected to follow. FHIR Release 4 has several key improvements, including <br/>
certain foundational aspects in the standard and “FHIR resources” designated as “normative” for <br/>
the first time. This will lead to a cycle of more mature US FHIR Core profiles aligned with <br/>

Release 4 and additional implementation guidance that explicitly specifies how to handle <br/>
populations of patient data (batch exports) via FHIR to more efficiently enable population and <br/>
learning health system-oriented services.  <br/>
We seek comment on use cases where an API using FHIR Release 4 might support <br/>
improved exchange between a provider and a registry. Specifically, we seek comment on how <br/>
the use of this standard might:  <br/>
•  Reduce the burden of implementing multiple solutions for various types of exchange, <br/>
while still supporting the variability needed to exchange information with registries <br/>
devoted to the care of a population defined by a particular disease, condition, exposure, <br/>
or therapy; <br/>
•  Allow for the collection of detailed, standardized data on an ongoing basis for medical <br/>
procedures, services, or therapies for particular diseases, conditions, or exposures;  <br/>
•  Support an overall approach to data quality, including the systematic collection of clinical <br/>
and other health care data, using standardized data elements and procedures to verify the <br/>
completeness and validity of those data;  <br/>
•  Improve and enhance the ability of providers to leverage feedback from a registry to <br/>
improve patient care; and <br/>
•  Address a sufficiently wide range of use cases to warrant the prioritization of technical <br/>
innovation on API-based options over the continued development of use-case-specific <br/>
solutions in future rulemaking.  <br/>

We also welcome any other comments stakeholders may have on implementation of the <br/>
registries provisions under section 4005 of the Cures Act. <br/>

<b>X. Patient Matching Request for Information <br/> </b><br/>
Patient matching is a critical component to interoperability and the nation’s health <br/>
information technology infrastructure. Accurate patient matching helps health care providers <br/>
access and share the right information on the right patient when and where it is needed.  <br/>
Inaccurate patient matching can compromise safety, privacy, and lead to increased health care <br/>
costs, as acknowledged in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and <br/>
Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Bill, 2017<a href="ONCs.html#506">137</a>: <br/>
The Committee is aware that one of the most significant challenges inhibiting the <br/>safe and secure electronic exchange of health information is the lack of a <br/>consistent patient data matching strategy. With the passage of the HITECH Act, a <br/>clear mandate was placed on the Nation’s healthcare community to adopt <br/>electronic health records and health exchange capability. Although the Committee <br/>continues to carry a prohibition against HHS using funds to promulgate or adopt <br/>any final standard providing for the assignment of a unique health identifier for an <br/>individual until such activity is authorized, the Committee notes that this <br/>limitation does not prohibit HHS from examining the issues around patient <br/>matching. Accordingly, the Committee encourages the Secretary, acting through <br/>the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and <br/>CMS, to provide technical assistance to private-sector led initiatives to develop a <br/>coordinated national strategy that will promote patient safety by accurately <br/>identifying patients to their health information. <br/>
 <br/>
Similarly, the Fiscal Year 2018 Appropriations Bill<a href="ONCs.html#506">138 </a>also included language regarding <br/>
patient matching. <br/>
The Committee is aware that a challenge inhibiting the safe and secure electronic <br/>exchange of health information is the lack of a consistent approach to matching patient <br/>data. The Committee encourages ONC to engage with stakeholders on private-sector led <br/>initiatives to develop a coordinated strategy that will promote patient safety by accurately <br/>identifying patients to their health information. <br/>

Section 4007 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) directs the Government <br/>
Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study on patient matching. Specifically, the GAO was <br/>
charged to review the policies and activities of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health <br/>
Information Technology (ONC) and other relevant stakeholders, including standards <br/>
development organizations, developers, providers, suppliers, payers, quality organizations, <br/>
States, health information technology policy and technical experts, and other appropriate entities. <br/>
The GAO report, <i>Approaches and Challenges to Electronically Matching Patients’ Records </i><br/>
<i>across Providers</i>, was released in January 2019.<a href="ONCs.html#507">139</a> In this report, GAO describes (1) <br/>
stakeholders’ patient record matching approaches and related challenges; and (2) efforts to <br/>
improve patient record matching identified by stakeholders. Stakeholders said more could be <br/>
done to improve patient record matching, and identified several efforts that could improve <br/>
matching. For example, some said that implementing common standards for recording <br/>
demographic data; sharing best practices and other resources; and developing a public-private <br/>
collaboration effort could each improve matching. Stakeholders’ views varied on the roles ONC <br/>
and others should play in these efforts and the extent to which the efforts would improve <br/>
matching. Multiple stakeholders emphasized that no single effort would solve the challenge of <br/>
patient record matching.  <br/>
Patient matching may be defined as the linking of one patient’s data within and across <br/>
health care providers in order to obtain a comprehensive and longitudinal view of that patient’s <br/>
health care. At a minimum, this is accomplished by linking multiple demographic data fields <br/>

such as name, birth date, sex, phone number, and address. For this reason, accurate and <br/>
standardized data capture and exchange and optimized algorithm performance are critical <br/>
components to the accurate patient matching. With this in mind, ONC has taken several steps to <br/>
better understand the patient matching landscape and to identify areas where ONC can assist in <br/>
standards and technical development, coordination, and innovation. For example, in 2017, ONC <br/>
launched the Patient Matching Algorithm Challenge, where six winners were awarded total prize <br/>
winnings of $75,000.<a href="ONCs.html#508">140</a> The goals of this challenge were to bring about greater transparency and <br/>
data on the performance of existing patient matching algorithms, spur the adoption of <br/>
performance metrics for patient matching algorithm developers, and positively impact other <br/>
aspects of patient matching such as deduplication and linking. In addition, in 2018, ONC <br/>
showcased innovative technical and non-technical approaches to matching through hosting a <br/>
patient matching track at ONC’s Second Interoperability Forum.<a href="ONCs.html#508">141</a> <br/>
In this Request for Information (RFI), we seek comment on additional opportunities that <br/>
may exist in the patient matching space and ways that ONC can lead and contribute to <br/>
coordination efforts with respect to patient matching. ONC and CMS collaborated to jointly issue <br/>
complementary requests for information regarding patient matching. ONC is particularly <br/>
interested in ways that patient matching can facilitate improved patient safety, better care <br/>
coordination, and advanced interoperability. Inaccurate patient matching can lead to <br/>
inappropriate and unnecessary care; unnecessary burden on both patients and providers to correct <br/>

reconcile duplicate patient records and improper record merges; and poor oversite into fraud and <br/>
abuse. Per a survey by the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives, one in <br/>
five providers named lack of an appropriate patient matching strategy as the primary reason for <br/>
inadvertent illness or injury<a href="ONCs.html#509">142. W</a>e consider this a quality of care and patient safety issue and <br/>
seek stakeholder input on creative, innovative, and effective approaches to patient matching <br/>
within and across providers. We also intend to review the responses to this RFI in concert with <br/>
the GAO report once published. <br/>
We specifically seek input on the following:  <br/>
•  It is a common misconception that technology alone can solve the problem of poor data <br/>
quality, but even the most advanced, innovative technical approaches are unable to <br/>
overcome data quality issues. Thus, we seek input on the potential effect that data <br/>
collection standards may have on the quality of health data that is captured and stored and <br/>
the impact that such standards may have on accurate patient matching. We also seek <br/>
input on other solutions that may increase the likelihood of accurate data capture, <br/>
including the implementation of technology that supports the verification and <br/>
authentication of certain demographic data elements such as mailing address, as well as <br/>
other efforts that support ongoing data quality improvement efforts. <br/>
•  In concert with the GAO study referenced above, we seek input on what additional data <br/>
elements could be defined to assist in patient matching as well as input on a required <br/>
minimum set of elements that need to be collected and exchanged. We encourage <br/>
                                                 <br/>

implementation specifications outlined. Public comments and subject matter feedback on <br/>
all sections of the Interoperability Standards Advisory are accepted year round.   <br/>
•  Also in alignment with the GAO study, we seek input on whether and what requirements <br/>
for electronic health records could be established to assure data used for patient matching <br/>
is collected accurately and completely for every patient. For instance, the adopted 2015 <br/>
Edition “transitions of care” certification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)) currently includes <br/>
patient matching requirements for first name, last name, previous name, middle name, <br/>
suffix, date of birth, address, phone number, and sex. These requirement also include <br/>
format constraints for some of the data.  <br/>
•  There are unique matching issues related to pediatrics and we seek comment on <br/>
innovative and effective technical or non-technical approaches that could support <br/>
accurate pediatric record matching.  <br/>
•  Recent research suggests that involving patients in patient matching may be a viable and <br/>
effective solution to increase the accuracy of matching, and giving patients access to their <br/>
own clinical information empowers engagements and improved health outcomes. We <br/>
seek comment on potential solutions that include patients through a variety of methods <br/>
and technical platforms in the capture, update and maintenance of their own demographic <br/>
and health data, including privacy criteria and the role of providers as educators and <br/>
advocates. <br/>

•  In addition, we seek input on standardized metrics for the performance evaluation of <br/>
available patient matching algorithms. Health IT developers are each relying on a number <br/>
of patient matching algorithms, however, without the adoption of agreed upon metrics for <br/>
the evaluation of algorithm performance across the industry, existing matching <br/>
approaches cannot be accurately evaluated or compared across systems or over time.  <br/>
•  At the same time, we seek input on transparent patient matching indicators such as <br/>
database duplicate rate, duplicate creation rate, and true match rate, for example, that are <br/>
necessary for assessment and reporting. The current lack of consensus, adoption, and <br/>
transparency of such indicators makes communication, reporting, and cross-provider or <br/>
cross-organizational comparisons impossible, impedes a full and accurate assessment of <br/>
the extent of the problem, prohibits informed decision making, limits research on <br/>
complementary matching methods, and inhibits progress and innovation in this area. <br/>
•  There are a number of emerging private-sector led approaches in patient matching that <br/>
may prove to be effective, and we seek input on these approaches, in general. A number <br/>
of matching services that leverage referential matching technology have emerged in the <br/>
market recently, yet evaluations of this type of approach has either not been conducted or <br/>
has not been made public. Other innovative technical approaches such as biometrics, <br/>
machine learning and artificial intelligence, or locally developed unique identifier efforts, <br/>
when used in combination with non-technical approaches such as patient engagement, <br/>
supportive policies, data governance, and ongoing data quality improvement efforts may <br/>
enhance capacity for matching.  <br/>

<b>XI. Incorporation by Reference </b><br/>
The Office of the <b>Federal Register </b>has established requirements for materials (e.g., <br/>
standards and implementation specifications) that agencies propose to incorporate by reference <br/>
in the <b>Code of Federal Regulations</b> (79 FR 66267; 1 CFR 51.5(a)). Specifically, § 51.5(a) <br/>
requires agencies to discuss, in the preamble of a proposed rule, the ways that the materials it <br/>
proposes to incorporate by reference are reasonably available to interested parties or how it <br/>
worked to make those materials reasonably available to interested parties; and summarize, in the <br/>
preamble of the proposed rule, the material it proposes to incorporate by reference.  <br/>
To make the materials we intend to incorporate by reference reasonably available, we <br/>
provide a uniform resource locator (URL) for the standards and implementation specifications. <br/>
In many cases, these standards and implementation specifications are directly accessible through <br/>
the URLs provided. In most of these instances, access to the standard or implementation <br/>
specification can be gained through no-cost (monetary) participation, subscription, or <br/>
membership with the applicable standards developing organization (SDO) or custodial <br/>
organization. Alternatively, a copy of the standards may be viewed for free at the U.S. <br/>
Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the National Coordinator for Health <br/>
Information Technology, 330 C Street SW, Washington, DC 20201. Please call (202) 690-7171 <br/>

The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) of 1995 (15 U.S.C. <br/>
3701 et seq.) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A–119 require the use <br/>
of, wherever practical, technical standards that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus <br/>
standards bodies to carry out policy objectives or activities, with certain exceptions. The NTTAA <br/>
and OMB Circular A-119 provide exceptions to selecting only standards developed or adopted <br/>
by voluntary consensus standards bodies, namely when doing so would be inconsistent with <br/>
applicable law or otherwise impractical. As discussed in section IV of this preamble, we have <br/>
followed the NTTAA and OMB Circular A-119 in proposing standards and implementation <br/>
specifications for adoption, including describing any exceptions in the proposed adoption of <br/>
standards and implementation specifications. Over the years of adopting standards and <br/>
implementation specifications for certification, we have worked with SDOs, such as HL7, to <br/>
make the standards we propose to adopt, and subsequently adopt and incorporate by reference in <br/>
the Federal Register, available to interested stakeholders. As described above, this includes <br/>
making the standards and implementation specifications available through no-cost memberships <br/>
and no-cost subscriptions. <br/>
As required by § 51.5(a), we provide summaries of the standards we propose to adopt and <br/>
subsequently incorporate by reference in the <b>Code of Federal Regulations</b>. We also provide <br/>
relevant information about these standards and implementation specifications throughout the <br/>
preamble.  <br/>
We have organized the following standards and implementation specifications that we <br/>

Summary: SMART on FHIR provides reliable, secure authorization for a variety of app <br/>
architectures through the use of the OAuth 2.0 standard. This Authorization Guide supports the <br/>
four uses cases defined for Phase 1 of the Argonaut Project. This profile is intended to be used <br/>
by developers of apps that need to access FHIR resources by requesting access tokens from <br/>
OAuth 2.0 compliant authorization servers. The profile defines a method through which an app <br/>
requests authorization to access a FHIR resource, and then uses that authorization to retrieve the <br/>
resource. Other Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-mandated security <br/>
mechanisms, such as end-user authentication, session time-out, security auditing, and accounting <br/>
of disclosures, are outside the scope of this profile. <br/>

OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA requires that we solicit comment on the following <br/>
issues: <br/>
1.  Whether the information collection is necessary and useful to carry out the proper <br/>
functions of the agency; <br/>
2.  The accuracy of the agency’s estimate of the information collection burden; <br/>
3.  The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and <br/>
4.  Recommendations to minimize the information collection burden on the affected <br/>
public, including automated collection techniques. <br/>
Under the PRA, the time, effort, and financial resources necessary to meet the <br/>
information collection requirements referenced in this section are to be considered. We explicitly <br/>
seek, and will consider, public comment on our assumptions as they relate to the PRA <br/>
requirements summarized in this section. To comment on the collection of information or to <br/>
obtain copies of the supporting statements and any related forms for the proposed paperwork <br/>

<i>A. ONC-ACBs </i><br/>
We propose to add new ONC-ACB collection and reporting requirements for the <br/>

As proposed for §§ 170.550(l), ONC-ACBs would not be able to certify health IT until <br/>
they review and verify health IT developers’ attestations confirming that the developers are <br/>
compliant with Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements. ONC-ACBs would <br/>
also submit the health IT developer attestations to ONC as proposed by § 170.523(q). We believe <br/>
this will require minimal effort on behalf of ONC-ACBs as the ONC submission part will be <br/>
electronically facilitated via the CHPL.  <br/>
As proposed for § 170.523(p)(3), ONC-ACBs would be required to collect and report <br/>
certain information to ONC related to real world testing plans and results. ONC-ACBs would be <br/>
required to verify that the health IT developer submits an annual, publicly available real world <br/>
testing plan and perform a completeness check for both real world testing plans and results. We <br/>
believe ONC-ACBs will face minimum burden in complying with these new proposed <br/>
requirements.  <br/>
As proposed for § 170.523(t), ONC-ACBs would ensure health IT developers opting to <br/>
take advantage of the Standard Version Advancement Process flexibility per § 170.405(b)(5) <br/>
provide timely advance written notice to the ONC-ACB and all affected customers. ONC-ACBs <br/>
would maintain a record of the date of issuance and the content of developers’ notices, and <br/>
timely post content of each notice received publicly on the CHPL attributed to the certified <br/>
Health IT Module(s) to which it applies. We believe this will require minimal effort on behalf of <br/>
ONC-ACBs as the submission part will be electronically facilitated via the CHPL. <br/>
In the 2015 Edition proposed rule (80 FR 16894), we estimated fewer than ten annual <br/>
respondents for all of the regulatory “collection of information” requirements that applied to the <br/>
ONC-AA and ONC-ACBs, including those previously approved by OMB. In the 2015 Edition <br/>

final rule (80 FR 62733), we concluded that the regulatory “collection of information” <br/>
requirements for the ONC-AA and the ONC-ACBs were not subject to the PRA under 5 CFR <br/>
1320.3(c). We continue to estimate less than ten annual respondents for all of the proposed <br/>
regulatory “collection of information” requirements for ONC-ACBs under Part 170 of Title 45, <br/>
including those previously approved by OMB and proposed in this proposed rule. Accordingly, <br/>
the regulatory “collection of information” requirements under the Program described in this <br/>
section are not subject to the PRA under 5 CFR 1320.3(c). We welcome comments on these <br/>
conclusions and the supporting rationale on which they are based. For costs estimates of these <br/>
proposed new regulatory requirements, we refer readers to section XIV. (<i>Regulatory Impact </i><br/>
<i>Analysis</i>) of this proposed rule. <br/>
<i>B. Health IT Developers </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose in 45 CFR 170.580(a)(2)(iii) that ONC may take action against a health IT <br/>
developer for failure to comply with Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements. <br/>
We proposed to generally use the same processes previously codified in regulation (§§ 170.580 <br/>
and 170.581) to take administrative enforcement action. These processes would require health IT <br/>
developers to submit information to ONC to facilitate and conclude its review. The PRA, <br/>
however, exempts these information collections. Specifically, 44 U.S.C. 3518(c)(1)(B)(ii) <br/>
excludes collection activities during the conduct of administrative actions or investigations <br/>
involving the agency against specific individuals or entities. <br/>
We propose in 45 CFR 170.402(b)(1) that a health IT developer must, for a period of 10 <br/>
years beginning from the date each of a developer’s health IT is first certified under the ONC <br/>
Health IT Certification Program, retain all records and information necessary to demonstrate <br/>

This proposed rule is necessary to meet our statutory responsibilities under the 21st <br/>
Century Cures Act (Cures Act) and to advance HHS policy goals to promote interoperability and <br/>
mitigate burden for stakeholders. Proposals that could result in monetary costs for stakeholders <br/>
include the: (1) proposals to update the 2015 Edition health IT certification criteria; (2) proposals <br/>
related to Conditions and Maintenance of Certification for a health IT developer; (3) proposals <br/>
related to oversight for the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification; and (4) proposals <br/>
related to information blocking.   <br/>
While much of the costs of this proposed rule will fall on health IT developers that seek <br/>
to certify health IT under the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program), we believe the <br/>

this proposed rule), compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification, and the <br/>
limited exceptions to information blocking proposed would ultimately result in significant <br/>
benefits for health care providers and patients. We outline some of these benefits below. We <br/>
emphasize in this regulatory impact analysis (RIA) that we believe this proposed rule would <br/>
create opportunities for new market entrants and would remove barriers to interoperability and <br/>
electronic health information exchange, which would greatly benefit health care providers and <br/>
patients.  <br/>
We note in this RIA that there were instances in which we had difficulty quantifying <br/>
certain benefits due to a lack of applicable studies and/or data. However, in such instances, we <br/>
highlight the significant qualitative benefits of our proposals to advance an interoperable health <br/>
system that empowers individuals to use their electronic health information (EHI) to the fullest <br/>
extent and enables health care providers and communities to deliver smarter, safer, and more <br/>
efficient care. <br/>
<i>B. Alternatives Considered </i> <br/>
We assessed whether there are alternatives to our proposals, specifically our proposals <br/>
concerning EHI export, application programming interfaces (APIs), and real world testing. We <br/>
have been unable to identify alternatives that would appropriately implement our responsibilities <br/>
under the Cures Act and support interoperability. We believe our proposals take the necessary <br/>
steps to fulfill the mandates specified in the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), as amended by <br/>
the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act and the <br/>
Cures Act, in the least burdensome way. We are, however, open to less burdensome alternatives <br/>

<i>C.  Overall Impact </i><br/>
We have examined the impact of this proposed rule as required by Executive Order <br/>
12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993), Executive Order 13563 on <br/>
Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (February 2, 2011), Executive Order 13771 on <br/>
Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. <br/>
601 <i>et seq.</i>), section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1532), and <br/>
Executive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999).  <br/>
1. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 – Regulatory Planning and Review Analysis  <br/>
Executive Orders 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review and 13563 on Improving <br/>
Regulation and Regulatory Review direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available <br/>
regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that <br/>
maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety <br/>
effects, distributive impacts, and equity). A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) must be prepared <br/>
for major rules with economically significant effects ($100 million or more in any one year). <br/>
OMB has determined that this proposed rule is an economically significant rule as the potential <br/>
costs associated with this proposed rule could be greater than $100 million per year. <br/>
Accordingly, we have prepared an RIA that to the best of our ability presents the costs and <br/>
benefits of this proposed rule. <br/>

regulatory actions. The new requirements under Executive Orders 13771 and 13777 do not <br/>
change or reduce existing requirements under Executive Orders 12866 or 13563.    <br/>
a. Costs and Benefits <br/>
We have estimated the potential monetary costs and benefits of this proposed rule for <br/>
health IT developers, health care providers, patients, ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies <br/>
(ONC-ACBs), ONC-Authorized Testing Laboratories (ONC-ATLs), and the federal government <br/>
(i.e., ONC), and have broken those costs and benefits out into the following categories: (1) <br/>
deregulatory actions (no associated costs); (2) updates the 2015 Edition Health IT certification <br/>
criteria; (3) Conditions and Maintenance of Certification for a health IT developer; (4) oversight <br/>
for the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification; and (5) information blocking.  <br/>
 <br/>
In accordance with Executive Order 12866, we have included the RIA summary table as <br/>
Table 29. In addition, we have included a summary to meet the regulatory reform analysis <br/>
requirements under Executive Order 13771. <br/>
 <br/>
We note that we have rounded all estimates to the nearest dollar and that all estimates are <br/>
expressed in 2016 dollars as it is the most recent data available to address all cost and benefit <br/>
estimates consistently. We also note that estimates presented in the following “Employee <br/>

For proposals where research supported direct estimates of impact, we estimated the <br/>
benefits. For proposals where no such research was identified to be available, we developed <br/>
estimates based on a reasonable proxy.  <br/>
 <br/>
We note that interoperability can positively impact patient safety, care coordination, and <br/>
improve health care processes and health outcomes.<a href="ONCs.html#530">144 </a>However, achieving interoperability is a <br/>
function of a number of factors including the capability of the technology used by health care <br/>
providers. Therefore, to assess the benefits of our proposals, we must first consider how to assess <br/>
their respective effects on interoperability holding other factors constant.  <br/>
 <br/>
For the purpose of this analysis, we used regression analysis to calculate the impact of <br/>
our real world testing and API proposals on interoperability. We assumed that the real world <br/>
testing and API proposals would collectively have the same impact on interoperability as health <br/>
IT certified to the 2014 Edition. Therefore, we estimated linear probability models that identified <br/>
the impact of 2014 Edition certified health IT on hospitals’ interoperability. <a href="ONCs.html#530">145</a> We used data <br/>

controlled for additional factors such as participation in a health information exchange <br/>
organization, hospital characteristics, and urban/rural status. More specifically, we used the <br/>
following explanatory variables: <br/>
Edition=1 if a hospital adopted 2014 Edition EHR, 0 otherwise <br/>RHIO=1 if a hospital participates in health information exchange organization, 0 <br/>otherwise <br/>Government=1 if a hospital is publically owned, 0 otherwise <br/>Alt_teaching=1 if a hospital is teaching, 0 otherwise <br/>Nonprofit=1 if a hospital is not for profit, 0 otherwise <br/>Largebed=1 if a hospital has more than 399 beds, 0 otherwise  <br/>Medbed=1 if a hospital’s number of beds is between 100 and 399, 0 otherwise <br/>Urban_rural=1 if a hospital is urban, 0 otherwise <br/>CAH=1 if a hospital is critical access, 0 otherwise <br/>Year=year of the data (2014 and 2015) <br/>S=state fixed effects <br/>
 <br/>
We found a statistically significant marginal effect of using 2014 Edition certified health IT <br/>
associated with a five percentage point increase in interoperability.<a href="ONCs.html#531">147</a> <br/>
 <br/>
While we acknowledge that there might be shared benefits across proposals, we have <br/>
taken steps to ensure that the benefits attributed to each proposal is unique to the proposal <br/>
referenced. We assumed that this marginal effect is true for our proposals and distributed the 5% <br/>
benefit across our real world testing and API proposals at (.1-1%) to (1-4%) respectively. <br/>
Moreover, the number of providers impacted is proposal specific. Given data limitations, we <br/>
believe this approach allows us to estimate the benefits of our proposals without double counting <br/>
the impact each proposal might have on interoperability.  <br/>

We have made employee assumptions about the level of expertise needed to complete the <br/>
proposed requirements in this section. For wage calculations for federal employees and ONC-<br/>
ACBs, we have correlated the employee’s expertise with the corresponding grade and step of an <br/>
employee classified under the General Schedule (GS) Federal Salary Classification, relying on <br/>
the associated employee hourly rates for the Washington, DC locality pay area as published by <br/>
the Office of Personnel Management for 2016.<a href="ONCs.html#532">148 </a>We have assumed that overhead costs <br/>
(including benefits) are equal to 100% of pre-tax wages. Therefore, we have doubled the <br/>
employee’s hourly wage to account for overhead costs. We have concluded that a 100% <br/>
expenditure on benefits is an appropriate estimate based on research conducted by HHS.<a href="ONCs.html#532">149</a> <br/>
We have used Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data to calculate private sector employee <br/>
wage estimates (e.g., health IT developers, health care providers, HINs, attorneys, etc.), as we <br/>
believe BLS provides the most accurate and comprehensive wage data for private sector <br/>
positions. Just as with the General Schedule Federal Salary Classification calculations, we have <br/>
assumed that overhead costs (including benefits) are equal to 100% of pre-tax wages. <br/>
All wage estimates (GS and BLS) have been calculated in 2016 dollars because OMB <br/>
requested that agencies generate cost and benefit estimates in 2016 dollars under Executive <br/>
Order 13771. If we were to represent wage estimates in 2017 dollars, then costs and benefits, <br/>
including net benefits, would increase by 4%. For our final rule, we will consider using 2017 and <br/>
even 2018 dollars, if available, for our cost and benefit estimates.  <br/>
We welcome comments on our methodology for estimating labor costs. <br/>

<i>Quantifying the Estimated Number of Health IT Developers and Products  </i><br/>
 <br/>
In this section, we describe the methodology used to assess the potential impact of new <br/>
2015 Edition certification criteria on the availability of certified products in the health IT market. <br/>
This analysis is based on the number of certified health IT products (i.e., Health IT Modules), <br/>
product capability, and the number of health IT developers that left, merged, and/or entered the <br/>
health IT market between the establishment of the Program and implementation of the 2011 <br/>
Edition and the implementation of the 2014 Edition.<a href="ONCs.html#533">150</a>  <br/>
 <br/>
Market consolidation may occur as a result of a natural evolvement of a new industry.<a href="ONCs.html#533">151</a> <br/>
We account for this factor in our analysis. In Table 7 below, we quantify the extent to which the <br/>
certified health IT market consolidated between the 2011 Edition and 2014 Edition. We found <br/>
that the number of health IT developers certifying products between the 2011 Edition and 2014 <br/>
Edition decreased by 22.1% and the number of products available decreased by 23.2%.  <br/>

Not all products are certified to all of the edition’s certification criteria available in the <br/>
Program. Modular certification allows a health IT developer to present a product for certification <br/>
to a narrower scope of specific use cases, which may be impacted at differing levels or may not <br/>
be impacted by the proposals in this proposed rule. Therefore, we have estimated the number of <br/>
2015 Edition certified health IT products and health IT developers impacted by each proposal <br/>
using proxies from historical data. Using the rates identified in Table 7, we then applied our <br/>
estimate for market consolidation to estimate the number 2015 Edition certified health IT <br/>
products and health IT developers that would be impacted by our policies in this proposed rule. <br/>
Specifically, to estimate the number of 2015 Edition products and health IT developers in the <br/>
market, we have assumed: <br/>
1.  <b>Products capable of recording EHI will include new certification criteria</b>. We assume <br/>
that products capable of recording patient health data will be the types of products most <br/>
likely to be impacted by and include the new proposed certification criteria. <br/>
2.  <b>Products capable of recording EHI data available in 2015 equal the number of products </b><br/>
<b>available in 2014</b>. In 2014, there were 710 products by 588 developers capable of recording <br/>
EHI. Since the new criteria involve the access to and movement and exchange of EHI, we <br/>
used only products that record EHI as a basis for our estimates. We believe the 2014 totals <br/>
reflect a realistic estimate of the currently available products and their developers that could <br/>
include the new 2015 certification criteria.  <br/>
3.  <b>Market consolidation rates denoted in Table 7 hold constant. </b>We assume that the rate of <br/>
market consolidation for products (-23.2%) and health IT developers (-22.1%) from the 2011 <br/>
Edition to the 2014 Edition holds constant for the 2015 Edition. <br/>

<i>Number of End Users that Might Be Impacted by ONC’s Proposed Regulations  </i><br/>
 <br/>
For the purpose of this analysis, the population of end users differs according to the <br/>
regulatory action proposed. In many cases, the end user population impacted is the number of <br/>
hospitals and health care providers that possess certified health IT. Due to data limitations, our <br/>
analysis regarding the number of hospitals and health care providers impacted by the regulatory <br/>
action is based on the number of hospitals and health care providers that have historically <br/>
participated in the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) EHR Incentive Programs. <br/>
Although there are limitations to this approach, participants in the CMS EHR Incentive Programs <br/>
represent an adequate sample on which to base our estimates.<a href="ONCs.html#535">152</a> We estimate 439,187 health care <br/>

(1) Deregulatory Actions <br/>
<i>Costs  </i><br/>
 <br/>
We do not expect costs to be associated with the deregulatory action proposals. <br/>
<i>Benefits </i><br/>
We expect the proposals for deregulatory actions to result in significant benefits for <br/>
health IT developers, providers, ONC-ACBs, ONC-ATLs, and ONC. These expected benefits <br/>
are detailed below. <br/>
<i>1.1 Removal of the Randomized Surveillance Minimum Threshold Requirements </i><br/>
<i> </i><br/>
We have proposed to revise § 170.556(c) by revising the requirement that ONC-ACBs <br/>
<i>must</i> conduct in-the-field, randomized surveillance and in its place specify that ONC-ACBs <i>may</i> <br/>
conduct in-the-field, randomized surveillance. We have further proposed to remove <br/>
§ 170.556(c)(2), which specifies that ONC-ACBs must conduct randomized surveillance for a <br/>
minimum of 2% of certified health IT products per year. We have also proposed to remove the <br/>
requirement that ONC-ACBs make a good faith effort to complete randomized surveillance and <br/>
the circumstances permitted for exclusion from this requirement found in § 170.556(c)(5). <br/>
 <br/>
These proposals would reduce burden on health care providers by reducing their exposure <br/>
to randomized in-the-field surveillance of their health IT products. Health care providers <br/>
expressed concern about the time commitment to support ONC-ACB randomized surveillance of <br/>
health IT products, particularly if no non-conformities with certified health IT were found. <br/>
Providers have generally stated that reactive surveillance (e.g., complaint-based surveillance) is a <br/>
more logical and economical approach to surveillance of health IT products implemented in a <br/>
health care setting. The proposal in this proposed rule would provide health IT developers more <br/>

 <br/>
time to focus on interoperability. It would also provide ONC-ACBs more time to respond to <br/>
reactive surveillance, including health care provider complaints about certified health IT. <br/>
In the 2015 Edition final rule, we did not independently estimate the costs for randomized <br/>
surveillance. Rather, we relied on prior regulatory cost estimates for all surveillance actions. One <br/>
of our ONC-ACBs charges a $3,000 annual fee per product for surveillance due to the new <br/>
randomized surveillance requirements and to help normalize their revenue stream during down <br/>
cycles between certification editions. Using this fee as a cost basis and assuming it would apply <br/>
to all certified health IT (as opposed to the market-adjusted universe of health IT that is used in <br/>
other calculations in this RIA), we estimate that our proposal to remove the randomized <br/>
surveillance “2% minimum threshold” requirements would result in cost savings between $6.8 <br/>
and $13.7 million for all stakeholders. To arrive at this estimate, we multiplied the $3000 annual <br/>
fee per product for surveillance by the total number of products certified to the 2014 Edition <br/>
which was 4,559 products at the time ($3,000*4,559=$13.7 million). We anticipate the number <br/>
of products certified for 2014 to decrease to a little as half of the original count over time. <br/>
Therefore, we estimated the low end to be half of the $13.7 million (.5*$13.7 million=$6.8 <br/>
million). This estimate is based on feedback we received from our ONC-ATL and ONC-ACB <br/>
stakeholders. ONC-ACBs performed randomized surveillance an average of 22 times the first <br/>
year the requirement was in effect. The following year surveillance was performed an average of <br/>
2 times. We cannot predict how many randomized surveillance events the ONC-ACBs will <br/>
perform now that we are not enforcing the requirement. It will be completely at the discretion of <br/>
the ONC-ACBs.   <br/>

 <br/>
We note that we considered other potential benefits that we were unable to quantify. We <br/>
considered that health care provider burden may decrease from the elimination of the 2% <br/>
minimum threshold requirements because a provider would previously aid the ONC-ACB in <br/>
software demonstrations. However, we acknowledge that in the long term and moving forward, <br/>
providers will likely be the party reporting more of the complaints that could result in reactive <br/>
surveillance. We also considered that an additional benefit of the proposal would be reduced <br/>
burden on ONC-ACBs. Feedback from ONC-ACBs indicates that having to meet a set number <br/>
of surveillance activities in 12 months can be quite burdensome, especially when factoring in the <br/>
active engagement necessary from provider participants. Last, we considered the potential <br/>
benefit to health IT developers in having more surveillance focused on situations dealing with <br/>
actual end-user concerns and/or difficulties. Health IT developers have indicated that they <br/>
benefit from such surveillance, as feedback about conformance and capability can improve their <br/>
products. <br/>
 <br/>
We welcome comments on potential means, methods, and relevant comparative studies <br/>
and data that we could use to better quantify these benefits.  <br/>
<i>1.2 Removal of the 2014 Edition from the Code of Federal Regulations </i><br/>
 <br/>
We have proposed to remove the 2014 Edition certification criteria from the Code of <br/>
Federal Regulations, which would directly benefit health IT developers, ONC-ACBs, ONC-<br/>
ATLs, and ONC and indirectly benefit health care providers. When looking at the cost savings <br/>
for removing the 2014 Edition certification criteria, we considered the current costs for <br/>
maintaining those certifications and their surveillance (reactive), as well as the maintenance and <br/>
administrative costs associated with supporting customer use of certified health IT for CMS EHR <br/>

Incentive Program participation. The estimates below consider ONC analysis of the financial <br/>
sustainability of ONC-ACBs and reflect data from as late as 2015. <br/>
We estimate that health IT developers would realize monetary savings from no longer <br/>
supporting the 2014 Edition certification criteria due to a reduction in activities related to <br/>
maintaining certification and surveillance. We are aware that one of our ONC-ACBs charges an <br/>
inherited certified status (ICS) fee of $1,000. This fee has been applied over the last calendar <br/>
year. Over that time period, the number of new, unique 2014 Edition products has been declining <br/>
(24 products in the last calendar year, and no new products in the last four months) compared to <br/>
the number of ICS certifications (569). Just assuming the cost of continued ICS certification, <br/>
health IT developers would be paying approximately $569,000 each year to keep their 2014 <br/>
Edition products up-to-date. <br/>
We are not aware of comparable fees charged by ONC-ATLs; however, based on our <br/>
experience with the Program, we expect health IT developers would realize similar cost savings <br/>
associated with ONC-ATL maintenance of the testing component associated with ICS. Thus, we <br/>
estimate an additional $569,000 cost savings for health IT developers due to the reduced testing <br/>
requirements. <br/>
 <br/>
A recent study conducted by ONC indicates that 2014 Edition ICS certification is not <br/>
profitable for ONC-ACBs, which is why one ONC-ACB charged an additional $3,000 annual fee <br/>
per product for surveillance for 2015 Edition certifications. In 2015, the net income for ONC-<br/>
ACBs dropped 99% from about $5,310,000 in 2014 to $67,000 due to a decline in revenue from <br/>
a drop in new 2014 Edition certified health IT products without a significant drop in expenses. <br/>
We do not have enough information to calculate what percentage of ONC-ACB expenses are the <br/>

direct result of 2014 Edition certification maintenance; however, our research indicates that it is <br/>
significantly less profitable for ONC-ACBs to maintain 2014 Edition certification criteria (e.g., <br/>
through ICS attestation and reactive surveillance) than to certify new 2014 Edition certified <br/>
health IT products.  <br/>
 <br/>
We also attempted to identify a potential reduction in maintenance and administrative <br/>
costs as a result of removing 2014 Edition certification criteria. We could not obtain data to <br/>
conduct a full quantitative analysis specific to the reduction of health IT developer and health <br/>
care provider costs related to supporting and maintaining the 2014 Edition. We seek comment on <br/>
methods to quantify potential costs for maintaining and supporting products to previous editions. <br/>
 <br/>
We did conduct a review of academic literature and qualitative analysis regarding <br/>
potential savings from no longer supporting the 2014 Edition. We looked at data in IT industry <br/>
systems as whole, which showed that upgrading outdated legacy systems saves resources <br/>
otherwise spent on maintaining compatibilities to multiple systems and also increases quality and <br/>
efficiency.<a href="ONCs.html#540">156 </a>Furthermore, as technology evolves, newer software and products allow for <br/>
smoother updates compared to their predecessors. Newer products provide better security <br/>
features that are able to address both new and existing issues. In addition, older software has an <br/>
increased risk of failure, which, in the health IT industry, increases risk to patient safety.  <br/>

From the implementer’s perspective, the research indicates that retaining legacy systems <br/>
tends to inhibit scalability and growth for businesses. The perpetuity of outdated legacy systems <br/>

efficiency through IT implementation. Newer products are developed to current specifications <br/>
and updated standards, which decreases barriers and marginal cost of ancillary product <br/>
implementation and increases the accessibility of data in ancillary systems – including via <br/>
mobile devices and the latest applications. Finally, office staff in a health care setting would no <br/>

integrate to the legacy product.<a href="ONCs.html#541">157</a> <br/>
The research also indicates that retaining legacy software would not be beneficial or <br/>
profitable to the health IT market. Prolonging backwards compatibility of newer products to <br/>
legacy systems encourages market fragmentation.<a href="ONCs.html#541">158</a> Limiting fragmentation encourages <br/>
innovation and attracts more developers by reducing barriers and the marginal cost of <br/>
development to multiple platforms. Health IT stakeholders have expressed that system <br/>
fragmentation increases the cost to develop and maintain health IT connectivity for data <br/>
exchange and to integrate software supporting administrative and clinical processes, as well as <br/>
limiting the feasibility of developing products to support specialty clinical care. This direct <br/>
feedback suggests that fragmentation is having a negative impact on the interoperability and <br/>
usability of health IT systems for health care providers. We intend to encourage the health IT <br/>
market to keep progressing with a baseline expectation of functionalities that evolve over time. <br/>

We also estimate that additional savings could be realized by reducing regulatory <br/>
complexity and burden caused by having two certification editions. For example, in the 2015 <br/>
Edition final rule, we added new requirements, such as disclosure and transparency <br/>
requirements, that applied to all certified product editions. This required significant effort by <br/>
health IT developers and ONC-ACBs to execute the requirements, and both groups found it <br/>
challenging to complete the task in the original timeframe provided by ONC. We have observed <br/>
that the task of managing two different editions within different rules increases complexity and <br/>
burden for ONC staff, contractors, ONC-ACBs, CMS programs referencing the certification <br/>
criteria, and other stakeholders, as compared to our proposal to remove the 2014 Edition <br/>
certification criteria. However, we are unable to estimate these benefits because we have no <br/>
means for quantifying the benefits gained from only using the 2015 Edition. We welcome <br/>
comments on potential means, methods, and relevant comparative studies and data that we could <br/>
use to quantify these benefits.  <br/>
 <br/>
We also expect that health care providers would benefit from this proposal because such <br/>
action would likely motivate health IT developers to certify health IT products to the 2015 <br/>
Edition, thus enabling providers to use the most up-to-date and supported systems to care for <br/>
patients. The 2015 Edition certification criteria facilitates greater interoperability for several <br/>
clinical health information purposes and enables health information exchange, including APIs, <br/>
through new and enhanced certification criteria, standards, and implementation specifications. The <br/>
certification criteria also allow for updates to documents and data standards and focus on the <br/>
establishment of an interoperable health information infrastructure. We welcome comments on <br/>

<i>1.3</i> <i>Removal of the ONC-Approved Accreditor from the ONC Health IT Certification </i><br/>
<i> </i><br/>
<i>Program </i><br/>
 <br/>
We expect ONC to realize monetary cost savings from the proposal to remove the ONC-<br/>
Approved Accreditor (ONC-AA) from the Program. We expect ONC to realize costs savings <br/>
from no longer: (1) developing and publishing a Federal Register Notice and listserv; (2) <br/>
monitoring the open application period and reviewing and making decisions regarding <br/>
applications; and (3) oversight and enforcement of the ONC-AA. We have calculated the <br/>
estimated annual cost savings for this proposal, taking into consideration that the ONC-AA <br/>
renewed its status every three years. <br/>
 <br/>
The ONC-AA’s expertise is in the ISO/IEC 17065 standard. Therefore, to effectively <br/>
collaborate with the ONC-AA for Program activities, ONC allocates resources for working with <br/>
the ONC-AA and informing the ONC-AA of scheme requirements and applicable policy <br/>
interpretations, which we have and can provide directly to the ONC-ACBs. The amount of ONC <br/>
resources allocated depends on current Program activities and need. For our calculations, we <br/>
used the estimated hours for collaborating with and informing an ONC-AA in 2017 (using 2016 <br/>
wage estimates). We estimate that ONC spent approximately 110 hours collaborating with the <br/>
ONC-AA in 2017, which includes (all at the GS-13, Step 1 level): annual assessments; providing <br/>
appropriate guidance; implementing new requirements and initiatives; and consultations as <br/>
necessary. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, <br/>
DC is approximately $88.30. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost savings to be $3,238. <br/>

 <br/>
We estimate that ONC would commit approximately eight hours of staff time to develop <br/>
the Federal Register Notice, which would include approximately: four hours for drafting and <br/>
review by an analyst at the GS-13, Step 1 level; two hours for review and analysis by senior <br/>
certification staff at the GS-14, Step 1 level; and two hours for review and submittal for <br/>
publication by Immediate Office staff at the GS-15, Step 1 level. The hourly wage with benefits <br/>
for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately $88.30. The hourly <br/>
wage with benefits for a GS-14, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately <br/>
$104.34. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-15, Step 1 employee located in Washington, <br/>
DC is approximately $122.74. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost savings to be $269. <br/>
Additionally, we estimate a cost of $477 to publish each page in the Federal Register, which <br/>
includes operational costs. The Federal Register Notice for ONC-AAs requires, on average, one <br/>
page in the Federal Register (every three years), so we estimate an additional annual cost savings <br/>
of $159.   <br/>
 <br/>
We estimate that ONC would commit approximately two hours of staff time by an <br/>
analyst at the GS-13, Step 1 level to draft, review, and publish the listserv to announce the <br/>
Federal Register Notice. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in <br/>
Washington, DC is approximately $88.30. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost savings to be <br/>
$59. <br/>
 <br/>
We estimate that ONC would commit approximately 25 hours of staff time to manage the <br/>
open application process, review applications and reach application decisions, which would <br/>
include approximately: 20 hours by an analyst at the GS-13, Step 1 level; three hours by senior <br/>
certification staff at the GS-14, Step 1 level; and two hours for review and approval by <br/>

hourly wage with benefits for a GS-15, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is <br/>
approximately $122.74. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost savings to be $775. <br/>
 <br/>
Taking all of these potential costs savings into consideration, we estimate the overall <br/>
annual costs savings for our proposal to remove the ONC-AA from the Program to be $4,500.  <br/>
<i>1.4 Removal of Certain 2015 Edition Certification Criteria </i><br/>
 <br/>
In section III.B.4 of this proposed rule, we propose to remove the following certification <br/>
criteria from the 2015 Edition: § 170.315(b)(4) “Common Clinical Data Set summary - create;” <br/>
(b)(5) “Common Clinical Data Set summary – receive”, § 170.315(a)(10) “Drug formulary and <br/>
preferred drug list checks,” § 170.315(a)(11) “Smoking status,”§ 170.315(a)(13) “Patient-<br/>
specific education resources” and § 170.315(e)(2) “Secure messaging.” <br/>
For determining calculations for the majority of the proposed removal of certain 2015 <br/>
Edition certification criteria, we used the assumptions below. For the proposed removal of § <br/>
170.315(b)(4) Common Clinical Data Set summary – create and (b)(5) Common Clinical Data <br/>
Set summary – receive, we took a slightly different approach discussed in section 1.4.1. <br/>
 <br/>
In the 2015 Edition final rule, we estimated the costs for developing and preparing health <br/>
IT to meet the 2015 Edition certification criteria. The development and preparation costs we <br/>
estimated were derived through a health IT developer per criterion cost. We estimated the <br/>
development and preparation costs over a four-year period and we projected the costs would be <br/>
unevenly distributed. In figuring out the cost savings for the deregulatory actions, we initially <br/>

used the distribution from the 2015 Edition, but then adjusted the percentages of development <br/>
and preparation costs due to current empirical and anecdotal evidence. The distribution was <br/>
reevaluated to account for 2019 and we estimate the actual development and preparation <br/>
distribution for 2018 to be 35% and for 2019 to be 15%. We took the average development and <br/>
preparation cost estimates (low and high) per criterion from Table 14 of the 2015 Edition final <br/>
rule (80 FR 62737). We then used our new distribution to figure out the cost per year for years <br/>
2018 and 2019. We took the total estimated costs for 2018 and 2019 and divided that by 12 to <br/>
determine the cost savings per month and took a range of 6-12 months. <br/>
 <br/>
To determine the testing costs of the deregulatory actions, we took the number of health <br/>
IT developers who develop products for certification for the identified criteria from the 2015 <br/>
Edition final rule and then figured out the average cost per criterion. Based on the costs that one <br/>
of the ONC-ATLs charges for testing, we estimated the average cost for testing per criterion and <br/>
determined subsequent cost savings. In 2017, only about five to ten percent of products have <br/>
been tested and certified compared to the number of certified 2014 Edition products. Therefore, <br/>
up to 90 to 95 percent of products remain to be tested and certified to the 2015 Edition.  <br/>
 <br/>
We estimate the total cost savings by multiplying the number of health IT developers <br/>
who developed products for certification to a certain criterion by the estimated cost per criterion, <br/>
$475. We then took five percent of that number to figure out the high end for the cost savings. <br/>
We then took 10 percent to figure out the low end. The five percent was derived from looking at <br/>
the number of unique developers who have at least one active 2014 Edition product and the <br/>
number of unique developers who have at least one active 2015 Edition. The denominator is the <br/>
number of unique developers who have at least one active 2014 Edition product, which is 793. <br/>

The numerator is the number of unique developers who have at least one active 2015 Edition <br/>
product and one active 2014 edition product, which is 41. (41/793=0.0517024 or 5 percent).  <br/>
<i>1.4.1 Common Clinical Data Set Summary Record Criteria  </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose to remove the Common Clinical Data Set summary - create (§ <br/>
170.315(b)(4)) and Common Clinical Data Set summary - receive (§ 170.315 (b)(5)) criteria.  <br/>
 <br/>
We expect ONC to realize cost savings associated with internal infrastructure support and <br/>
maintenance, which would include actions such as (1) developing and maintaining information <br/>
regarding these criteria on the ONC website; (2) creating documents related to these criteria and <br/>
making those documents 508 compliant; (3) updating, revising, and supporting Certification <br/>
Companion Guides, test procedures, and test tools; and (4) responding to inquiries concerning <br/>
these criteria. Based on ONC data on the number of inquiries received since early 2016, we <br/>
estimate approximately 12 annual inquiries about § 170.315(b)(4) and (5) respectively, (24 total <br/>
inquiries for two criteria). We estimate it will take an analyst at the GS-13, Step 1 level an <br/>
average of two hours to conduct all tasks associated with each inquiry. The hourly wage with <br/>
benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately $88.30. <br/>
Therefore, we estimate the annual cost savings to be $4,238.  <br/>
 <br/>
We do not expect cost savings associated with software maintenance because both of <br/>
these criteria incorporate the Common Clinical Data Set and essentially the same data input and <br/>
validation requirements as the transitions of care criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)). The removal of <br/>
these two criteria would not affect the test data and software maintenance costs, as the same test <br/>
data and software validation elements remain in § 170.315(b)(1) and the Common Clinical Data <br/>
Set used in other criteria.   <br/>

ONC-ACBs could realize minimal savings, as they would need to conduct slightly less <br/>
surveillance based on the two products that are currently certified to these criteria. We expect <br/>
these potential cost savings to be de minimis and have therefore not estimated them.  <br/>
 <br/>
Taking all these potential costs savings into consideration, we estimate the overall annual <br/>
costs savings for our proposal to remove the Common Clinical Data Set summary record <br/>
certification criteria from the 2015 Edition to be $4,238. We welcome comments on the above <br/>
estimates and methods we could use to better quantify these benefits. <br/>

 <br/>
<i>1.4.2 Drug Formulary and Preferred Drug List Checks </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “drug formulary and preferred drug list checks” <br/>
criterion in § 170.315(a)(10)). To calculate the cost savings for removing this criterion, we used <br/>
the 2015 Edition estimated costs for development and preparation for this criterion which were <br/>
between $15,750 and $31,500. We believe that 35% of developers would be still newly <br/>
certifying in 2018 and 15% in 2019 and applied the proportions respectively. We estimated the <br/>
cost of development and preparation costs to be between $5,512.50 and $11,025 for 2018 and <br/>
$2,362.50 and $4,725 for 2019. We calculated the cost per month for years 2018 and 2019 and <br/>
using the high point estimates, estimated the development and preparation costs over a 6 to 12 <br/>
month period between August 2018 to August 2019 to be between $4,068.75 and $6,825.  <br/>
 <br/>
To calculate the cost for testing for this criterion, we multiplied the 5 developers that we <br/>
estimated in the 2015 Edition to develop products to this criterion by our estimated cost to test <br/>
per criterion of $475. The estimated cost per criterion was based on what one ONC-ATL charged <br/>
for testing and averaged per criterion. To be conservative in our calculations, we reduced the <br/>
number by 10% and 5% respectively resulting in $2,137.50 and $2,256.25.  <br/>

<i>1.4.3 Smoking Status </i><br/>
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “smoking status” criterion (§ 170.315(a)(11)), <br/>
which would include removing it from the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition. To calculate the <br/>
cost savings for removing this criterion, we used the 2015 Edition estimated costs of developing <br/>
and preparing the criterion to the 2015 Edition, between $15,750 and $31,500 and estimated that <br/>
35% of developers would be newly certified in 2018 and 15% in 2019. We estimated the cost of <br/>
development and preparation costs to be between $5,512.50 and $11,025 for 2018 and $2,362.50 <br/>
and $4,725 for 2019. We calculated the cost per month for years 2018 and 2019 and using the <br/>
high point estimates, estimated the development and preparation costs over a 6 to 12 month <br/>
period between August 2018 and August 2019. We estimated the costs to be between $4,068.75 <br/>
at 6 months and $6,825 at 12 months. <br/>
To calculate the cost for testing for this criterion, 5 developers were estimated in the 2015 <br/>
Edition to develop products to this criterion. We multiplied the 5 developers by our estimated <br/>
cost to test per criterion of $475. This estimated cost per criterion was based on what one ONC-<br/>
ATL charged for testing and averaged per criterion. To be conservative, we reduced the number <br/>

We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “patient-specific education resources” <br/>
certification criterion (§ 170.315(a)(13)). To estimate the cost of removing this criterion, we used <br/>
the 2015 Edition estimated costs for development and preparation which is between $4,709,880 <br/>
and $6,279,840. We believe that 35% of developers would be still newly certifying in 2018 and <br/>
15% in 2019 and applied the proportions respectively. We estimated the cost of development and <br/>
preparation to be between $1,648,458 and $2,197,944 for 2018 and $706,482 and $941,976 for <br/>
2019. We calculated the cost per month for years 2018 and 2019 and using the high point <br/>
estimates, estimated the development and preparation costs over a 6 to 12 month period, within <br/>
August 2018 to August 2019. We estimated the costs to be between $850,395 at 6 months and <br/>
$1,360,632 at 12 months. To calculate the testing cost for this criterion, we multiplied the <br/>
estimates from the 2015 Edition of 249 developers that we estimated would develop products to <br/>
this criterion by our estimated cost to test per criterion of $475. The estimated cost per criterion <br/>
was based on what one ONC-ATL charged for testing and averaged per criterion. To be <br/>
conservative, we reduced the number by 10% and 5% respectively resulting in $106,447.50 and <br/>
$112,361.25. Taking these estimated costs into account, we expect the cost savings of removing <br/>
the 2015 Edition “Patient-specific education resources” criterion to be between $1,467,079.50 <br/>

We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “secure messaging” criterion (§ 170.315(e)(2)). <br/>
To estimate the cost savings of removing this criterion, we used the estimates from the 2015 <br/>

preparation costs to be between $543,312 and $1,086,624 for 2018 and $232,848 and $465,696 <br/>
for 2019. We then calculated the cost per month for years 2018 and 2019 and using the high <br/>

between August 2018 to August 2019 to be between $401,016 at 6 months and $672,672 at 12 <br/>

estimated in the 2015 Edition would develop products to this criterion by our estimated cost to <br/>
test per criterion of $475. The estimated cost per criterion was based on what one ONC-ATL <br/>
charged for testing and averaged per criterion. To be conservative, we reduced the number by <br/>
10% and 5%, respectively, resulting in $105,165 and $111,007.50.  Taking these estimated costs <br/>
into account, we estimate the cost savings of removing the 2015 Edition “Secure messaging” <br/>
criterion to be between $777,837 and $783,678.50. <br/>

<i>1.5 Removal of Certain Certification Requirements</i>  <br/>
We propose to remove § 170.523(k)(1)(iii)(B), which requires ONC-ACBs to ensure that <br/>
certified health IT includes a detailed description of all known material information concerning <br/>
limitations that a user may encounter in the course of implementing and using the certified health <br/>
IT, whether to meet “meaningful use” objectives and measures or to achieve any other use within <br/>
the scope of the health IT's certification. We also propose to remove § 170.523(k)(1)(iv)(B) and <br/>
(C), which state that the types of information required to be disclosed include but are not limited <br/>
to: (B) limitations, whether by contract or otherwise, on the use of any capability to which <br/>
technology is certified for any purpose within the scope of the technology's certification; or in <br/>
connection with any data generated in the course of using any capability to which health IT is <br/>

technology or its capabilities, that could prevent or impair the successful implementation, <br/>
configuration, customization, maintenance, support, or use of any capabilities to which <br/>
technology is certified; or that could prevent or limit the use, exchange, or portability of any data <br/>
generated in the course of using any capability to which technology is certified.  <br/>
To calculate the savings related to removing these two disclosure requirements, we <br/>
estimated 830 products certified to the 2015 Edition. We did so by applying the market <br/>
consolidation rate of -23.2% which was the rate observed between 2011 and 2014 Editions. <br/>
Assuming that an ONC-ACB spends 1 hour on average reviewing costs, limitations and <br/>
mandatory disclosures, we estimate the time saved by no longer having to review the limitations <br/>
to be two-thirds of an hour. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located <br/>
in Washington, DC is approximately $88.30 and we assume this to be the hourly rate for an <br/>
ONC-ACB reviewer. We multiplied 830, the projected number of certified products, by two-<br/>
thirds of an hour and the assumed hourly rate and calculated the cost savings to be $48,859. <br/>
(2) Updates to the 2015 Edition Certification Criteria <br/>
 <br/>
The following section details the costs and benefits for updates to the 2015 Edition health <br/>
IT certification criteria, which includes (1) costs and benefits to update certain 2015 Edition <br/>
criteria to due to the adoption of the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) as a <br/>
standard and (2) costs for new 2015 Edition criteria for electronic health information export, <br/>
API, privacy and security, and Data Segmentation for Privacy (DS4P)-Send and Data <br/>
Segmentation for Privacy-Receive, and consent management for APIs.  <br/>

 <br/>
In order to advance interoperability by ensuring compliance with new structured data and <br/>
code sets that support the data, we propose in this proposed rule to remove the “Common <br/>
Clinical Data Set” definition and its references from the 2015 Edition and replace it with the <br/>
“United States Core Data for Interoperability” (USCDI) standard, naming Version 1 (v1) in § <br/>
170.213 and incorporating it by reference in §170.299. The USCDI v1 establishes a minimum set <br/>
of data classes (including structured data) that are required for health IT to be interoperable <br/>
nationwide and is designed to be expanded in an iterative and predictable way over time.   <br/>
The USCDI v1 adds 2 new data classes, “Clinical Notes” and “Provenance” that were not <br/>
defined in the CCDS, which will require updates to the Consolidated Clinical Document <br/>
Architecture (C-CDA) standard and updates to the following certification criteria: § <br/>
170.315(b)(1) (transitions of care); (e)(1) (view, download, and transmit to 3rd party); (g)(6) <br/>
(Consolidated CDA creation performance); (f)(5) (transmission to public health agencies – <br/>
electronic case reporting); and (g)(9) (application access – all data request). From our analysis of <br/>
the C-CDA standard, we conclude that the requirements of “Provenance” data class are already <br/>
met by the existing C-CDA standard, and will not require any new development. Therefore, we <br/>
have estimated the proposed cost to health IT developers to add support for “Clinical Notes” data <br/>
class in C-CDA, and the necessary updates to the affected certification criteria. These estimates <br/>
are detailed in Table 9 below and are based on the following assumptions: <br/>
1.  <b>Health IT developers will use the same labor costs and data models</b>. Table 9 shows the <br/>
estimated labor costs per product for a health IT developer to develop support for the <br/>
additional USCDI data element in the C-CDA standard and affected certification criteria. We <br/>

products, we estimate that the total annual cost to all health IT developers would, on average, <br/>
range from $103.8 million to $262.3 million. This would be a one-time cost to developers per <br/>
product that is certified to the specified certification criteria and would not be perpetual. <br/>

We believe this proposal would benefit health care providers, patients, and the industry as <br/>
a whole. Clinical notes and provenance were included in the draft USCDI v1 based on significant <br/>
feedback from the industry, which highly regarded their desirability as part of interoperable <br/>
exchanges. The free text portion of the clinical notes was most often relayed by clinicians as the <br/>
data they sought, but were often missing during electronic health information exchange. <br/>
Similarly, the provenance of data was also referenced by stakeholders as a fundamental need to <br/>
improve the trustworthiness and reliability of the data being exchanged. We expect <br/>
improvements to interoperable exchange of information and data provenance to significantly <br/>
benefit providers and patients. However, we are not aware of an approach for quantifying these <br/>
benefits and welcome comments on potential approaches to quantifying these benefits. <br/>
<i>2.2 Electronic Health Information Export </i><br/>
 <br/>
We have proposed a new 2015 Edition certification criterion for “electronic health <br/>
information export” in <b>§ </b>170.315(b)(10). The intent of this criterion is to provide patients and <br/>

patients in a computable, electronic format. Further, it would facilitate the receiving health IT <br/>
system’s interpretation and use of the EHI to the extent reasonably practicable using the health <br/>

electronic health information. It would also facilitate health care providers’ ability to switch <br/>
health IT systems or migrate electronic health information for use in other technologies. This <br/>
proposed criterion supports two specific use cases. First, it supports the export for a single <br/>

<i>Costs </i><br/>
 <br/>
This section describes the estimated costs of the “electronic health information export” <br/>
certification criterion. The cost estimates are based on the following assumptions: <br/>
1.  <b>Health IT developers will use the same labor costs and data models</b>. Table 10 shows the <br/>
estimated labor costs per product for a health IT developer to develop and maintain the <br/>
electronic health information export functionality. We recognize that health IT developer <br/>
costs will vary; however, our estimates in this section assume all health IT developers will <br/>
incur the costs noted in Table 10.  <br/>
2.  <b>A proxy is needed to project the number of 2015 Edition certified health IT products </b><br/>
<b>containing the “electronic health information export” certification criterion</b>.<b> </b>We <br/>
estimate that 545 products from 458 developers will contain the “electronic health <br/>
information export” criterion. To develop these estimates we first identified a proxy for the <br/>
number of health IT developers that may create a 2015 Edition certified health IT product <br/>
containing the “electronic health information export” criterion. Our proxy is based on the <br/>
number of 2014 Edition certified health IT products that are capable of recording patient <br/>
data.<a href="ONCs.html#557">162 </a>We based our estimates on these products because data must be captured to be <br/>
exported under the proposed criterion. There were 710 products by 588 developers with at <br/>
least one 2014 Edition product capable of recording patient data. We then multiplied these <br/>
                                                 <br/>
162 We defined “products capable of recording patient data” as any 2014 Edition product that was certified for at <br/>least one of the following criteria: Demographics ((a)(5)), Medication List ((a)(7)), Medication Allergy List ((a)(8)), <br/>Problem List ((a)(6)), and Family Health History ((a)(12)). <br/>

Based on the stated assumptions and costs outlined in Table 10, the total estimated cost <br/>
for health IT developers to develop products to the electronic health information export <br/>
certification criterion will range from $17.5 million to $174.9 million. Assuming 458 health IT <br/>
developers, there would be an average cost per health IT developer ranging from $38,185 to <br/>
$381,852. The midpoint of ranges stated is used as the primary estimate of costs and benefits. <br/>
We note that the development costs, which equal half of the total, would be a one-time cost and <br/>
would not be perpetual. <br/>

There are a number of benefits to the electronic health information export functionality. <br/>
In our analysis, we have calculated the benefits in terms of the reduced costs of the electronic <br/>
health information export functionality compared to performing data export without the <br/>
electronic health information export functionality. The benefit calculations below are based on <br/>
the following assumptions:<b> </b><br/>
1.  <b>On average, 5% of providers and hospitals switch their health IT annually</b>. Using CMS <br/>
Medicare EHR Incentive Program data from years 2013-2016, we estimate the rate of <br/>
providers (hospitals and eligible professionals) that changed their health IT developer. We <br/>
believe that the electronic health information export functionality would help alleviate the <br/>
burden of switching between health IT systems by making data more portable. Thus, the <br/>
benefit calculations are based on assumptions regarding the number of clinical practices (n = <br/>
4,774) and hospitals (n = 226) that are projected to switch products in a year. <br/>
2.  <b>Health IT consultants<a href="ONCs.html#560">164</a></b><b> will use the same labor costs and data models</b>. Table 13 shows <br/>
the estimated labor costs per product for a hospital or health care provider to hire a health IT <br/>
consultant to perform data export without the electronic health information export <br/>
functionality. We recognize that these costs will vary based on the size of the hospital or <br/>
clinical practice. <br/>

We multiplied the costs to switch health IT by the estimated number of hospitals and <br/>
clinical practices affected. Thus the estimated annual benefit, in terms of cost savings to hospitals <br/>
and clinical practices would range from $240.7 million to $2.4 billion. If we assume, based on <br/>
our upper bound estimates above, that the total cost to health IT developers is $174.9 million and <br/>
that increased developer costs are passed to customers, then the net benefit to hospitals and <br/>
clinical practices would range from $65.8 million to $2.2 billion. The midpoint of ranges stated <br/>
is used as the primary estimate of costs and benefits. <br/>
<i>2.3 Application Programming Interfaces  </i><br/>
 <br/>
Our proposals regarding APIs in this proposed rule reflect the full depth and scope of <br/>
what we believe is necessary to implement the API Condition of Certification. We propose to <br/>
include new standards, new implementation specifications, and a new certification criterion. Our <br/>
proposal also includes a detailed Condition of Certification and associated Maintenance of <br/>
Certification requirements, as well as a proposal to modify the Base EHR definition.  <br/>
<i>Costs </i><br/>
 <br/>
This section describes the potential costs of the API certification criterion. The cost <br/>
estimates below are based on the following assumptions: <br/>
1.  <b>Health IT developers will use the same labor costs and data models</b>. Table 16 shows the <br/>
estimated labor costs per product for a health IT developer to develop and maintain an API. <br/>
We recognize that health IT developer costs will vary; however, we have assumed in our <br/>
calculations that all health IT developers will incur the costs noted in Table 16.  <br/>

2.  <b>A proxy is needed to project number of 2015 Edition certified health IT products </b><br/>
<b>containing the API certification criterion. </b>We estimate that 459 products from 394 <br/>
developers will contain the API criterion. We used a proxy to determine the number of health <br/>
IT developers that may develop an API for the certification to the 2015 edition. There were <br/>
598 products and 506 developers with at least one 2014 Edition certified health IT product <br/>
that could perform transitions of care. We then multiplied this number by our certified health <br/>
IT market consolidation estimates of -22.1% and -23.2% to project the number of 2015 <br/>
developers and products, respectively. We believe this estimate serves as a reasonable proxy <br/>
for products capability of sending patient data. The 2015 Edition required API functionality <br/>
achieves a similar end by allowing providers to retrieve patient data from secure data servers <br/>
hosted by other developers, as well as providing patients access to their medical records <br/>
through third-party applications connected to these same secure servers. <br/>

Based on the stated assumptions and costs outlined in Table 18, the total estimated costs <br/>
for health IT developers to develop and maintain a product to the API criterion would range from <br/>
$181.7 million to $414.0 million with an average cost per developer ranging from $461,228 to <br/>
$1,050,656. We note that the “other costs,” which account for $2.1 million to $10.7 million of <br/>
this total are one-time costs and are not perpetual. The midpoint of ranges stated is used as the <br/>
primary estimate of costs and benefits. <br/>

The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) tasks ONC with <br/>
measuring interoperability in the health IT industry.<a href="ONCs.html#566">167 </a>The measurement concepts developed <br/>
include a multi-part approach analyzing not only adoption of health IT functionalities supporting <br/>
information exchange but the downstream impact of these technologies on data completeness, <br/>
data integration, and supports for core functions of patient care. The benefits of our API proposal <br/>
are similarly multifaceted. In the analysis below, we quantify benefits in the following three <br/>
areas:<i> </i><br/>
•  Reduction in provider burden associated with locating patient data;  <br/>
•  Reduced costs related to reductions in duplicate lab tests, readmissions, emergency room <br/>
(ER) visits, and adverse drug events due to increased interoperability. We focused on these <br/>
outcomes for two reasons: (i) evidence in literature indicates that health information <br/>
exchange impacts the chosen measures; and (ii) cost of care associated with these measures is <br/>

high and the impact of health information exchange is likely to result in significant benefits <br/>
in the form of cost reduction. <br/>
•  Increase in the number of individuals with access to their health information.  <br/>
The benefit calculations are based on the following assumptions:  <br/>
1.  <b>Benefits noted in academic literature are assumed accurate</b>. Estimates of the benefits are <br/>
based on estimates obtained from peer reviewed academic literature. ONC reviewed <br/>
academic articles for validity; however, models were not replicated.   <br/>
2.  <b>Hospitals and eligible professionals that have participated in the CMS EHR Incentive </b><br/>
<b>Programs will be impacted</b>: Estimates are based on the assumption that 439,187 health care <br/>
providers and/or 4,519 hospitals would be affected by this regulatory action.  <br/>
3.  <b>Estimates on the impact of APIs on rates of interoperability (1% to 4%) are based on </b><br/>
<b>ONC analysis</b>. To identify the impact of the API proposal on interoperability, we used <br/>
regression analysis. Specifically, we estimated linear probability models that identified the <br/>
impact of 2014 Edition certified EHR on hospitals’ interoperability (whether a hospital <br/>
sends, receives, finds, and integrates summary of care records). Using data from the <br/>
American Hospital Association (AHA) from years 2014 to 2015 in the model, we controlled <br/>
for hospital size, profit status, participation in a health information organization, and state <br/>
and year fixed effects. The marginal effect of using a 2014 Edition certified health IT equated <br/>
to a 5% increase in interoperability. This is an upper bound estimate. For the purpose of this <br/>
analysis, we assume that one to four percentage points would be a reasonable range for API’s <br/>
marginal impact on interoperability.  <br/>

As noted previously, there might be shared benefits across certain proposals and we have <br/>
taken steps to ensure that the benefits attributed to each proposal are unique to the proposal <br/>
referenced. Specifically, we used regression analysis to calculate the impact of our real world <br/>
testing and API proposals on interoperability. We assumed that the collective impact of real <br/>
world testing and API proposals on interoperability would not exceed the impact of 2014 Edition <br/>
certified health IT. Therefore, we estimated linear probability models that identified the impact <br/>
of 2014 Edition certified health IT on hospitals’ interoperability.<a href="ONCs.html#568">168</a> We controlled for additional <br/>
factors such as participation in a health information exchange organization, hospital <br/>
characteristics, and urban/rural status. We found the marginal effect of using 2014 Edition <br/>
certified health IT was a five percentage point increase in interoperability. <br/>
 <br/>
While we acknowledge that there might be shared benefits across proposals, we have <br/>
taken steps to ensure that the benefits attributed to each proposal is unique to the proposal <br/>
referenced. We assumed that this marginal effect is true for our proposals and distributed the 5% <br/>
benefit across our real world testing and API proposals at (.1-1%) to (1-4%) respectively. <br/>
Moreover, the number of providers impacted is proposal specific. Given data limitations, we <br/>
believe this approach allows us to estimate the benefits of our proposals without double counting <br/>
the impact each proposal might have on interoperability.  <br/>
 <br/>
The first table below shows benefits of APIs for providers where we monetize the impact <br/>
of APIs as total amount saved by reducing provider time spent with the health IT. Sinsky et al <br/>
found physicians spend 27% of their total time on direct clinical face time with patients, and <br/>

49.2% of their time on EHR and desk work.<a href="ONCs.html#569">169</a> Outside office hours, physicians spend another 1 <br/>
to 2 hours of personal time each night doing additional computer and other clerical work. Based <br/>
on this study, we assume that providers spend, on average, 6 hours per day with their EHR (4 <br/>
hours of an 8 hour work day and 2 hours outside of office hours). Despite the number of hours <br/>
providers spend in their EHR, there is evidence that the introduction of EHRs is associated with <br/>
time saved. Amusan et al found that EHR and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) <br/>
implementation was associated with 3.69 minutes of time saved five months post <br/>
implementation.<a href="ONCs.html#569">170 </a>Additionally, Adler-Milstein et al found that an increase in EHR use resulted <br/>
in a 5.3% increase in work relative value units per clinician work day.<a href="ONCs.html#569">171</a> Using this evidence, we <br/>
estimate the potential impact of APIs on providers’ time ranges from 1% - 5%.<a href="ONCs.html#569">172</a>  <br/>
Because the benefit of time saved is not limited to interoperable exchange of health information <br/>
among providers but includes additional benefits such as increased patient knowledge, we used <br/>
evidence from the literature to calculate the time saved benefit. Thus, the impact of APIs on <br/>
provider time is expected to represent a larger impact (5%) than the impact of APIs on health <br/>
outcomes (1%-4%) and cost. This is primarily because provider behavior is more directly <br/>
affected by this improvement.      <br/>

Assuming 6 hours (or 360 minutes) per day, this amounts to approximately 1% of time saved. The upper <br/>bound estimate of 5% leverages Adler-Milstein’s estimate of a 5.3% estimate (rounded to 5%). <br/>

Based on the above calculations, we estimate the annual benefit to health care providers <br/>
for the use of the proposed API capabilities would, on average, range from $651 million to $3.3 <br/>
billion. We estimate the annual benefit for patients and payers would, on average, range from <br/>
$278 million to million to $1.1 billion. Therefore, we estimate the total annual benefit of APIs to, <br/>
on average, range from $929 million to $4.4 billion. If we assume, based on our cost estimates, <br/>
an annual cost to health IT developers of $414 million and that increased developer costs are <br/>
passed to customers, then the net benefit to hospitals/providers would range from $515 million to <br/>
$3.3 billion. The midpoint of ranges stated is used as the primary estimate of benefits. <br/>

As we stated above, for table 19, we assume APIs provide both patients and clinicians <br/>
with increased access to EHI, which will have a direct impact on physicians by making their <br/>
work more efficient. Extrapolating the numbers from literature, we assume this technology will <br/>

improve physicians’ time by 1%-5%. Also as stated above, for Table 20, we assume APIs affect <br/>
utilization through marginal improvements in interoperability. For this reason, in addition to <br/>
APIs, we needed to incorporate the impact of interoperability on each of the outcomes. We <br/>
request comment on these assumptions. Specifically, whether they are appropriate and whether <br/>
there are alternative assumptions or bases upon which we should make our assumptions.   <br/>
 <br/>
We expect additional benefits from the use of APIs could be derived from increased <br/>
patient, and eventually payer, access to EHI. APIs make it easier for patients to transmit data to <br/>
and from different sources. According to the Health Information National Trends Survey,<a href="ONCs.html#572">173</a> half <br/>
of Americans were offered access to an online medical record by a provider or insurer in 2017. <br/>
However, among those who were offered access, only 53% accessed their record at least once <br/>
within the last year, and only 3.6% of individuals who accessed their record reported transmitting <br/>
their data to a service or application. The proportion of individuals accessing their online health <br/>
information and transmitting their information to third parties is expected to grow as APIs <br/>
become more widespread and make more data available in a computable format. Growing <br/>
evidence suggests that patients who have access to their EHI are more likely to adhere to medical <br/>
orders including screening recommendations.<a href="ONCs.html#572">174</a> Thus, we expect such patients would ultimately <br/>
realize improved health outcomes.  <br/>
 <br/>
In addition, the use of APIs to support the exchange and analysis of payment related data <br/>
(including price information) would improve cost transparency in the market, increase the <br/>
availability of valuable information for payers and patients, and likely drive down health care <br/>

prices. For instance, a recent study by the Minnesota Department of Health showed that the <br/>
pricing for knee replacement surgery, which is a standard procedure in many hospitals, can vary <br/>
significantly across practices in the same locality. The Minnesota study showed that Minnesota <br/>
insurers paid as much as $47,000 for a patient's total knee replacement and as little as $6,200 — a <br/>
nearly eight-fold price difference. In addition to total knee replacements, the study found that total hip <br/>
replacement costs ranged from $6,700 to $44,000, a 6½-fold difference. Typical vaginal baby delivery <br/>
ranged from $2,900 to $12,300, while C-section deliveries ranged from $4,700 to $22,800. Another <br/>
study by Premier in conjunction with Wake Forest University Medical Center found similar results. <br/>
Among 350 hospitals, the average cost of primary knee implants was $4,464. Yet, 50% of the <br/>
hospitals paid between $4,066 and $5,609 on the devices. Further, the same group of hospitals paid an <br/>
average of $5,252 for primary hip implants, but 50% of the hospitals paid between $4,759 and $6,463. <br/>
The studies illustrated the secretive nature of pricing in the health care market, as well as the extreme <br/>
variations in price that can exist for the same procedure within the same locality.<a href="ONCs.html#573">175, 176</a> While this <br/>
study was the first-ever local study of insurance company payments to hospitals for those four <br/>

would drive health care prices down, which could lead to significant benefits across the health care <br/>
continuum. <br/>
 <br/>
While the examples above emphasize procedures that tend to have defined end points, the <br/>
eventual population health queries would more broadly allow payers and analytics firms working <br/>
for employers to computationally examine the care providers render. Not only is price <br/>
transparency currently missing from the marketplace, but for most inpatient care, the actual <br/>
details of care are largely unobtainable through any APIs. However, we are not aware of an <br/>
approach for quantifying these types of benefits and welcome comments on potential approaches <br/>
to quantifying these benefits.  <br/>
<i>2.4 New Privacy and Security Certification Criteria </i><br/>
To be certified to the new privacy and security certification criteria, encrypt <br/>
authentication credentials (§ 170.315(d)(12)) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) (§ 170.315 <br/>
(d)(13)), we are proposing to require health IT developers to assess their Health IT Modules’ <br/>
capabilities and attest “yes” or “no” to the certification criteria. As specified in section IV.C.3 of <br/>
this proposed rule, we are proposing to make these certification criteria applicable to all Health <br/>
IT Modules under the Program. For encrypt authentication credentials and multi-factor <br/>
authentication, we are proposing to require a simple attestation. For MFA, we are also proposing <br/>
to require that if the health IT developer attests to supporting MFA, the health IT developer <br/>
would need to explain how it supports MFA. We also request public comment on whether there <br/>
is value in adopting an MFA criterion and whether the health IT developer should explain how it <br/>
supports MFA. <br/>

 <br/>
These criteria are not intended to place additional burden on health IT developers as they <br/>
do not require new development or implementation. Rather, a health IT developer is only <br/>
required to attest to whether they encrypt authentication credentials or support MFA. We expect <br/>
the costs associated with attesting to these criteria to be de minimis because we do not expect <br/>
additional forms to be required and expect minimal effort would be required to complete the <br/>
attestation. We welcome comments on these expectations. The midpoint of ranges stated is used <br/>
as the primary estimate of costs and benefits. <br/>
<i>Benefits  </i><br/>
As stated previously, we are not requiring health IT developers to encrypt authentication <br/>
credentials or support MFA. Instead, we are requiring they attest to whether they support the <br/>
certification criteria or not. By requiring an attestation, we are promoting transparency, which <br/>
might motivate some health IT developers that do not currently encrypt authentication <br/>
credentials or support MFA to do so. If health IT developers are motivated by this criteria and <br/>
ultimately do encrypt authentication credentials and/or support MFA, we acknowledge that there <br/>
would be costs to do so; however, we assume that the benefits would substantially exceed the <br/>
costs. Encrypting authentication credentials and adopting MFA would reduce the likelihood that <br/>
authentication credentials would be compromised and would eliminate an unnecessary use of IT <br/>
resources. Encrypting authentication credentials and adopting MFA could directly reduce <br/>
providers’ operating/support costs, which would reduce their administrative and financial <br/>
burden. Encrypting authentication credentials would also help decrease costs and burden by <br/>
reducing the number of password resets due to possible phishing or other vulnerabilities. <br/>

According to Verizon’s 2017 Data Breach Investigations Report, 81% of hacking-related <br/>
breaches leveraged either stolen and/or weak passwords.<a href="ONCs.html#576">178 </a>The Verizon report encourages <br/>
customers to vary their passwords and use two-factor authentication. Also, NIST Special <br/>
Publication 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines, <i>Authentication and Lifecycle Management</i>,<a href="ONCs.html#576">179 </a><br/>
recommends the use of and provides the requirements for using multi-factor authenticators. <br/>
Based on these reports and other anecdotal evidence, we believe encrypting authentication <br/>
credentials and supporting MFA are established best practices among industry developers, <br/>
including health IT developers. As described above, we propose to require health IT developers <br/>
to attest to whether they encrypt authentication credentials. We do not have access to published <br/>
literature that details how health IT developers are already encrypting authentication credentials <br/>
and supporting MFA industry-wide, but we believe the majority of health IT developers, or <br/>
around 80%, are taking such actions. We assume that building this functionality is in the future <br/>
project plans for the remaining 20% because, as noted previously, adopting these capabilities is <br/>
an industry best practice. Health IT developers that have not yet adopted these capabilities are <br/>
likely already making financial investments to get up to speed with industry standards. We <br/>
believe our proposal may motivate these health IT developers to speed their implementation <br/>
process, but we have not attributed a monetary estimate to this potential benefit because our rule <br/>
is not a direct cause of health IT developers adopting these capabilities. By the time we release <br/>
the final rule, many more, or perhaps all, health IT developers will likely already be encrypting <br/>

<i>2.5 Data Segmentation for Privacy-Send and Data Segmentation for Privacy-Receive; </i><br/>
<i>and Consent Management for APIs </i><br/>
We propose to remove the current 2015 Edition Data Segmentation for Privacy (DS4P)-<br/>
send (§ 170.315(b)(7)) and DS4P-receive (§ 170.315(b)(8)) certification criteria which apply the <br/>
DS4P standard at the document level. We propose to replace these two criteria with three new <br/>
2015 Edition DS4P certification criteria (two for C-CDA and one for FHIR) that would support a <br/>
more granular approach to privacy tagging data for health information exchange supported by <br/>
either the C-CDA- or FHIR-based exchange standards. In place of the removed 2015 Edition <br/>
DS4P criteria, we propose to adopt new DS4P-send (§ 170.315(b)(12)) and DS4P-receive <br/>
(§ 170.315(b)(13)) criteria that would remain based on the C-CDA and the HL7 DS4P standard. <br/>
These criteria would include capabilities for applying the DS4P standard at the document, <br/>
section, and entry level. We also propose to adopt a third 2015 Edition DS4P certification <br/>
criterion “consent management for APIs” (§ 170.315(g)(11)) that requires health IT to be capable <br/>
of responding to requests for data through an API in accordance with the Consent <br/>
Implementation Guide. Our primary purpose for proposing to remove and replace them, in lieu <br/>
of proposing to revise them, is to provide clarity to stakeholders as to the additional functionality <br/>
enabled by health IT certified to the new criteria. <br/>
<i>Costs </i> <br/>
We anticipate this proposal could result in up-front costs to health IT developers as this <br/>
new criteria would require the health IT to support all three levels – document, section, and entry <br/>

– as specified in the current DS4P standard. However, we note that these criteria are not being <br/>
required in any program at this time. As of the beginning of the third quarter of the 2018 CY, <br/>
only about 20 products (products with multiple certified versions were counted once) were <br/>
certified to the current 2015 Edition DS4P certification criteria. We estimate that 10-15 products <br/>
will implement the new DS4P criteria. Developers may need to perform fairly extensive health <br/>
IT upgrades to support the more complex and granular data tagging requirements under these <br/>
criteria. We anticipate developers will need approximately 1500-2500 hours to upgrade <br/>
databases and/or other backend infrastructure to appropriately apply security labels to data and/or <br/>
develop access control capabilities. Moreover, developers will likely incur costs to upgrade <br/>
health IT to generate a security-labeled C-CDA conforming to the DS4P standard. We estimate <br/>
developers will need 400-600 hours per criterion to make these upgrades on systems that had <br/>
previously certified to the document-level DS4P criteria, or 720-1220 hours per criterion for <br/>
systems that are implementing these criteria for the first time. We believe this work would be <br/>
performed by a “Software Developer.” According to the May 2016 BLS occupational <br/>
employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for software developer is $50.14. As noted <br/>
previously, we have assumed that overhead costs (including benefits) are equal to 100% of pre-<br/>
tax wages, so the hourly wage including overhead costs is $100.28. Therefore, we estimate the <br/>
total cost to developers could range from $2,306,440 to $7,430,748. We note that this would be a <br/>
one-time cost. The midpoint of ranges stated is used as the primary estimate of costs and <br/>
benefits. <br/>
Additionally, our proposal supports the capability to respond to requests for patient <br/>
consent information through an API compatible with FHIR Release 3. In order to meet the <br/>

“consent management for APIs” criteria, developers would demonstrate compatibility with the <br/>
standards framework used for the Consent Implementation Guide. We have estimated costs <br/>
associated with this aspect of our proposal using the following assumptions: <br/>
1.  We estimate developers will require 1,500-3,500 hours to upgrade health IT to align with the <br/>
FHIR STU3 data model and develop a STU3 compatible FHIR server.  <br/>
2.  As with the two DS4P criteria, we anticipate developers will need approximately 1,500-2,500 <br/>
hours to upgrade databases and/or other backend infrastructure to appropriately apply <br/>
security labels to data and/or develop access control capabilities. We expect that this would <br/>
be a one-time cost. <br/>
3.  Because certification to this criterion is voluntary and because supporting this criterion <br/>
requires implementation of a version of FHIR (STU3) that does not align with the other API <br/>
criterion in this rule (based on DSTU2), we estimate the number of products that will support <br/>
this criterion is approximately 5% of the total number of 2015 certified products. We used a <br/>
proxy to determine the number of health IT developers that may develop an API for the 2015 <br/>
Edition. There were 598 products and 506 developers with at least one 2014 Edition certified <br/>
product that could perform transitions of care. We then multiplied this number by our <br/>
certified health IT market consolidation estimates of -22.1% and -23.2% to project the <br/>
number of 2015 developers and products, respectively; we estimate that 459 products from <br/>
394 developers will contain the API criterion. Therefore, we anticipate 23 products from 20 <br/>
developers will certify to the “consent management for APIs” criterion. We believe this work <br/>
would be performed by a “Software Developer.”  <br/>

certification criteria given the benefits to interoperable exchange. We welcome comments on this <br/>
analysis. <br/>
We anticipate potential costs for ONC related to this proposal associated with: (1) <br/>
developing and maintaining information regarding these new criteria on the ONC website; (2) <br/>
creating documents related to these new criteria and making those documents 508 compliant; (3) <br/>
updating, revising, and supporting Certification Companion Guides, test procedures, and test <br/>
tools; and (4) responding to inquiries concerning these criteria. We estimate an ONC analyst at <br/>
the GS-13, Step 1 level staff would devote, on average, 200 hours to the above tasks annually. <br/>
The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is <br/>
approximately $88.30. Therefore, we estimate the annual costs to be $17,660.  <br/>
<i>Benefits </i> <br/>
We believe leveraging the DS4P standard’s ability to allow for both document level and <br/>
more granular tagging would offer functionality that is more valuable to providers and patients, <br/>
especially given the complexities of the privacy landscape for multiple care and specialty <br/>
settings. We also believe this proposal would benefit providers, patients, and ONC because it <br/>
would support more complete records, contribute to patient safety, and enhance care <br/>
coordination. We believe this proposal could also reduce burden for providers by enabling an <br/>
automated option, rather relying on case-by-case manual redaction and subsequent workarounds <br/>
to transmit redacted documents. We emphasize that health care providers already have processes <br/>
and workflows to address their existing compliance obligations, which could be made more <br/>
efficient and cost effective through the use of health IT. We expect these benefits for providers, <br/>
patients, and ONC to be significant; however, we are unable to quantify these benefits at this <br/>

(3) Conditions and Maintenance of Certification<b> </b><br/>
<i>3.1 Information Blocking </i><br/>
 <br/>
For a discussion of the costs and benefits of the exceptions to information blocking <br/>
proposed in this rule, please see section (5) of this RIA.  <br/>
<i> </i><br/>
<i>3.2 Assurances</i> <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
We are proposing that health IT developers must make certain assurances as Conditions <br/>
and Maintenance of Certification: (1) assurances regarding the electronic health information <br/>
export certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(10) and (2) assurances regarding retaining records <br/>
and information. <br/>
<i>3.2.1 Electronic Health Information Export  </i><br/>
We propose, as a Condition of Certification requirement, that a health IT system that <br/>
produces and electronically manages electronic health information must be certified to the 2015 <br/>
Edition “electronic health information export” certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(10). <br/>
Further, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement, health IT developers must comply with <br/>
this proposed Condition of Certification requirement within 24 months of a subsequent final <br/>
rule’s effective date or at the time of certification if the health IT developer never previously <br/>
certified health IT to the 2015 Edition. As another Maintenance of Certification requirement, we <br/>
propose that health IT developers must provide all of their customers with the functionality <br/>
included in § 170.315(b)(10).  <br/>

For a detailed discussion of the costs and benefits of the assurances regarding the <br/>
electronic health information export certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(10), please see section <br/>
2.2 of this RIA above. <i> </i><br/>
<i>3.2.2 Records and Information Retention </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose that, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement, a health IT developer <br/>
must, for a period of 10 years beginning from the date of certification, retain all records and <br/>
information necessary that demonstrate initial and ongoing compliance with the requirements of <br/>
the ONC Health IT Certification Program. In an effort to reduce administrative burden, we also <br/>
propose, that in situations where applicable certification criteria are removed from the Code of <br/>
Federal Regulations before the 10 years have expired, records must only be kept for 3 years from <br/>
the date of removal for those certification criteria and related Program provisions unless that <br/>
timeframe would exceed the overall 10-year retention period. This “3-year from the date of <br/>
removal” records retention period also aligns with the records retention requirements for ONC-<br/>
ACBs and ONC-ATLs under the Program. <br/>
Currently, there are no existing regulatory requirements regarding record and information <br/>
retention by health IT developers. We expect the costs to developers to retain the records and <br/>
information described above to be mitigated due to the following factors. First, we expect that <br/>
health IT developers are already keeping the majority of their records and information in an <br/>
electronic format. Second, we expect that health IT developers already have systems in place for <br/>
retaining records and information. Last, we expect that some developers may already be <br/>
retaining records and information for extended periods of time due to existing requirements of <br/>
other programs, including for those programs their customers participate in. For instance, <br/>

 <br/>
Medicaid managed care companies are required to keep records for ten years from the effective <br/>
date of a contract.   <br/>
 <br/>
We estimate that each health IT developer will, on average, spend two hours each week <br/>
to comply with our proposed record retention requirement. We expect that a health IT <br/>
developer’s office clerk could complete the record retention responsibilities. According to the <br/>
May 2016 BLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for an office clerk is <br/>
$15.87.<a href="ONCs.html#584">180</a>  As noted previously, we have assumed that overhead costs (including benefits) are <br/>
equal to 100% of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage including overhead costs is $31.74. <br/>
Therefore, we estimate the annual cost per developer would, on average, be $3,301 and the total <br/>
annual cost for all health IT developers (458 health IT developers have products certified to the <br/>
2015 Edition that are capable of recording patient health data) would, on average, be $1.5 <br/>
million. We note that this is a perpetual cost. We welcome comments on these cost estimates. <br/>
<i>3.3 Prohibition or Restriction of Communications Costs </i><br/>
 <br/>
Health IT developers would need to notify their customers about the unenforceability of <br/>
communications and contract provisions that violate this Condition of Certification. Generally, <br/>
health IT developers should already have mechanisms in place, whether via online postings, <br/>
email, mail, or phone, for alerting customers to changes in their policies and procedures. Such <br/>
alerts should be standard practice. However, we have estimated the potential costs for health IT <br/>
developers to draft the notice and mail the notice as appropriate. We estimate that a health IT <br/>
developer’s office clerk will commit (overall) approximately 40 hours to drafting and mailing <br/>
                                                 <br/>

notices when necessary. According to the May 2016 BLS occupational employment statistics, <br/>
the mean hourly wage for an office clerk is $15.87.<a href="ONCs.html#585">181</a>As noted previously, we have assumed that <br/>
overhead costs (including benefits) are equal to 100% of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage <br/>
including overhead costs is $31.74. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost per developer to be <br/>
$1,270 and the total cost for all health IT developers (792 health IT developers certified to the <br/>
2014 Edition) to be $1 million. We note that this is a one-time cost and would not be perpetual. <br/>
 <br/>
We also note that mailing is one option for delivery, along with other means such as <br/>
email. We do not have information concerning how health IT developers will deliver their <br/>
notices. We have estimated a total cost for all developers to mail the notices (including postage) <br/>
to be $80,000. Again, we note that this is a one-time cost. We welcome comments on these cost <br/>
estimates. <br/>
 <br/>
In order to meet the Cures Act requirement that health IT developers do not prohibit or <br/>
restrict communication regarding health IT,<i> </i>some health IT developers would eventually need to <br/>
amend their contracts to reflect such a change. Many standard form health IT contracts limit the <br/>
ability of users to voluntarily discuss problems or report usability and safety concerns that they <br/>
experience when using their health IT. This type of discussion or reporting is typically prohibited <br/>
through broad confidentiality, nondisclosure, and intellectual property provisions in the vendor’s <br/>
standard form health IT contract. Some standard form health IT contracts may also include non-<br/>
disparagement clauses that prohibit customers from making statements that could reflect <br/>
negatively on the health IT developer. These practices are often referred to colloquially in the <br/>
                                                 <br/>

industry as “gag clauses.” We expect amendments to these clauses to be accomplished in the <br/>
normal course of business, such as when renegotiating contracts or updating them for HIPAA or <br/>
other compliance requirements. As such, we do not estimate any direct or indirect costs for <br/>
health IT developers to amend their contracts to comply with this condition of certification.  <br/>
 <br/>
<i>Benefits </i><br/>
 <br/>
We expect health care providers to benefit from this proposal. There is growing <br/>
recognition that these practices of prohibiting or restricting communication do not promote <br/>
health IT safety or good security hygiene and that health IT contracts should support and <br/>
facilitate the transparent exchange of information relating to patient care. We are unable to <br/>
estimate these benefits because we do not have adequate information to determine the prevalence <br/>
of gag clauses and other such restrictive practices, nor do we have a means to quantify the value <br/>
to providers of being able to freely communicate and share information. We welcome comments <br/>
on approaches to quantify these benefits. <br/>
<i>3.4 Application Programming Interfaces </i><br/>
 <br/>
For a discussion of the costs and benefits of the new API criterion, please see section 2.3 <br/>
of this RIA.  <br/>
<i>3.5 Transparency Requirements for Application Programming Interfaces </i><br/>
We propose as part of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification that API <br/>
Technology Suppliers be required to make specific business and technical documentation <br/>
necessary to interact with the APIs in production freely and publicly accessible. We expect that <br/>
the API Technology Suppliers would perform the following tasks related to transparency of <br/>
business and technical documentation and would devote the following number of hours annually <br/>

to such task: (1) Health Level 7’s (HL7®) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) <br/>
API documentation (the vendor would most likely point to the HL7 FHIR standard for API <br/>
documentation) (estimated eight hours); (2) patient application registration documentation, <br/>
which would include a development effort to create a website that manages the application <br/>
registration activity (estimated 40 hours); (3) publication of the FHIR Endpoint – Base URLs for <br/>
all centrally managed providers (estimated 40 hours); (4) publication of FHIR Endpoints for <br/>
provider-managed APIs (estimated 160 hours); and (5) API cost information documentation, <br/>
which would typically be documented as a tiered rate based on usage or some form of monthly <br/>
rate (estimated 40 hours).  <br/>
We believe each of the above tasks would be performed by a “Software Developer.” <br/>
According to the May 2016 BLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for <br/>
software developer is $50.14 <a href="ONCs.html#587">182</a> As noted previously, we have assumed that overhead costs <br/>
(including benefits) are equal to 100% of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage including overhead <br/>
costs is $100.28. Therefore, we estimate the cost per developer to be $28,881. As noted in <br/>
section 2.3 of this RIA, we estimate that 459 products from 394 developers will contain the API <br/>
criterion. Therefore, we estimate the total developer total would be $11.4 million. We note that <br/>
this is a one-time cost and would not be perpetual.   <br/>
<i>3.6 Real World Testing  </i><br/>
<i> </i><br/>
The objective of real world testing is to verify the extent to which deployed health IT <br/>
products in operational production settings are demonstrating compliance to certification criteria <br/>

 <br/>
and functioning with the intended use cases for continued maintenance of certification. Real <br/>
world testing should ensure certified health IT products have the ability to share electronic health <br/>
information between other systems. Real world testing should assess that the certified health IT <br/>
is meeting the intended use case(s) of the certification criteria to which it is certified within the <br/>
workflow, health IT architecture, and care/practice setting in which the health IT is implemented. <br/>
We note that we expect real world testing would take about three months of the year to perform.    <br/>
<i>Costs </i><br/>
 <br/>
This section describes the potential costs of the real world testing requirements in this <br/>
proposed rule. The costs estimates are based on the following assumptions: <br/>
 <br/>1.  <b>Health IT developers will use the same labor costs</b>. Table 24 shows the estimated labor <br/>
costs for a health IT developer to perform real world testing. We recognize that health IT <br/>
developer costs will vary; however, our estimates in this section assume all developers will <br/>
incur the costs noted in Table 24. <br/>
2.  <b>Proxy needed to project the number of 2015 Edition products impacted by real world </b><br/>
<b>testing. </b>We estimate that 523 products from 429 developers will be impacted by real world <br/>
testing. We used a proxy to determine developers that would be subject to real world testing <br/>
There were 681 products and 551 developers with at least one of its 2014 Edition certified <br/>
products that could perform either (or both) transitions of care and/or send any type of public <br/>
health data. We then multiplied these numbers by our estimates for certified health IT market <br/>
consolidation by -22.1% and -23.2% to project number of 2015 developers and products, <br/>
respectively. We believe this estimate serves as a reasonable proxy for products impacted by <br/>
real world testing, as these products primarily focus on interoperability. <br/>

 <br/>
Based on the stated assumptions and costs outlined in the above tables, we estimate the <br/>
total annual cost for real world testing would, on average, be $46 million with an average cost <br/>
per developer of $107,259.   <br/>
<i>Benefits </i> <br/>
 <br/>
There are a number of benefits that can be attributed to real world testing. Real world <br/>
testing may impact the effective integration of varied health IT systems, including integration of <br/>
certified health IT with non-certified and ancillary technologies such as picture archiving and <br/>
communications systems (PACS) or specialty specific interfaces. Real world testing might also <br/>
have an effect on the effective implementation of workflows in a clinical setting. In this analysis, <br/>
we have calculated the benefits in the following categories: <br/>
1.  Provider time saved documenting in their EHR due to improved usability.  <br/>
2.  Increased provider satisfaction with their EHR resulting in fewer providers incurring the <br/>
costs of switching products.  <br/>
3.  Benefits related to reductions in duplicate lab tests, readmissions, ER visits, and adverse drug <br/>
events due to increased interoperability. We focused on these outcomes for two reasons: (i) <br/>
evidence in literature indicate that health information exchange impacts the chosen measures; <br/>
and (ii) cost of care associated with these measures is high and the impact of health <br/>
information exchange is likely to result in significant benefits in the form of reduced costs. <br/>
The benefit calculations are based on the following assumptions:  <br/>
1.  <b>Benefits noted in academic literature are assumed accurate and results were not </b><br/>
<b>externally validated</b>. Estimates of the benefits associated with the benefits are based on <br/>

estimates obtained from the academic literature. Staff reviewed the academic articles for <br/>
validity, but estimates were not replicated to confirm accuracy.   <br/>
2.  <b>Hospitals and eligible professionals that participate in the CMS EHR Incentive </b><br/>
<b>Program will be impacted</b>. Estimates are based on the assumption that 439,187 health care <br/>
providers and/or 4,519 hospitals will be affected by this regulatory action. <br/>
3.  <b>Estimates of the impact of real world testing on rates of interoperability (0.1 to 1%) are </b><br/>
<b>based on ONC analysis</b>. To identify the impact of real world testing on interoperability, we <br/>
used regression analysis. Specifically, we estimated linear probability models that identified <br/>
impact of 2014 Edition certified EHR on hospitals’ interoperability (whether a hospital <br/>
sends, receives, finds, and integrates summary of care records). Using data from the AHA <br/>
from years 2014-2015 in the model, we controlled for hospital size, profit status, <br/>
participation in a health information organization, and state and year fixed effects. The <br/>
marginal effect of using a 2014 Edition was a five percentage point increase in <br/>
interoperability. This is an upper bound estimate. For the purpose of this analysis, we assume <br/>
0.1% to 1% would be a reasonable range for real world testing to impact interoperability.  <br/>
4.  <b>Impact of real world testing is also based on the estimated number of providers that </b><br/>
<b>switch health IT developers (rate = 5%).</b> Using CMS Medicare EHR Incentive Program <br/>
data from years 2013-2016, we estimate the rate of providers (hospitals and eligible <br/>
professionals) that changed their health IT developer.   <br/>
5.  <b>Estimates of the rate of eligible professionals (10%) and hospitals (5%) that will be </b><br/>
<b>impacted by real world testing are based on ONC complaint data. </b>Because real world <br/>
testing is designed to improve usability and interoperability of products, we assume that <br/>

 <br/>
those eligible professionals and hospitals most likely to be impacted are those who currently <br/>
use products by health IT developers with complaints.  <br/>
 <br/>
As noted previously in this analysis, we acknowledge that there might be shared benefits <br/>
across certain proposals and have taken steps to ensure that the benefits attributed to each <br/>
proposal are unique to the proposal referenced. Specifically, we used regression analysis to <br/>
calculate the impact of our real world testing and API proposals on interoperability. We assumed <br/>
that the real world testing and API proposals would collectively have the same impact on <br/>
interoperability as use of 2014 Edition certified health IT. Therefore, we estimated linear <br/>
probability models that identified the impact of 2014 Edition certified health IT on hospitals’ <br/>
interoperability.<a href="ONCs.html#592">183 </a>We controlled for additional factors such as participation in a health <br/>
information exchange organization, hospital characteristics, and urban/rural status. We found the <br/>
marginal effect of using 2014 Edition certified health IT was a five percentage point increase in <br/>
interoperability. <br/>
 <br/>
While we acknowledge that there might be shared benefits across proposals, we have <br/>
taken steps to ensure that the benefits attributed to each proposal is unique to the proposal <br/>
referenced. We assumed that this marginal effect is true for our proposals and distributed the 5% <br/>
benefit across our real world testing and API proposals at (.1-1%) to (1-4%) respectively. <br/>
Moreover, the number of providers impacted is proposal specific. Given data limitations, we <br/>
believe this approach allows us to estimate the benefits of our proposals without double counting <br/>
the impact each proposal might have on interoperability. <br/>

The first table below shows benefits of real world testing for providers where we <br/>
monetize the impact of real world testing as total amount saved by reducing provider time spent <br/>
with the health IT. The impact of real world testing on provider time is expected to represent a <br/>
larger impact (5%) than the impact of real world testing on health outcomes (1%-4%) and cost. <br/>
This is primarily because provider behavior is more directly affected by improvements in <br/>
interoperability.      <br/>

 <br/>
Based on the stated assumptions and benefits outlined in Table 26 above, we estimate the <br/>
total annual benefit for real world testing to providers would, on average, range from $105 <br/>
million to $516 million. Based on the stated assumptions and benefits outlined in Table 27 <br/>
above, we estimate the total annual benefit for patients and payers would, on average, range from <br/>
$4.3 million to $25.5 million. Therefore, we estimate the total benefit of real world testing <br/>
would, on average, range from $109.3 million to $541.5 million. If we assume, based on our cost <br/>
estimates, the average annual costs to health IT developers would be $46 million and that <br/>
increased health IT developer costs are passed to customers, then the net benefit to <br/>
hospitals/providers would range from $63.3 million to $495.5 million. <br/>
 <br/>
We recognize that health IT developers may deploy their systems in a number of ways, <br/>
including cloud-based deployments, and seek comment on whether our cost estimates of real <br/>
world testing should factor in such methods of system deployment. For example, we request <br/>
feedback about whether health IT developers would incur reduced real world testing costs <br/>

solicit comment on the general ratio of cloud-based to non-cloud-based deployments within the <br/>

type of deployment. We also request comment on our assumptions about the burden to providers <br/>

<i>3.6.1</i> <i>Real World Testing Maintenance Requirements </i><br/>
 <br/>
We propose to revise the Principle of Proper Conduct in § 170.523(m) to require ONC-<br/>
ACBs to collect, no less than quarterly, all updates successfully made to standards in certified <br/>
health IT pursuant to the developers having opted to avail themselves of the Standards Version <br/>
Advancement Process flexibility under the real world testing Condition of Certification. Under § <br/>
170.523(p), ONC-ACBs will be responsible for: (1) reviewing and confirming that applicable <br/>
health IT developers submit real world testing plans in accordance with § 170.405(b)(1); (2) <br/>
reviewing and confirming that applicable health IT developers submit real world testing results <br/>
in accordance with § 170.405(b)(2); and (3) submitting real world testing plans by December 15 <br/>
and results by April 1 of each calendar year to ONC for public availability. In addition, under § <br/>
170.523(t), ONC-ACBs will be required to: (1) maintain a record of the date of issuance and the <br/>
content of developers’ notices; and (2) timely post content of each notice on the CHPL. <br/>
 <br/>
Using the information from the “Real World Testing” section of this RIA, we estimate <br/>
that 429 developers will be impacted by real world testing. We estimate that, on average, it will <br/>
take an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-13, Step 1 level approximately 30 minutes to collect all <br/>

Washington, DC is approximately $88.30. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost to ONC-ACBs <br/>
to comply with the submission and reporting requirements under §§ 170.523(m) and 170.550(l) <br/>
to be $143,891. <br/>

Throughout the RIA we have used 830 products as our 2015 Edition Projection. We came <br/>
up with this projection by multiplying a -23.2% market consolidation rate from the total number <br/>
of products certified to 2014 Edition. This assumption was based on the market consolidation <br/>
rate observed between the 2011 and 2014 Editions. We have estimated the number of 2015 <br/>
Edition products that will certify each criteria included in the real world testing Condition of <br/>
Certification. We assume that there will be a cost associated with a notice for each certified <br/>
criteria (even if an individual product were to update the same standard across multiple criteria <br/>

Edition products that certify a criteria by the estimated number of total 2015 Edition products <br/>
(830). <br/>
We assume that the amount of time for an ONC-ACB staff person to (1) maintain a <br/>
record of the date of issuance and the content of developers’ notices; and (2) to timely post <br/>
content of each notice on the CHPL can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour. <br/>
The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC <br/>
is approximately $88.30. This was the hourly rate we used for the RIA, so it’s consistent with <br/>
prior calculations. This wage is used to determine the ONC-ACB time cost to complete this <br/>
requirement under § 170.523(t). Our minimum estimate for the amount of time to comply is 30 <br/>
minutes per notice. If 25% of certified products update any of the applicable standards, we <br/>
estimate it will cost $58,807. If all products update any of the applicable standards, we estimate <br/>
it will cost $235,231. Our maximum estimate for the amount of time to comply is 1 hour per <br/>
notice. If 25% of certified products update any of the applicable standards, we estimate it will <br/>
cost $117,615. If all products update any of the applicable standards, we estimate it will cost <br/>
$470,462. Our lower bound estimate for the cost of this requirement is $58,807. Our upper <br/>

 <br/>
health IT allows for health information to be exchanged, accessed, and used in the <br/>
manner described by the API Condition of Certification. We propose to implement the Cures Act <br/>
“attestations” Condition of Certification in § 170.406 by requiring health IT developers to attest <br/>
to the aforementioned conditions. For the purposes of estimating the potential burden of these <br/>
attestations on health IT developers, ONC-ACBs, and ONC, we are estimating that all health IT <br/>
developers under the Program will submit an attestation biannually. As noted previously in this <br/>
RIA, there are 792 health IT developers certified to the 2014 Edition.  <br/>
 <br/>
We estimate it will take a health IT developer employee approximately one hour on <br/>
average to prepare and submit each attestation to the ONC-ACB. According to the May 2016 <br/>
BLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for a software developer is <br/>
$50.14 <a href="ONCs.html#599">184 </a>Therefore, we estimate the annual cost including overhead costs to be $79,422. <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that attestations would be submitted to ONC-ACBs on behalf of ONC and <br/>
the Secretary. We assume there will be three ONC-ACBs as this is the current number of ONC-<br/>
ACBs, and we also assume an equal distribution in responsibilities among ONC-ACBs. ONC-<br/>
ACBs would have two responsibilities related to attestations. One responsibility we propose in § <br/>
170.523(q) is that an ONC-ACB must review and submit the health IT developers’ attestations to <br/>
ONC. We estimate it will take an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-13, Step 1 level approximately <br/>
30 minutes on average to review and submit each attestation to ONC. The other responsibility we <br/>
propose in § 170.550(l) is that before issuing a certification, an ONC-ACB would need to ensure <br/>
that the health IT developer of the Health IT Module has met its responsibilities related to the <br/>

Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements as solely evidenced by its attestation. <br/>
We estimate it will take an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-13, Step 1 level approximately one <br/>
hour on average to complete this task. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 <br/>
employee located in Washington, DC is approximately $88.30. Therefore, we estimate the <br/>
annual cost to ONC-ACBs to be $209,801. <br/>
 <br/>
We propose that ONC would make the attestations publicly available on the CHPL once <br/>
they are submitted by the ONC-ACBs. ONC posts information regularly to the CHPL and we <br/>
estimate the added costs to post the attestation will be de minimis. We welcome comments if <br/>
stakeholders believe more or less networks should be included in our estimate. <br/>
(4) Oversight for the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification <br/>
 <br/>
ONC’s processes for overseeing the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification will, for <br/>
the most part, mirror ONC’s processes for direct review of non-conformities in certified health <br/>
IT as described in current § 170.580. We have proposed that ONC may directly review a health <br/>
IT developer’s actions to determine whether they conform to the Conditions and Maintenance of <br/>
Certification requirements proposed in this proposed rule. The estimated costs and benefits for <br/>
such oversight and review are detailed below. <br/>
<i>Costs  </i><br/>
We estimated the potential monetary costs of our proposal to allow ONC to directly <br/>
review a health IT developer’s actions to determine whether the actions conform to the <br/>
requirements of the Program as follows: (1) costs for health IT developers to correct non-<br/>
conforming actions identified by ONC; (2) costs for health IT developers and ONC related to <br/>
ONC review and inquiry into non-conforming actions by the health IT developer; and (3) costs <br/>

for ONC-ACBs related to the new proposed reporting requirement in the Principles of Proper <br/>
Conduct in § 170.523(s). <br/>
<i>Costs for Health IT Developers to Correct Non-Conforming Actions Identified by ONC </i><br/>
We do not believe health IT developers face additional direct costs for the proposed ONC <br/>
direct review of health IT developer actions (<i>see</i> cost estimates for the Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirements). However, we acknowledge that this proposed rule <br/>
may eventually require health IT developers to correct certain actions or non-conformities with <br/>
their health IT that do not conform to the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification.  <br/>
If ONC identifies a non-conforming action by a health IT developer, the costs incurred by <br/>
the health IT developer to bring its actions into conformance would be determined on a case-by-<br/>
case basis. Factors that would be considered include, but are not limited to: (1) the extent of <br/>
customers and/or business affected; (2) how pervasive the action(s) is across the health IT <br/>
developer’s business; (3) the period of time that the health IT developer was taking the action(s) <br/>
in question; and (4) the corrective action required to resolve the issue. We are unable to reliably <br/>
estimate these costs as we do not have cost estimates for a comparable situation. We request <br/>
comment on existing relevant data and methods we could use to estimate these costs.  <br/>
<i>Costs for Health IT Developers and ONC Related to ONC Review and Inquiry into <br/>Health IT Developer Actions <br/> <br/></i>In order to calculate the potential costs to health IT developers and ONC related to ONC <br/>
review and inquiry into health IT developer actions, we have created the following categories for <br/>
potential costs: (1) ONC review and inquiry prior to the issuance of a notice of non-conformity; <br/>
(2) ONC review and inquiry following the issuance of a notice of non-conformity and the health <br/>
IT developer does not contest ONC’s findings (i.e., no appeal); and (3) ONC review and inquiry <br/>

 <br/>
following the issuance of a notice of non-conformity and the health IT developer contests ONC’s <br/>
findings (i.e., appeal). <br/>
<i>ONC Review and Inquiry Prior to the Issuance of a Notice of Non-conformity </i><br/>
We anticipate that ONC will receive, on average, between 100 and 200 complaints per <br/>
year concerning the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification that will warrant review and <br/>
inquiry by ONC. We estimate that such initial review and inquiry by ONC would require, on <br/>
average, two to three analysts at the GS-13 level working one to two hours each per complaint. <br/>
The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is <br/>
approximately $88.30. Therefore, we estimate each review and inquiry would cost ONC, on <br/>
average, between $177 and $529. We estimate the total annual cost to ONC would, on average, <br/>
range from $17,700 and $105,800. This range takes into account both the low end of reviews that <br/>
are resolved quickly and the high end in which staff would need to discuss issues with ONC <br/>
leadership or in some cases, HHS senior leadership including the Office of General Counsel. We <br/>
have not estimated health IT developer costs associated with ONC review prior to the issuance of <br/>
a notice of non-conformity because, in most cases, health IT developers are not required to take <br/>
action prior to the notice of non-conformity. <br/>
<i>ONC Review and Inquiry Following the Issuance of a Notice of Non-conformity and the <br/>Health IT Developer Does Not Contest ONC’s Findings <br/> <br/></i>This category would capture cases that require review and inquiry following ONC’s <br/>
issuance of a notice of non-conformity, but that would not proceed to the appeals process. <br/>
Examples of such situations would include, but not be limited to: (1) a health IT developer <br/>
violates a Condition of Certification and does not contest ONC’s finding that it is in violation of <br/>
the Condition of Certification; or (2) a health IT developer fails to meet a deadline, such as for its <br/>

corrective action plan (CAP). We estimate that ONC will, on average, conduct between 12 and <br/>
18 of these reviews annually.  <br/>
We estimate that a health IT developer may commit, on average and depending on <br/>
complexity, between 10 and 40 hours of staff time per case to provide ONC with all requested <br/>
records and documentation that ONC would use to review and conduct an inquiry into health IT <br/>
developer actions, and, when necessary, make a certification ban and/or termination <br/>
determination. We assumed that the work would be performed by a “Computer Systems <br/>
Analyst.” According to the May 2016 BLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly <br/>
wage for computer systems analyst is $44.05. <a href="ONCs.html#603">185</a>  As noted previously, we have assumed that <br/>
overhead costs (including benefits) are equal to 100% of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage <br/>
including overhead costs would be $88.10. Therefore, we estimate the average annual cost for <br/>
health IT developers would range from $10,572 to $63,432. We note that some health IT <br/>
developers’ costs are expected to be less and some health IT developers’ costs are expected to be <br/>
more than this estimated cost range. Further, we note that these costs would be perpetual. <br/>
We estimate that ONC may commit, on average and depending on complexity, between 8 <br/>
and 80 hours of staff time to complete a review and inquiry into health IT developer actions. We <br/>
assume that the expertise of a GS-15, Step 1 federal employee(s) would be necessary. The hourly <br/>

<i>ONC Review and Inquiry Following the Issuance of a Notice of Non-Conformity and the <br/>Health IT Developer Contests ONC’s Findings <br/> <br/></i>As discussed in section VII.C of this preamble, we propose to permit a health IT <br/>
developer to appeal an ONC determination to issue a certification ban and/or terminate a <br/>
certification under §<b> </b>170.581(a)(2)(iii). This category of cost calculations captures cases that <br/>
require review and inquiry following ONC’s issuance of a notice of non-conformity and where <br/>
the health IT developer contests ONC’s finding and files an appeal. We estimate that ONC will, <br/>
on average, conduct between three and five of these reviews annually.  <br/>
We estimate that a “Computer Systems Analyst” for the health IT developer may commit, <br/>
on average and depending on complexity, between 20 and 80 hours to provide the required <br/>
information to appeal a certification ban and/or termination under §<b> </b>170.581(a)(2)(iii) and <br/>
respond to any requests from the hearing officer. According to the May 2016 BLS occupational <br/>

note that some health IT developers’ costs are expected to be less and some health IT developers’ <br/>
costs are expected to be more than this estimated cost range. Further, we note that these costs <br/>
would be perpetual. <br/>
We estimate that ONC would commit, on average and depending on complexity, between <br/>
40 and 160 hours of staff time to conduct each appeal. This would include the time to represent <br/>
ONC in the appeal and support the costs for the hearing officer. We assume that the expertise of <br/>
a GS-15, Step 1 federal employee(s) would be necessary. The hourly wage with benefits for a <br/>
GS-15, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately $122.74. Therefore, based <br/>
on the estimate on between three and five cases each year, we estimate the cost for ONC to <br/>
conduct an appeal would, on average, range from $14,729 to $98,192. We note that some appeals <br/>
may cost less and some may cost more than this estimated cost range. Further, we note that these <br/>
costs would be perpetual. <br/>
Based on the above estimates, we estimate the total<i> </i>annual costs for health IT developers <br/>
related to ONC review and inquiry into health IT developer actions would, on average, range <br/>
from $15,858 to $98,672. We estimate the total<i> </i>annual costs for ONC related to ONC review and <br/>
inquiry into health IT developer actions would, on average, range from $44,212 to $380,737.<i> </i><br/>
We welcome comments on our estimated costs and any comparable processes and costs <br/>

<i>Costs for ONC-ACBs </i><br/>

We also note that ONC-ACBs could realize costs associated with the new proposed <br/>

ONC direct review per § 170.580(a)(2). We estimate that, on average, it will take an ONC-ACB <br/>
employee at the GS-13, Step 1 level approximately 30 minutes to prepare the report. The hourly <br/>
wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately <br/>
$88.30. Since the collection must occur no less than weekly, we will assume it occurs, on <br/>
average, 52 times per year. Therefore, given that there are currently three ONC-ACBs, we <br/>
estimate the annual cost to ONC-ACBs to comply with the reporting requirement under § <br/>
170.523(s) would, on average, be $6,889. <br/>
<i>Benefits </i><br/>
This proposed rule’s provisions for ONC direct review of the Conditions and <br/>
Maintenance of Certification requirements would promote health IT developers’ accountability <br/>
for their actions and ensure that health IT developers’ actions conform with the requirements of <br/>
the Cures Act and Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements in §§ 170.400-406. <br/>
Specifically, ONC’s direct review of health IT developer actions will facilitate ONC’s ability to <br/>
require comprehensive corrective action by health IT developers to address non-conforming <br/>
actions determined by ONC. If ONC ultimately implements a certification ban and/or terminates <br/>
a certification(s), such action will serve to protect the integrity of the Program and users of health <br/>
IT. While we do not have available means to quantify the benefits of ONC direct review of <br/>
health IT developer actions, we note that ONC direct review supports and enables the National <br/>
Coordinator to fulfill his responsibilities under the HITECH Act and Cures Act, instills public <br/>
confidence in the Program, and protects public health and safety.   <br/>

We expect ONC to incur an annual cost for issuing guidance related to the information <br/>
blocking “reasonable and necessary” exceptions. We assume that the guidance would be <br/>
provided by ONC staff with the expertise of a GS-15, Step 1 federal employee(s). The hourly <br/>
wage with benefits for a GS-15, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately <br/>
$122.74. We estimate it would take ONC staff between 200 and 400 hours to develop the <br/>
guidance. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost to ONC would, on average, range from $98,192 <br/>
to $196,384.<i>   </i><br/>

Information blocking not only interferes with effective health information exchange, but <br/>
also negatively impacts many important aspects of health and health care. To make informed <br/>
health care decisions, providers and individuals must have timely access to information in a form <br/>
that is usable. When health information is unavailable, decisions can be impaired—and so too the <br/>
safety, quality, and effectiveness of care provided to patients. Information blocking impedes <br/>
progress towards reforming health care delivery and payment because sharing information <br/>
seamlessly across the care continuum is fundamental to moving to a person-centered, high-<br/>
performing health care system. Information blocking can undermine consumers’ confidence in <br/>
their health care providers by preventing individuals from accessing their health information and <br/>
using it to make informed decisions about their health and health care. Information blocking also <br/>
prevents advances in biomedical and public health research, which require the ability to analyze <br/>
information from many sources in order to identify public health risks, develop new treatments <br/>
and cures, and enable precision medicine.  <br/>

In addition, information blocking is a practice that is profoundly anti-consumer and anti-<br/>
competition. Information blocking can be used to increase revenue, escalate prices, and prevent <br/>
market competition both for current and future competitors and for new services. For instance, a <br/>
study released in 2017 about the prevalence of information blocking and how to address it <br/>
assessed the perceived motivations for information blocking. The study found that respondents <br/>
perceived that information-blocking practices by health IT developers were often motivated by a <br/>
desire to maximize short-term revenue and to increase the likelihood that providers will select <br/>
their health IT instead of a competitor's health IT. Among hospitals and health systems, the most <br/>
frequent perceived motivation was also related to improving revenue, namely to strengthen their <br/>
competitive position in the market, followed by accommodating more important internal <br/>
priorities than health information exchange.<a href="ONCs.html#608">187 </a><br/>
According to leaders of health information exchange efforts, information blocking is <br/>
relatively widespread.<a href="ONCs.html#608">188</a> Half of leaders of health information exchange efforts (n=60) <br/>
nationwide reported that they routinely encountered information blocking by health IT <br/>
developers. The top three types of information blocking practices they encountered on a routine <br/>
basis included: <br/>
•  Deployment of products with limited interoperability (49%);  <br/>
•  High fees for health information exchange unrelated to cost (47%); and <br/>
•  Making third-party access to standardized data difficult (42%).  <br/>

 <br/>
Many hospitals have experienced the negative impacts of health IT developer information <br/>
blocking practices. In 2015, almost half of hospitals (46%) nationwide reported difficulty <br/>
exchanging data with providers whose health IT system differed from theirs and one-quarter of <br/>
hospitals reported paying additional costs to exchange electronic health information with <br/>
providers outside their hospital system.<a href="ONCs.html#609">189 </a>There is also emerging evidence related to the <br/>
negative impacts of information blocking at the market level on hospitals’ health information <br/>
exchange activity.<a href="ONCs.html#609">190</a> Health information exchange activity among hospitals who are using a <br/>
dominant health IT developer within a given hospital referral region was found to be <br/>
significantly higher compared to those that are using a non-dominant health IT developer, <br/>
particularly in more competitive markets where dominant health IT developers had a smaller <br/>
share of the market. As information blocking diminishes and information blocking becomes less <br/>
prevalent, such gaps in rates of exchange and barriers to exchange of health information should <br/>
diminish. Considering the above motivations for and consequences of information blocking, we <br/>
believe health care providers and patients will benefit greatly from compliance with the <br/>
information blocking definition. Our proposal would promote the free flow of electronic health <br/>
information when and where it is needed.  <br/>
 <br/>
We have also included provisions in this proposed rule that would establish exceptions to <br/>
the definition of information blocking, which we estimate will generate significant net benefits. <br/>
As noted above, section 3022 of the PHSA defines information blocking broadly section <br/>
3022(a)(3) instructs authorizes the Secretary to identify reasonable and necessary activities that <br/>

would be considered establish exceptions to the definition of information blocking. In this rule, <br/>
we propose to establish several exceptions. The exceptions, if finalized, would create clear <br/>
guidelines for industry regarding pro-competitive and other beneficial activities and would <br/>
enable stakeholders to determine more easily and with greater certainty whether their activities <br/>
are excepted from the information blocking definition. The additional clarity provided by the <br/>
exceptions would make it easier for these regulated entities to comply with the statute—resulting <br/>
in reduced compliance costs—and would result in increased predictability, which would allow <br/>
regulated entities to more effectively plan and invest resources in developing and using <br/>
interoperable technologies and services to improve health care efficiency and value. Overall, the <br/>
proposed exceptions are accommodating to legitimate industry practices for health IT <br/>
developers, hospitals, and health care providers and, we believe, would ease the burden and <br/>
compliance costs for these parties. <br/>
Due to limited data and research available, we have only estimated the benefits of our <br/>
information blocking proposals for payers, specifically patients and insurers. In order to <br/>
quantify the magnitude of information blocking and the benefits of restricting information <br/>
blocking, we estimated the following expression, which gives us the imposed cost of information <br/>
blocking for each health outcome: [% providers that engage in cross-vendor exchange] <b>x</b> <br/>
[marginal effect (ME) of information blocking] <b>x </b>[ME effect of interoperability] <b>x</b> [total cost of <br/>
health outcome]. <br/>
 <br/>
We extracted the “ME effect of interoperability” and “cost of health outcomes” from <br/>
academic literature (<i>see </i>citations in Table 28). We used a proxy of the “percent of providers <br/>

engaged in cross-vendor exchange” with the “percent of hospitals engaged in cross-vendor <br/>
referral of patients outside their system” (82% in 2015).  <br/>
 <br/>
We estimated the “ME of information blocking” through the following research design.  <br/>
We looked at hospitals that switched vendors and examined their referral patterns before and <br/>
after the switch. If hospitals that switched vendors also had to change their referral patterns, this <br/>
could be evidence of information blocking. To operationalize this experiment, we estimated the <br/>
following equation: Y = b * S + r + h + e. <br/>
 <br/>
In this equation, the variables are as follows: <br/>
•  Y = Percent of referrals to providers using a vendor to which the hospital switched <br/>
•  b = Estimate of interest, which reflects the change in referral to the vendors after the switch <br/>
relative to hospitals that did not switch. After controlling for hospital and year fixed, this is <br/>
essentially an interaction effect of the year with the switch.  <br/>
•  S = Indicator for whether hospital switched vendor <br/>
•  r = Year <br/>
•  h = Hospital fixed effects <br/>
•  e = Error term (every regression has an error term) <br/>
 <br/>
We used CMS referral data and linked it with Healthcare Information and Management <br/>
Systems Society (HIMSS) and AHA data for information on hospitals’ vendors and other <br/>
characteristics. Our estimate for “b” is 0.4 percentage points, meaning if a hospital switches to <br/>
vendor X, the referrals to hospitals with that vendor increases by a rate of 0.4 percentage points. <br/>
This number we interpret as a proxy for the extent to which difficulties in cross vendor exchange <br/>
hinder patient care. However, our finding does not imply that difficulties in cross vendor <br/>

exchange can be entirely attributed to information blocking. One source of difficulties could be <br/>
explained by technological challenges where inherent software differences among vendors <br/>
hinder cross vendor exchange. An additional reason for this result could be attributed to <br/>
contractual agreements where vendors may incentivize their clients to exchange with other <br/>
clients having the same vendor. Nevertheless, to keep our estimates conservative, we reduced our <br/>
estimates by a factor of five. . Hence, we use 0.08 percentage points as the “ME of information <br/>
blocking.” <br/>

between $373 million and $933 million (including one-time and perpetual costs) with $569,000 <br/>
in cost savings. We estimate the total costs to ONC-ACBs to be between $213,000 and <br/>
$311,000. We estimate the government (ONC) costs to be between $44,800 and $269,000 while <br/>
saving $4,500.  In addition, to the above mentioned cost savings that are attributable to specific <br/>
stakeholder groups, we estimate to an additional cost savings of $6.8 million to $13.7 million to <br/>
all stakeholders affected by this proposal. We are unable to attribute these amounts to specific <br/>
stakeholder groups. <i> </i><br/>
(7) Total Annual Benefit Estimate <br/>
 <br/>
We estimate the total annual benefit for this proposed rule, based on the benefit estimates <br/>
outlined above, would range from $3.08 billion to $9.15 billion with an average annual benefit of <br/>
$6.1 billion. We attribute between $756 million and $3.8 billion in benefits to hospitals and <br/>

estimates include benefits attributed to the whole health care system, not just to the stakeholders <br/>

$2.7 billion to $8.2 billion with an average net benefit of $5.5 billion. We estimate the total <br/>
perpetual annual net benefit for this proposed rule (starting in year two), based on the estimates <br/>
outlined above, would range from $2.9 billion to $8.7 billion with an average net benefit of $5.8 <br/>
billion. <br/>

we are required to develop an accounting statement indicating the classification of the <br/>
expenditures associated with the provisions of the proposed rule. Monetary annual benefits are <br/>
presented as discounted flows using 3% and 7% factors in Table 29 below. We are not able to <br/>

3. Regulatory Flexibility Act <br/>
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires agencies to analyze options for regulatory <br/>
relief of small businesses if a rule has a significant impact on a substantial number of small <br/>
entities. The Small Business Administration (SBA) establishes the size of small businesses for <br/>
federal government programs based on average annual receipts or the average employment of a <br/>
firm.<a href="ONCs.html#616">191 </a>The entities that are likely to be directly affected by the requirements in this proposed <br/>
rule requirements are health IT developers. We note that the proposed reasonable and necessary <br/>
activities that do not constitute information blocking provide flexibilities and relief for health IT <br/>
developers of certified health IT, health information networks, health information exchanges, and <br/>
health care providers in relation to the information blocking provision of the Cures Act. These <br/>
proposed reasonable and necessary activities also take into account the potential burden on small <br/>
entities to meet these “exceptions” to information blocking, such as with considering the size and <br/>
                                                 <br/>
191 The SBA references that annual receipts means “total income” (or in the case of a sole proprietorship, “gross <br/>income”) plus “cost of goods sold” as these terms are defined and reported on Internal Revenue Service tax return <br/>forms. <br/>

resources of small entities when meeting security requirements to qualify for the “promoting the <br/>
security of electronic health information” exception. We refer readers to section VIII for our <br/>
information blocking-related proposals and welcome comments on their impacts on small <br/>
entities.    <br/>
While health IT developers that pursue certification of their health IT under the Program <br/>
represent a small segment of the overall information technology industry, we believe that many <br/>
health IT developers impacted by the requirements proposed in this proposed rule most likely fall <br/>
under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541511 “Custom <br/>
Computer Programming Services.” <a href="ONCs.html#617">192 </a>The SBA size standard associated with this NAICS code <br/>
is set at $27.5 million annual receipts or less. There is enough data generally available to <br/>
establish that between 75% and 90% of entities that are categorized under the NAICS code <br/>
541511 are under the SBA size standard. We also note that with the exception of aggregate <br/>
business information available through the U.S. Census Bureau and the SBA related to NAICS <br/>
code 541511, it appears that many health IT developers that pursue certification of their health IT <br/>
under the Program are privately held or owned and do not regularly, if at all, make their specific <br/>
annual receipts publicly available. As a result, it is difficult to locate empirical data related to <br/>
many of these health IT developers to correlate to the SBA size standard. However, although not <br/>
perfectly correlated to the size standard for NAICS code 541511, we do have information <br/>
indicating that over 60% of health IT developers that have had Complete EHRs and/or Health IT <br/>
Modules certified to the 2011 Edition have less than 51 employees.   <br/>

We estimate that the proposed requirements in this proposed rule would have effects on <br/>
health IT developers, some of which may be small entities, that have certified health IT or are <br/>
likely to pursue certification of their health IT under the Program. We believe, however, that we <br/>
have proposed the minimum amount of requirements necessary to accomplish our primary policy <br/>
goal of enhancing interoperability. Further, as discussed in section XIV.B of this RIA above, <br/>
there are no appropriate regulatory or non-regulatory alternatives that could be developed to <br/>
lessen the compliance burden associated with this proposed rule because many of the proposals <br/>
are derived directly form legislative mandates in the Cures Act. Additionally, we have attempted <br/>
to offset some of the burden imposed on health IT developers in this proposed rule with cost <br/>
saving proposals through deregulatory actions (<i>see</i> proposed section III). <br/>
We do not believe that the proposed requirements of this proposed rule would create a <br/>
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, but request comment on whether <br/>
there are small entities that we have not identified that may be affected in a significant way by <br/>
this proposed rule. Additionally, the Secretary proposes to certify that this proposed rule would <br/>
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <br/>
4. Executive Order 13132 - Federalism <br/>
Executive Order 13132 establishes certain requirements that an agency must meet when it <br/>
promulgates a proposed rule (and subsequent final rule) that imposes substantial direct <br/>
requirement costs on state and local governments, preempts state law, or otherwise has <br/>
federalism implications. Nothing in this proposed rule imposes substantial direct compliance <br/>
costs on state and local governments, preempts state law, or otherwise has federalism <br/>

implications. We are not aware of any state laws or regulations that are contradicted or impeded <br/>
by any of the proposals in this proposed rule. We welcome comments on this assessment.   <br/>
5. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 <br/>
Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires that agencies assess <br/>
anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule that imposes unfunded mandates on state, <br/>
local, and tribal governments or the private sector requiring spending in any one year of $100 <br/>
million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. The current inflation-adjusted statutory <br/>
threshold is approximately $150 million. While the estimated potential cost effects of this <br/>
proposed rule reach the statutory threshold, we do not believe this proposed rule imposes <br/>
unfunded mandates on state, local, and tribal governments or the private sector. We welcome <br/>
comments on these conclusions. <br/>
6.  Executive Order 13771 Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs <br/>
Executive Order 13771 (January 30, 2017) requires that the costs associated with <br/>
significant new regulations “to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of <br/>
existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations.” The Department believes that this <br/>
rule is a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866 which imposes costs, <br/>
and therefore is considered a regulatory action under Executive Order 13771. The Department <br/>
estimates that this rule generates $275 million in annualized costs at a 7% discount rate, <br/>
discounted relative to 2016, over a perpetual time horizon. <br/>
OMB reviewed this proposed rule.   <br/>

<b>Appendix: Pediatric Technical Worksheets  </b><br/>
These worksheets contain information on how each recommendation corresponds to the <br/>
Children’s EHR Format and to the existing or proposed new ONC certification criteria. We <br/>
invite readers to use these worksheets to inform public comment on the recommendations, the <br/>
inclusion of specific items from the Children’s EHR Format<a href="ONCs.html#699">193</a>, and the identified certification <br/>
criteria as they relate specifically to use cases for pediatric care and sites of service.   <br/>
We welcome public comment on the identified certification criteria for each recommendation. <br/>
Specifically, we seek comment for each recommendation on the following four broad questions: <br/>
•  <b>Q1.</b> What relevant gaps, barriers, safety concerns, and/or resources (including available best <br/>
practices, activities, and tools) may impact or support feasibility of the recommendation in <br/>
practice? <br/>
•  <b>Q2.</b> How can the effective use of IT support each recommendation as involves provider <br/>
training, establishing workflow, and other related safety and usability considerations? <br/>
•  <b>Q3.</b> Should any of the recommendations not be included?  <br/>
•  <b>Q4.</b> Should any of the functional criteria listed under the “Alignment with 2015 Edition <br/>
Certification Criteria” and the “Alignment with Proposed New or Updated Certification <br/>
Criteria” be removed as a correlated item to support any of the   recommendations?  <br/>
Commenters are encouraged to reference the specific recommendation number (110) with the <br/>
corresponding question number in their response.  For example, “Recommendation 1.  Q3.” <br/>
