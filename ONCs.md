**21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and
the ONC Health IT**  
**Certification Program**  
**AGENCY:** Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information
Technology (ONC),  
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  
**ACTION:** Proposed rule.  
**SUMMARY:** This proposed rule would implement certain provisions of
the 21st Century Cures  
Act, including conditions and maintenance of certification requirements
for health information  
technology (health IT) developers under the ONC Health IT Certification
Program (Program),  
the voluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric health
care providers, and reasonable  
and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking.
The implementation of these  
provisions would advance interoperability and support the access,
exchange, and use of  
electronic health information. The proposed rule would also modify the
2015 Edition health IT  
certification criteria and Program in additional ways to advance
interoperability, enhance health  
IT certification, and reduce burden and costs.  
**DATES:** To be assured consideration, written or electronic comments
must be received at one of  
the addresses provided below, no later than 5 p.m. on \[**INSERT DATE 60
DAYS AFTER THE**

and use of electronic health information; and address occurrences of
information blocking. This  
proposed rule would implement certain provisions of the Cures Act,
including Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification requirements for health information
technology (health IT)  
developers, the voluntary certification of health IT for use by
pediatric health providers, and  
reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information
blocking. In addition, the  
proposed rule would implement parts of section 4006(a) of the Cures Act
to support patient  
access to their electronic health information (EHI), such as making a
patient’s EHI more  
electronically accessible through the adoption of standards and
certification criteria and the  
implementation of information blocking policies that support patient
electronic access to their  
health information at no cost. Additionally, the proposed rule would
modify the 2015 Edition  
health IT certification criteria and ONC Health IT Certification Program
(Program) in other ways  
to advance interoperability, enhance health IT certification, and reduce
burden and costs.  
In addition to fulfilling the Cures Act’s requirements, the proposed
rule would contribute  
to fulfilling Executive Order (EO) 13813. The President issued EO 13813
on October 12, 2017,  
to promote health care choice and competition across the United States.
Section 1(c) of the EO,  
in relevant part, states that government rules affecting the United
States health care system  
should re-inject competition into the health care markets by lowering
barriers to entry and  
preventing abuses of market power. Section 1(c) also states that
government rules should  
improve access to and the quality of information that Americans need to
make informed health  
care decisions. For example, as mentioned above, the proposed rule
focuses on establishing  
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for several interoperability
purposes, including  
patient access to their health information without special effort. The
API approach also supports

health care providers having the sole authority and autonomy to
unilaterally permit connections  
to their health IT through certified API technology the health care
providers have acquired. In  
addition, the proposed rule provides ONC’s interpretation of the
information blocking definition  
as established in the Cures Act and the application of the information
blocking provision by  
identifying reasonable and necessary activities that would not
constitute information blocking.  
Many of these activities focus on improving patient and health care
provider access to electronic  
health information and promoting competition.  
*B. Summary of Major Provisions and Clarifications*  
1\. Deregulatory Actions for Previous Rulemakings  
Since the inception of the Program, we have aimed to implement and
administer the  
Program in the least burdensome manner that supports our policy goals.
Throughout the years,  
we have worked to improve the Program with a focus on ways to reduce
burden, offer flexibility  
to both developers and providers, and support innovation. This approach
has been consistent  
with the principles of Executive Order 13563 on Improving Regulation and
Regulatory Review  
(February 2, 2011), which instructs agencies to “determine whether any
\[agency\] regulations  
should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to make the
agency’s regulatory  
program more effective or less burdensome in achieving the regulatory
objectives.” To that end,  
we have historically, where feasible and appropriate, taken measures to
reduce burden within the  
Program and make the Program more effective, flexible, and
streamlined.  
ONC has reviewed and evaluated existing regulations to identify ways to
administratively  
reduce burden and implement deregulatory actions through guidance. In
this proposed rule, we  
also propose potential new deregulatory actions that will reduce burden
for health IT developers,

<span id="11"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **11** of **724**  
  
providers, and other stakeholders. We propose six deregulatory actions
in section III.B: (1)  
removal of a threshold requirement related to randomized surveillance
which allows ONC-  
Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs) more flexibility to identify
the right approach for  
surveillance actions, (2) removal of the 2014 Edition from the Code of
Federal Regulations  
(CFR), (3) removal of the ONC-Approved Accreditor (ONC-AA) from the
Program, (4) removal  
of certain 2015 Edition certification criteria, (5) removal of certain
Program requirements, and  
(6) recognition of relevant Food and Drug Administration certification
processes with a request  
for comment on the potential development of new processes for the
Program.  
2\. Updates to the 2015 Edition Certification Criteria  
This rule proposes to update the 2015 Edition by not only proposing
criteria for removal,  
but by proposing to revise and add new certification criteria that would
establish the capabilities  
and related standards and implementation specifications for the
certification of health IT.  
a. Adoption of the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)
as a  
Standard  
As part of ONC’s continued efforts to assure the availability of a
minimum baseline of  
data classes that could be commonly available for interoperable
exchange, we adopted the 2015  
Edition “Common Clinical Data Set” (CCDS) definition and used the CCDS
shorthand in several  
certification criteria. However, the CCDS definition also began to be
colloquially used for many  
different purposes. As the CCDS definition’s relevance grew outside of
its regulatory context, it  
became a symbolic and practical limit to the industry’s collective
interests to go beyond the  
CCDS data for access, exchange, and use. In addition, as we move further
towards value-based  
care, the need for the inclusion of additional data classes that go
beyond clinical data is

<span id="12"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **12** of **724**  
  
necessary. In order to advance interoperability, we propose to remove
the CCDS definition and  
its references from the 2015 Edition and replace it with the “United
States Core Data for  
Interoperability.” We propose to adopt the USCDI as a standard, naming
USCDI Version 1  
(USCDI v1) in § 170.213 and incorporating it by reference in § 170.299.
The USCDI standard, if  
adopted, would establish a set of data classes and constituent data
elements that would be  
required to be exchanged in support of interoperability nationwide. To
achieve the goals set forth  
in the Cures Act, ONC intends to establish and follow a predictable,
transparent, and  
collaborative process to expand the USCDI, including providing
stakeholders with the  
opportunity to comment on the USCDI’s expansion. Once the USCDI is
adopted in regulation  
naming USCDI v1, health IT developers would be allowed to take advantage
of a flexibility  
under the Maintenance of Certification real world testing requirements,
which we refer to as the  
“Standards Version Advancement Process” (described in section VII.B.5 of
this proposed rule).  
The Standards Version Advancement Process would permit health IT
developers to voluntarily  
implement and use a new version of an adopted standard, such as the
USCDI, so long as the  
newer version was approved by the National Coordinator through the
Standards Version  
Advancement Process for use in certification.  
  
  
b. Electronic Prescribing  
We propose to update the electronic prescribing (e-Rx) SCRIPT standard
in 45 CFR  
170.205(b) to NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071, which would result in a new e-Rx
standard eventually  
becoming the baseline for certification. We also propose to adopt a new
certification criterion in  
§ 170.315(b)(11) for e-Rx to reflect these updated proposals. ONC and
CMS have historically  
maintained complementary policies of maintaining aligned e-Rx and
medical history (MH)

electronic prescribing  
criterion permits use of the current Part D e-Rx and MH standards. This
proposal is made to  
ensure such alignment as CMS recently finalized its Part D standards to
NCPDP SCRIPT  
2017071 for e-RX and MH, effective January 1, 2020 (83 FR 16440). In
addition to continuing  
to reference the current transactions included in § 170.315(b)(3), in
keeping with CMS' final  
rule, we also propose to require all of the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071
standard transactions CMS  
adopted at 42 CFR 423.160(b)(2)(iv).  
c. Clinical Quality Measures – Report  
We propose to remove the HL7 Quality Reporting Document Architecture
(QRDA)  
standard requirements from the 2015 Edition “CQMs – report” criterion in
§ 170.315(c)(3) and,  
in their place, require Health IT Modules to support the CMS QRDA
Implementation Guide  
(IGs).[1](ONCs.html#13) This would reduce the burden for health IT
developers by only having to support one  
form of the QRDA standard rather than two forms (i.e., the HL7 and CMS
forms).  
d. Electronic Health Information Export  
We propose a new 2015 Edition certification criterion for “electronic
health information  
(EHI) export” in § **** 170.315(b)(10), which would replace the 2015
Edition “data export”  
certification criterion (§ **** 170.315(b)(6)) and become part of the
2015 Edition Base EHR  
definition. The proposed criterion supports situations in which we
believe that all EHI produced  
and electronically managed by a developer’s health IT should be made
readily available for  
export as a standard capability of certified health IT. Specifically,
this criterion would: (1) enable  
the export of EHI for a single patient upon a valid request from that
patient or a user on
the

patient’s behalf, and (2) support the export of EHI when a health care
provider chooses to  
transition or migrate information to another health IT system. This
criterion would also require  
that the export include the data format, made publicly available, to
facilitate the receiving health  
IT system’s interpretation and use of the EHI to the extent reasonably
practicable using the  
developer’s existing technology.  
This criterion provides developers with the ability to create innovative
export capabilities  
according to their systems and data practices. We do not propose that
the export must be  
executed according to any particular standard, but propose to require
that the export must be  
accompanied by the data format, including its structure and syntax, to
facilitate interpretation of  
the EHI therein. Overall, this new criterion is intended to provide
patients and health IT users,  
including providers, a means to efficiently export the entire electronic
health record for a single  
patient or all patients in a computable, electronic format.  
e. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)  
We propose to adopt a new API criterion in § 170.315(g)(10), which would
replace the  
“application access – data category request” certification criterion (§
170.315(g)(8)) and become  
part of the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition. This new “standardized API
for patient and  
population services” certification criterion would require the use of
Health Level 7 (HL7®) Fast  
Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®)
standards[2](ONCs.html#14)and several implementation  
specifications. The new criterion would focus on supporting two types of
API-enabled services:  
(1) services for which a single patient’s data is the focus and (2)
services for which multiple  
patients’ data are the focus.

f. Privacy and Security Transparency Attestations  
We propose to adopt two new privacy and security transparency
attestation certification  
criteria, which would identify whether certified health IT supports
encrypting authentication  
credentials and/or multi-factor authentication. In order to be issued a
certification, we propose to  
require that a Health IT Module developer attest to whether the Health
IT Module encrypts  
authentication credentials and whether the Health IT Module supports
multi-factor  
authentication. These criteria are not expected to place additional
burden on health IT developers  
since they do not require net new development or implementation to take
place in order to be  
met. However, certification to these proposed criteria would provide
increased transparency and  
potentially motivate health IT developers to encrypt authentication
credentials and support multi-  
factor authentication, which could help prevent exposure to unauthorized
persons/entities.  
  
g. Data Segmentation for Privacy and Consent Management  
In the 2015 Edition, we adopted two “data segmentation for privacy”
(DS4P) certification  
criteria, one for creating a summary record according to the DS4P
standard and one for receiving  
a summary record according to the DS4P standard. Certification to the
2015 Edition DS4P  
criteria focus on data segmentation only at the document level. As noted
in the 2015 Edition final  
rule (80 FR 62646) – and to our knowledge still an accurate assessment –
certification to these  
criteria is currently not required to meet the Certified EHR Technology
definition (CEHRT) or  
required by any other HHS program. Since the 2015 Edition final rule,
the health care industry  
has engaged in additional field testing and implementation of the DS4P
standard. In addition,  
stakeholders shared with ONC – through public forums, listening
sessions, and correspondence –  
that focusing certification on segmentation to only the document level
does not permit providers

<span id="16"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **16** of **724**  
  
the flexibility to address more granular segmentation needs. Therefore,
we propose to remove the  
current 2015 Edition DS4P criteria. We propose to replace these two
criteria with three new 2015  
Edition “DS4P” certification criteria (two for C-CDA and one for a
FHIR-based API) that would  
support a more granular approach to privacy tagging data consent
management for health  
information exchange supported by either the C-CDA- or FHIR-based
exchange standards.  
3\. Modifications to the ONC Health IT Certification Program  
We propose to make corrections to the 2015 Edition privacy and security
certification  
framework (80 FR 62705) and relevant regulatory provisions. These
corrections have already  
been incorporated in the relevant Certification Companion Guides
(CCGs).  
We propose new and revised principles of proper conduct (PoPC) for
ONC-Authorized  
Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs). We propose to clarify that the records
retention provision  
includes the “life of the edition” as well as after the retirement of an
edition related to the  
certification of Complete EHRs and Health IT Modules. We also propose to
revise the PoPC in §  
170.523(h) to clarify the basis for certification, including to permit a
certification decision to be  
based on an evaluation conducted by the ONC-ACB for Health IT Modules’
compliance with  
certification criteria by use of conformity methods approved by the
National Coordinator for  
Health Information Technology (National Coordinator). We also propose to
update § 170.523(h)  
to require ONC-ACBs to accept test results from any ONC-ATL that is in
good standing under  
the Program and is compliant with its ISO 17025 accreditation
requirements. We believe these  
proposed new and revised PoPCs would provide necessary clarifications
for ONC-ACBs and  
would promote stability among the ONC-ACBs. We also propose to update §
170.523(k) to  
broaden the requirements beyond just the Medicare and Medicaid
Electronic Health Record

other necessary clarifications.  
We propose to revise a PoPC for ONC-ATLs. We propose to clarify that the
records  
retention provision includes the “life of the edition” as well as after
the retirement of an edition  
related to the certification of Complete EHRs and Health IT Modules.  
4\. Health IT for the Care Continuum  
Section 4001(b) of the Cures Act includes two provisions related to
supporting health IT  
across the care continuum. The first instructs the National Coordinator
to encourage, keep or  
recognize through existing authorities, the voluntary certification of
health IT for use in medical  
specialties and sites of service where more technological advancement or
integration is needed.  
The second outlines a provision related to the voluntary certification
of health IT for use by  
pediatric health providers to support the health care of children. These
provisions align closely  
with ONC’s core purpose to promote interoperability to support care
coordination, patient  
engagement, and health care quality improvement initiatives. Advancing
health IT that promotes  
and supports patient care when and where it is needed continues to be a
primary goal of the  
Program. This means health IT should support patient populations,
specialized care, transitions  
of care, and practice settings across the care continuum.  
ONC has explored how we might work with the health IT industry and with
specialty  
organizations to collaboratively develop and promote health IT that
supports medical specialties  
and sites of service. Over time, ONC has taken steps to make the Program
modular, more open  
and accessible to different types of health IT, and able to advance
functionality that is generally  
applicable to a variety of care and practice settings. Specific to the
provisions in the Cures Act to

<span id="18"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **18** of **724**  
  
support providers of health care for children, we considered a wide
range of factors. These  
include: the evolution of health IT across the care continuum, the costs
and benefits associated  
with health IT, the potential regulatory burden and compliance
timelines, and the need to help  
advance health IT that benefits multiple medical specialties and sites
of service involved in the  
care of children. In consideration of these factors, and to advance
implementation of Sections  
4001(b) of the Cures Act specific to pediatric care, we held a listening
session where  
stakeholders could share their clinical knowledge and technical
expertise in pediatric care and  
pediatric sites of service. Through the information learned at this
listening session and our  
analysis of the health IT landscape for pediatric settings, we have
identified existing 2015  
Edition criteria, as well as new and revised 2015 Edition criteria
proposed in this rule, that we  
believe could benefit providers of pediatric care and pediatric
settings. In this proposed rule, we  
seek comment on our analysis and the correlated certification criteria
that we believe would  
support the health care of children.  
We also recognize the significance of the opioid epidemic confronting
our nation and the  
importance of helping to support the health IT needs of health care
providers committed to  
preventing inappropriate access to prescription opioids and to providing
safe, appropriate  
treatment. We believe health IT offers promising strategies to help
assist medical specialties and  
sites of services impacted by the opioid epidemic. Therefore, we request
public comment on how  
our existing Program requirements and the proposals in this rulemaking
may support use cases  
related to Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) prevention and treatment and if
there are additional areas  
that ONC should consider for effective implementation of health IT to
help address OUD  
prevention and treatment.

5\. Conditions and Maintenance of Certification  
We propose to establish certain Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification  
requirements for health IT developers based on the conditions and
maintenance of certification  
requirements outlined in section 4002 of the Cures Act. We propose an
approach whereby the  
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification express both initial
requirements for health IT  
developers and their certified Health IT Module(s) as well as ongoing
requirements that must be  
met by both health IT developers and their certified Health IT Module(s)
under the Program. In  
this regard, we propose to implement the Cures Act Conditions of
Certification with further  
specificity as it applies to the Program and propose to implement any
accompanying  
Maintenance of Certification requirements as standalone requirements to
ensure that not only are  
the Conditions of Certification met, but that they are continually being
met through the  
Maintenance of Certification requirements. For ease of reference and to
distinguish from other  
conditions, we propose to capitalize “Conditions of Certification” and
“Maintenance of  
Certification” when referring to Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification requirements  
established under the Cures Act.  
*Information Blocking*  
The Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and
Maintenance of  
Certification under the Program, not take any action that constitutes
information blocking as  
defined in section 3022(a) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). We
propose to establish this  
information blocking Condition of Certification in § 170.401. The
Condition of Certification  
would prohibit any health IT developer under the Program from taking any
action that constitutes  
information blocking as defined by section 3022(a) of the PHSA and
proposed in § 171.103.

<span id="20"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **20** of **724**  
  
  
*Assurances*  
Section 3001(c)(5)(D)(ii) of the **** Cures Act requires that a health
IT developer, as a  
Condition of Certification under the Program, provide assurances to the
Secretary that, unless for  
legitimate purposes specified by the Secretary, the developer will not
take any action that  
constitutes information blocking as defined in section 3022(a) of the
PHSA, or any other action  
that may inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of EHI. We
propose to implement this  
provision through several Conditions of Certification and accompanying
Maintenance  
requirements, which are set forth in proposed § 170.402. We also propose
to establish more  
specific Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements to
provide assurances that a  
health IT developer does not take any other action that may inhibit the
appropriate exchange,  
access, and use of EHI. These proposed requirements serve to provide
further clarity under the  
Program as to how health IT developers can provide such broad assurances
with more specific  
actions.  
*Communications*  
As a Condition and Maintenance of Certification under the Program, the
Cures Act  
requires that health IT developers do not prohibit or restrict
communications about certain  
aspects of the performance of health IT and the developers’ related
business practices. We  
propose that developers will be permitted to impose certain kinds of
limited prohibitions and  
restrictions that we believe strike a reasonable balance between the
need to promote open  
communication about health IT and related developer business practices
and the need to protect  
the legitimate interests of health IT developers and other entities.
However, certain narrowly-  
defined types of communications—such as communications required by law,
made to a

government agency, or made to a defined category of safety
organization—would receive  
“unqualified protection,” meaning that developers would be absolutely
prohibited from imposing  
any prohibitions or restrictions on such protected communications.  
We propose that to maintain compliance with this Condition of
Certification, a health IT  
developer must not impose or enforce any contractual requirement or
legal right that contravenes  
this Condition of Certification. Furthermore, we propose that if a
health IT developer has  
contracts/agreements in existence that contravene this condition, the
developer must notify all  
affected customers or other persons or entities that the prohibition or
restriction will not be  
enforced by the health IT developer. Going forward, health IT developers
would be required to  
amend their contracts/agreements to remove or make void the provisions
that contravene this  
Condition of Certification within a reasonable period of time, but not
later than two years from  
the effective date of a subsequent final rule for this proposed rule.  
*Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)*  
The Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification includes several key
phrases (including,  
for example, “without special effort”) and requirements for health IT
developers that indicate the  
Cures Act’s focus on the technical requirements as well as the actions
and practices of health IT  
developers in implementing the certified API. In section VII.B.4 of the
preamble, we outline our  
proposals to implement the Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification.
These proposals include  
new standards, new implementation specifications, a new certification
criterion, as well as  
detailed Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements.  
*Real World Testing*

<span id="22"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **22** of **724**  
  
The Cures Act adds a new Condition and Maintenance of Certification
requirement that  
health IT developers successfully test the real world use of the
technology for interoperability in  
the type of setting in which such technology would be marketed. In this
proposed rule, we  
outline what successful “real world testing” means for the purpose of
this Condition of  
Certification, as well as proposed Maintenance requirements—including
standards updates for  
widespread and continued interoperability.  
We propose to limit the applicability of this Condition of Certification
to health IT  
developers with Health IT Modules certified to one or more 2015 Edition
certification criteria  
focused on interoperability and data exchange specified in section
VII.B.5. We propose  
Maintenance of Certification requirements that would require health IT
developers to submit  
publicly available annual real world testing plans as well as annual
real world testing results for  
certified health IT products focused on interoperability. We also
propose a Maintenance of  
Certification flexibility we have named the Standards Version
Advancement Process, under  
which health IT developers with health IT certified to the criteria
specified for interoperability  
and data exchange would have the option to update their health IT to a
more advanced version(s)  
of the standard(s) or implementation specification(s) included in the
criteria once such versions  
are approved by the National Coordinator through the Standards Version
Advancement Process  
for use in health IT certified under the Program. Similarly, we propose
that health IT developers  
presenting new health IT for certification to one of the criteria
specified in Section VII.B.5  
would have the option to certify to a National Coordinator-approved more
advanced version of  
the adopted standards or implementation specifications included in the
criteria. We propose that  
health IT developers voluntarily opting to avail themselves of the
Standards Version

Advancement Process must address their planned and actual timelines for
implementation and  
rollout of standards updates in their annual real world testing plans
and real world testing results  
submissions. We also propose that health IT developers of products with
existing certifications  
who plan to avail themselves of the Standards Version Advancement
Process flexibility notify  
both their ONC-ACB and their affected customers of their intention and
plans to update their  
certified health IT and its anticipated impact on their existing
certified health IT and customers,  
specifically including but not limited to whether, and if so for how
long, the health IT developer  
intends to continue to support the certificate for the health IT
certified to the prior version of the  
standard.  
We propose a new PoPC for ONC-ACBs that would require ONC-ACBs to review
and  
confirm that applicable health IT developers submit real world testing
plans and real world  
results in accordance with our proposals. Once completeness is
confirmed, ONC-ACBs would  
upload the plans and results via hyperlinks to the Certified Health IT
Product List (CHPL). We  
propose to revise the PoPC in § 170.523(m) to require ONC-ACBs to
collect, no less than  
quarterly, all updates successfully made to standards in certified
health IT pursuant to the  
developers having voluntarily opted to avail themselves of the Standards
Version Advancement  
Process flexibility under the real world testing Condition of
Certification. We propose in §  
170.523(t), a new PoPC for ONC-ACBs requiring them to ensure that
developers seeking to take  
advantage of the Standards Version Advancement Process flexibility in §
170.405(b)(5) comply  
with the applicable requirements.

The Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and
Maintenance of  
Certification under the Program, provide to the Secretary an attestation
to all the Conditions of  
Certification specified in the Cures Act, except for the “EHR reporting
criteria submission”  
Condition of Certification. We propose to implement the Cures Act
“attestations” Condition of  
Certification in § 170.406. Health IT developers would attest twice a
year to compliance with the  
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements (except for the
EHR reporting criteria  
requirement, which would be metrics reporting requirements separately
implemented through a  
future rulemaking). The 6-month attestation period we propose in §
170.406(b)(2) would  
properly balance the need to support appropriate enforcement with the
attestation burden placed  
on health IT developers. In this regard, the proposed rule includes
provisions to make the process  
as simple and efficient for health IT developers as possible (e.g.,
14-day grace period, web-based  
form submissions, and attestation alert reminders).  
  
We propose that attestations would be submitted to ONC-ACBs on behalf of
ONC and  
the Secretary. We propose a new PoPC in § 170.523(q) that an ONC-ACB
must review and  
submit the health IT developers’ attestations to ONC. ONC would then
make the attestations  
publicly available through the CHPL.  
  
*EHR Reporting Criteria Submission*  
  
The Cures Act specifies that health IT developers be required, as a
Condition and  
Maintenance of Certification under the Program, to submit reporting
criteria on certified health  
IT in accordance with the EHR reporting program established under
section 3009A of the PHSA,  
as added by the Cures Act. We have not yet established an EHR reporting
program. Once ONC

establishes such program, we will undertake rulemaking to propose and
implement the  
associated Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement(s) for
health IT developers.  
*Enforcement*  
*  
*  
Section 4002 of the Cures Act adds Program requirements aimed at
addressing health IT  
developer actions and business practices through the Conditions and
Maintenance of  
Certification requirements, which expands the current focus of the
Program requirements beyond  
the certified health IT itself. Equally important, section 4002 also
provides that the Secretary of  
HHS may encourage compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification  
requirements and take action to discourage noncompliance. We, therefore,
propose a general  
enforcement approach to encourage consistent compliance with the
requirements. The proposed  
rule outlines a corrective action process for ONC to review potential or
known instances where a  
Condition or Maintenance of Certification requirement has not been or is
not being met by a  
health IT developer under the Program. We propose, with minor
modifications, to utilize the  
processes previously established for ONC direct review of certified
health IT and codified in §§  
170.580 and 170.581 for the enforcement of the Conditions and
Maintenance of Certification  
requirements. Where noncompliance is identified, our first priority
would be to work with the  
health IT developer to remedy the matter through a corrective action
process. However, we  
propose that, under certain circumstances, ONC may ban a health IT
developer from the Program  
or terminate the certification of one or more of its Health IT
Modules.

300jj–52, “the  
information blocking provision”), which defines conduct by health care
providers, and health IT

developers of certified health IT, exchanges, and networks that
constitutes information blocking.  
Section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA defines information blocking in broad
terms, while section  
3022(a)(3) authorizes and charges the Secretary to identify reasonable
and necessary activities  
that do not constitute information blocking (section 3022(a)(3) of the
PHSA).  
  
We identify several reasonable and necessary activities as exceptions to
the information  
blocking definition, each of which we propose would not constitute
information blocking for  
purposes of section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA. The exceptions would extend
to certain activities  
that interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI but that may be
reasonable and necessary  
if certain conditions are met.  
In developing the proposed exceptions, we were guided by three
overarching policy  
considerations. First, the exceptions would be limited to certain
activities that clearly advance the  
aims of the information blocking provision; promoting public confidence
in health IT  
infrastructure by supporting the privacy and security of EHI, and
protecting patient safety; and  
promoting competition and innovation in health IT and its use to provide
health care services to  
consumers. Second, each exception is intended to address a significant
risk that regulated  
individuals and entities (i.e., health care providers, health IT
developers of certified health IT,  
health information networks, and health information exchanges) will not
engage in these  
reasonable and necessary activities because of potential uncertainty
regarding whether they  
would be considered information blocking. Third, and last, each
exception is intended to be  
tailored, through appropriate conditions, so that it is limited to the
reasonable and necessary  
activities that it is designed to exempt.

The seven proposed exceptions are set forth in section VIII.D below. The
first three  
exceptions, set forth in VIII.D.1-D.3 address activities that are
reasonable and necessary to  
promote public confidence in the use of health IT and the exchange of
EHI. These exceptions are  
intended to protect patient safety; promote the privacy of EHI; and
promote the security of EHI.  
The next three exceptions, set forth in VIII.D.4-D.6, address activities
that are reasonable and  
necessary to promote competition and consumer welfare. These exceptions
would allow for the  
recovery of costs reasonably incurred; excuse an actor from responding
to requests that are  
infeasible; and permit the licensing of interoperability elements on
reasonable and non-  
discriminatory terms. The last exception, set forth in VIII.D.7,
addresses activities that are  
reasonable and necessary to promote the performance of health IT. This
proposed exception  
recognizes that actors may make health IT temporarily unavailable for
maintenance or  
improvements that benefit the overall performance and usability of
health IT.  
  
To qualify for any of these exceptions, we propose that an individual or
entity would, for  
each relevant practice and at all relevant times, have to satisfy all of
the applicable conditions of  
the exception. Additionally, we propose (in section VIII.C of this
preamble) to define or interpret  
terms that are present in section 3022 of the PHSA (such as the types of
individuals and entities  
covered by the information blocking provision). We also propose certain
new terms and  
definitions that are necessary to implement the information blocking
provisions. We propose to  
codify the proposed exceptions and other information blocking proposals
in a new part of title 45  
of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 171.

Executive Orders 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30,
1993) and  
13563 on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (February 2, 2011)
direct agencies to  
assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and,
if regulation is necessary, to  
select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic,  
environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts,
and equity). A regulatory  
impact analysis (RIA) must be prepared for major rules with economically
significant effects  
($100 million or more in any one year). OMB has determined that this
proposed rule is an  
economically significant rule as the potential costs associated with
this proposed rule could be  
greater than $100 million per year. Accordingly, we have prepared an RIA
that to the best of our  
ability presents the costs and benefits of this proposed rule.  
We have estimated the potential monetary costs and benefits of this
proposed rule for  
health IT developers, health care providers, patients, ONC-ACBs,
ONC-ATLs, and the federal  
government (i.e., ONC), and have broken those costs and benefits out
into the following  
categories: (1) deregulatory actions (no associated costs); (2) updates
to the updates to the 2015  
Edition health IT certification criteria; (3) Conditions and Maintenance
of Certification for a  
health IT developer; (4) oversight for the Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification; and (5)  
information blocking.  
We note that we have rounded all estimates to the nearest dollar and all
estimates are  
expressed in 2016 dollars as it is the most recent data available to
address all cost and benefit  
estimates consistently. We also note that we did not have adequate data
to quantify some of the  
costs and benefits within this RIA. In those situations, we have
described the qualitative costs

and benefits of our proposals; however, such qualitative costs and
benefits have not been  
accounted for in the monetary cost and benefit totals below.  
We estimate that the total annual cost for this proposed rule for the
first year after it is  
finalized (including one-time costs), based on the cost estimates
outlined above and throughout  
this RIA, would, on average, range from $365 million to $919 million
with an average annual  
cost of $642 million. We estimate that the total perpetual cost for this
proposed rule (starting in  
year two), based on the cost estimates outlined above, would, on
average, range from $228  
million to $452 million with an average annual cost of $340 million.

We estimate the total annual benefit for this proposed rule would range
from $3.08  
billion to $9.15 billion with an average annual benefit of $6.1 billion.

We estimate the total annual **net** benefit for this proposed rule for
the first year after it is  
finalized (including one-time costs), based on the cost and benefit
estimates outlined above,  
would range from $2.7 billion to $8.2 billion with an average net
benefit of $5.5 billion. We  
estimate the total perpetual annual net benefit for this proposed rule
(starting in year two), based  
on the cost-benefit estimates outlined above, would range from $2.9
billion to $8.7 billion with  
an average net benefit of $5.8 billion.  
**II. Background**  
*A. Statutory Basis*  
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
(HITECH) Act,  
Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American
Recovery and Reinvestment  
Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111–5), was enacted on February
17, 2009. The  
HITECH Act amended the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and created

Information Technology and Quality” (Title XXX) to improve health care
quality, safety, and  
efficiency through the promotion of health IT and electronic health
information (EHI) exchange.  
The Cures Act was enacted on December 13, 2016, to accelerate the
discovery,  
development, and delivery of 21st century cures, and for other purposes.
The Cures Act, through  
Title IV – Delivery, amended the HITECH Act (Title XIII of Division A of
Pub. L. 111-5) by  
modifying or adding certain provisions to the PHSA relating to health
IT.  
1\. Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification
Criteria  
  
The HITECH Act established two new federal advisory committees, the HIT
Policy  
Committee (HITPC) and the HIT Standards Committee (HITSC). Each was
responsible for  
advising the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
(National Coordinator) on  
different aspects of standards, implementation specifications, and
certification criteria.  
Section 3002 of the Cures Act amended the PHSA by replacing the HITPC
and HITSC  
with one committee, the Health Information Technology Advisory Committee
(HIT Advisory  
Committee or HITAC). Section 3002(a) establishes that the HITAC shall
advise and recommend  
to the National Coordinator on different aspects of standards,
implementation specifications, and  
certification criteria, relating to the implementation of a health IT
infrastructure, nationally and  
locally, that advances the electronic access, exchange, and use of
health information. Further  
described in section 3002(b)(1)(A) of the PHSA, this includes providing
to the National  
Coordinator recommendations on a policy framework to advance
interoperable health IT  
infrastructure, updating recommendations to the policy framework, and
making new  
recommendations, as appropriate. Section 3002(b)(2)(A) identifies that
in general, the HITAC  
shall recommend to the National Coordinator for purposes of adoption
under section 3004,

standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria and
an order of priority for the  
development, harmonization, and recognition of such standards,
specifications, and certification  
criteria. Like the process previously required of the former HITPC and
HITSC, the HITAC will  
develop a schedule for the assessment of policy recommendations for the
Secretary to publish in  
the **Federal Register**.  
Section 3004 of the PHSA identifies a process for the adoption of health
IT standards,  
implementation specifications, and certification criteria and authorizes
the Secretary to adopt  
such standards, implementation specifications, and certification
criteria. As specified in section  
3004(a)(1), the Secretary is required, in consultation with
representatives of other relevant  
federal agencies, to jointly review standards, implementation
specifications, and certification  
criteria endorsed by the National Coordinator under section 3001(c) and
subsequently determine  
whether to propose the adoption of any grouping of such standards,
implementation  
specifications, or certification criteria. The Secretary is required to
publish all determinations in  
the **Federal Register**.  
Section 3004(b)(3) of the PHSA titled, Subsequent Standards Activity,
provides that the  
Secretary shall adopt additional standards, implementation
specifications, and certification  
criteria as necessary and consistent with the schedule published by the
HITAC. We consider this  
provision in the broader context of the HITECH Act and Cures Act to
grant the Secretary the  
authority and discretion to adopt standards, implementation
specifications, and certification  
criteria that have been recommended by the HITAC and endorsed by the
National Coordinator,  
as well as other appropriate and necessary health IT standards,
implementation specifications,  
and certification criteria.

2\. Health IT Certification Program(s)  
Under the HITECH Act, section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA provides the
National  
Coordinator with the authority to establish a certification program or
programs for the voluntary  
certification of health IT. Specifically, section 3001(c)(5)(A)
specifies that the National  
Coordinator, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute
of Standards and  
Technology (NIST), shall keep or recognize a program or programs for the
voluntary  
certification of health IT that is in compliance with applicable
certification criteria adopted under  
this subtitle (i.e., certification criteria adopted by the Secretary
under section 3004 of the PHSA).  
The certification program(s) must also include, as appropriate, testing
of the technology in  
accordance with section 13201(b) of the HITECH Act. Overall, section
13201(b) of the HITECH  
Act requires that with respect to the development of standards and
implementation  
specifications, the Director of NIST shall support the establishment of
a conformance testing  
infrastructure, including the development of technical test beds. The
HITECH Act also indicates  
that the development of this conformance testing infrastructure may
include a program to  
accredit independent, non-federal laboratories to perform testing.  
Section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA was amended by the Cures Act, which
instructs the  
National Coordinator to encourage, keep, or recognize, through existing
authorities, the  
voluntary certification of health IT under the Program for use in
medical specialties and sites of  
service for which no such technology is available or where more
technological advancement or  
integration is needed. Section 3001(c)(5)(C)(iii) identifies that the
Secretary, in consultation with  
relevant stakeholders, shall make recommendations for the voluntary
certification of health IT  
for use by pediatric health providers to support the care of children,
as well as adopt certification

criteria under section 3004 to support the voluntary certification of
health IT for use by pediatric  
health providers. The Cures Act further amended section 3001(c)(5) of
the PHSA by adding  
section 3001(c)(5)(D), which provides the Secretary with the authority,
through notice and  
comment rulemaking, to require conditions and maintenance of
certification requirements for the  
Program.  
*B. Regulatory History*  
The Secretary issued an interim final rule with request for comments (75
FR 2014, Jan.  
13, 2010), which adopted an initial set of standards, implementation
specifications, and  
certification criteria. On March 10, 2010, ONC published a proposed rule
(75 FR 11328) that  
proposed both a temporary and permanent certification program for the
purposes of testing and  
certifying health IT. A final rule establishing the temporary
certification program was published  
on June 24, 2010 (75 FR 36158) and a final rule establishing the
permanent certification program  
was published on January 7, 2011 (76 FR 1262). ONC issued multiple
rulemakings since these  
initial rulemaking to update standards, implementation specifications,
and certification criteria  
and the certification program, a history of which can be found in the
final rule titled, “2015  
Edition Health Information (Health IT) Certification Criteria, 2015
Edition Base Electronic  
Health Record (EHR) Definition, and ONC Health IT Certification Program
Modifications”  
(Oct. 16, 2015, 80 FR 62602) (“2015 Edition final rule”). A correction
notice was published for  
the 2015 Edition final rule on December 11, 2015 (80 FR 76868) to
correct preamble and  
regulatory text errors and clarify requirements of the Common Clinical
Data Set (CCDS), the  
2015 Edition privacy and security certification framework, and the
mandatory disclosures for  
health IT developers.

<span id="34"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **34** of **724**  
  
The 2015 Edition final rule established a new edition of certification
criteria (“2015  
Edition health IT certification criteria” or “2015 Edition”) and a new
2015 Edition Base EHR  
definition. The 2015 Edition established the capabilities and specified
the related standards and  
implementation specifications that CEHRT would need to include to, at a
minimum, support the  
achievement of “meaningful use” by eligible clinicians, eligible
hospitals, and critical access  
hospitals under the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs (EHR
Incentive Programs)  
(now referred to as the Promoting Interoperability
Programs)[3](ONCs.html#34) when the 2015 Edition is required  
for use under these and other programs referencing the CEHRT definition.
The 2015 Edition  
final rule also made changes to the Program. The final rule adopted a
proposal to change the  
Program’s name to the “ONC Health IT Certification Program” from the ONC
*HIT* Certification  
Program, modified the Program to make it more accessible to other types
of health IT beyond  
EHR technology and for health IT that supports care and practice
settings beyond the ambulatory  
and inpatient settings, and adopted new and revised Principles of Proper
Conduct (PoPC) for  
ONC-ACBs.  
After issuing a proposed rule on March 2, 2016 (81 FR 11056), ONC
published a final  
rule titled, “ONC Health IT Certification Program: Enhanced Oversight
and Accountability” (81  
FR 72404) (“EOA final rule”) on October 19, 2016. The final rule
finalized modifications and  
new requirements under the Program, including provisions related to
ONC’s role in the Program.  
The final rule created a regulatory framework for ONC’s direct review of
health IT certified  
under the Program, including, when necessary, requiring the correction
of non-conformities  
found in health IT certified under the Program and suspending and
terminating certifications

forth processes for  
ONC to authorize and oversee accredited testing laboratories under the
Program. In addition, it  
includes provisions for expanded public availability of certified health
IT surveillance results.  
**III. Deregulatory Actions for Previous Rulemakings**  
*A. Background*  
1\. History of Burden Reduction and Flexibility  
Since the inception of the ONC Health IT Certification Program
(Program), we have  
aimed to implement and administer the Program in the least burdensome
manner that supports  
our policy goals. Throughout the years, we have worked to improve the
Program with a focus on  
ways to reduce burden, offer flexibility to both developers and
providers, and support innovation.  
This approach has been consistent with the principles of Executive Order
13563 on Improving  
Regulation and Regulatory Review (February 2, 2011), which instructs
agencies to “determine  
whether any \[agency\] regulations should be modified, streamlined,
expanded, or repealed so as  
to make the agency’s regulatory program more effective or less
burdensome in achieving the  
regulatory objectives.” To that end, we have historically, where
feasible and appropriate, taken  
measures to reduce burden within the Program and make the Program more
effective, flexible,  
and streamlined.  
For example, in the 2014 Edition final rule (77 FR 54164), we revised
the certified  
electronic health record technology (CEHRT) definition to provide
flexibility and create  
regulatory efficiencies by narrowing required functionality to a core
set of capabilities (i.e., the  
Base EHR definition) plus the additional capabilities each eligible
clinician, eligible hospital, and  
critical access hospital needed to successfully achieve the applicable
objective and measures

under the EHR Incentive Programs (now referred to as the Promoting
Interoperability Programs).  
ONC has also supported more efficient testing and certification methods
and reduced regulatory  
burden through the adoption of a gap certification policy. As explained
in the 2014 Edition final  
rule (77 FR 54254) and the 2015 Edition final rule (80 FR 62681), where
applicable, gap  
certification allows for the use of a previously certified health IT
product’s test results to  
certification criteria identified as unchanged. Developers have been
able to use gap certification  
for the more efficient certification of their health IT when updating
from the 2011 Edition to the  
2014 Edition and from the 2014 Edition to the 2015 Edition.  
ONC introduced further means to reduce regulatory burden, increase
regulatory  
flexibility, and promote innovation in the 2014 Edition Release 2 final
rule [(79
FR 54430)](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-54430). The  
2014 Edition Release 2 final rule established a set of optional 2014
Edition certification criteria  
that provided flexibility and alternative certification pathways for
health IT developers and  
providers based on their specific circumstances. The 2014 Edition
Release 2 final rule also  
simplified the Program by discontinuing the use of the “Complete EHR”
certification concept  
beginning with the 2015 Edition (79 FR 54443).  
In the 2015 Edition final rule, we did not “carry forward” certain 2014
Edition  
certification criteria into the 2015 Edition, such as the “image
results,” “patient list creation,” and  
“electronic medication administration record” criteria. We determined
that these criteria did not  
advance functionality or support interoperability (80 FR 62682-84). We
also did not require all  
health IT to be certified to the “meaningful use measurement”
certification criteria for  
“automated numerator recording” and “automated measure calculation” (80
FR 62605), which  
had been previously required for the 2014 Edition. Based on stakeholder
feedback and Program

administration observations, we also permitted testing efficiencies for
the 2015 Edition  
“automated numerator recording” and “automated measure calculation”
criteria by removing the  
live demonstration requirement of recording data and generating reports.
Health IT developers  
may now self-test their Health IT Modules(s) and submit the resulting
reports to the ONC-  
Authorized Testing Laboratory (ONC-ATL) to verify compliance with the
criterion.[4](ONCs.html#37) In order to  
further reduce burden for health IT developers, we adopted a simpler,
straight-forward approach  
to privacy and security certification requirements, which clarified
which requirements are  
applicable to each criterion within the regulatory functional areas (80
FR 62605).  
2\. Executive Orders 13771 and 13777  
On January 30, 2017, the President issued Executive Order 13771 on
Reducing  
Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which requires agencies to
identify deregulatory  
actions. This order was followed by Executive Order 13777, titled
“Enforcing the Regulatory  
Reform Agenda” (February 24, 2017). Executive Order 13777 provides
further direction on  
implementing regulatory reform by identifying a process by which
agencies must review and  
evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations for repeal or
simplification.  
In order to implement these regulatory reform initiatives and policies,
over the past year  
ONC reviewed and evaluated existing regulations. During our review, we
sought to identify  
ways to further reduce administrative burden, to implement deregulatory
actions through  
guidance, and to propose potential new deregulatory actions in this
proposed rule that will reduce  
burden for health IT developer, providers, and other
stakeholders.

On August 21, 2017, ONC issued *Relied Upon Software Program
Guidance*.[5](ONCs.html#38) Health IT  
developers are permitted to use “relied upon software” (76 FR 1276) to
demonstrate compliance  
with certification criteria adopted at 45 CFR Part 170, Subpart C.
Historically, in cases where a  
Health IT Module is paired with multiple “relied upon software” products
for the same  
capability, health IT developers were required to demonstrate compliance
for the same  
certification criterion with each of those “relied upon software”
products in order for the  
products to be listed on the Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL).
With the issued guidance,  
health IT developers may now demonstrate compliance with only one
“relied upon software”  
product for a criterion/capability. Once the health IT developer
demonstrates compliance with a  
minimum of one “relied upon software” product, the developer can have
multiple, additional  
“relied upon software” products for the same criterion/capability listed
on the CHPL  
(https://chpl.healthit.gov/). This approach reduces burden for health IT
developers, ONC-ATLs,  
and ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs).  
On September 21, 2017, ONC reduced the overall burden for testing health
IT to the  
2015 Edition.[6](ONCs.html#38)ONC reviewed the 2015 Edition test
procedures, which identify minimum testing  
requirements ONC-ATLs must evaluate during testing. ONC changed 30 of
the 2015 Edition test  
procedures to attestation only (i.e., a “yes” self-declaration by the
health IT developer that their  
product has capabilities conformant with those specified in the
associated certification  
criterion/criteria).[7](ONCs.html#38) This deregulatory action reduced
burden and costs program-wide, while still  
maintaining the Program’s high level of integrity and assurances. Health
IT developers now
have

reduced preparation and testing costs for testing to these criteria.
Specifically, the cost savings  
for health IT developers have been estimated between $8.34 and $9.26
million. ONC-ATLs also  
benefit by having more time and resources to focus on tool-based testing
(for interoperability-  
oriented criteria) and being responsive to any retesting requirements
that may arise from ONC-  
ACB surveillance activities. Furthermore, providers and users of
certified health IT do not lose  
confidence in the Program because this burden reduction effort in no way
alters the expectations  
of conformance and responsibilities of Program participants. Health IT
developers are still  
required to meet certification criteria requirements and maintain their
products’ conformance to  
the full scope of the associated criteria, including when implemented in
the field and in  
production use. Similarly, ONC and ONC-ACBs continue to conduct
surveillance activities and  
respond to end-user complaints.  
*B. Proposed Deregulatory Actions*  
**  
We propose six deregulatory actions below. We welcome comments on these
potential  
deregulatory actions and any other potential deregulatory actions we
should consider. We also  
refer readers to section XIV (Regulatory Impact Analysis) of this
proposed rule for a discussion  
of the estimated cost savings from these proposed deregulatory
actions.  
  
1\. Removal of Randomized Surveillance Requirements  
ONC-ACBs are required to conduct surveillance of certified health IT
under the Program  
to ensure that health IT continues to conform and function as required
by the full scope of the  
certification requirements. Surveillance is categorized as either
reactive surveillance (for  
example, complaint-based surveillance) or randomized surveillance,
which, by regulation,  
requires ONC-ACBs to proactively surveil 2% of the certificates they
issue annually. On

September 21, 2017, we exercised enforcement discretion with respect to
the implementation of  
randomized surveillance by ONC-ACBs.[8](ONCs.html#40)Consistent with
this exercise of enforcement  
discretion, we now propose to eliminate certain regulatory randomized
surveillance  
requirements.  
We propose to revise § 170.556(c) by changing the requirement that
ONC-ACBs *must*  
conduct in-the-field, randomized surveillance to specify that ONC-ACBs
*may* conduct in-the-  
field, randomized surveillance. We further propose to remove
§ 170.556(c)(2), which specifies  
that ONC-ACBs must conduct randomized surveillance for a minimum of 2%
of certified health  
IT products per year. We also propose to remove the requirements in §
170.556(c)(5) regarding  
the exclusion and exhaustion of selected locations for randomized
surveillance. Additionally, we  
propose to remove the requirements in § 170.556(c)(6) regarding the
consecutive selection of  
certified health IT for randomized surveillance. Without these
regulatory requirements, ONC-  
ACBs would still be required to perform reactive surveillance, and would
be permitted to  
conduct randomized surveillance of their own accord, using the
methodology identified by ONC  
with respect to scope (§ 170.556(c)(1)), selection method
(§ 170.556(c)(3)), and the number and  
types of locations for in-the-field surveillance (§ 170.556(c)(4)).  
  
Stakeholders have expressed concern that the benefits of in-the-field,
randomized  
surveillance may not outweigh the time commitment required by providers,
particularly if no  
non-conformities are found. In general, providers have expressed that
reactive surveillance (e.g.,  
surveillance based on user complaints) is a more logical and economical
approach
to

surveillance. The removal of randomized surveillance requirements would
also give ONC-ACBs  
the flexibility and time to focus on other priorities, such as the
certification of health IT to the  
2015 Edition. Therefore, as discussed above, we propose to eliminate
certain regulatory  
randomized surveillance requirements.  
  
2\. Removal of the 2014 Edition from the Code of Federal Regulations  
We propose to remove the 2014 Edition from the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR).  
The 2014 Edition was the result of rulemaking completed in 2012 and
includes standards and  
functionality that are now significantly outmoded. Removal of the 2014
Edition would make the  
2015 Edition the baseline for health IT certification. The 2015 Edition,
including the additional  
certification criteria, standards, and requirements proposed in this
proposed rule, better enables  
interoperability and the access, exchange, and use of electronic health
information. Adoption and  
implementation of the 2015 Edition, including the proposals in this
proposed rule, would also  
lead to the benefits outlined in the 2015 Edition final rule (80 FR
62602-62603, 62605-62606,  
62740\) and in this proposed rule (*see, for example,* the Executive
Summary and the  
“Assurances,” “API”, and “Real World Testing” Conditions and Maintenance
of Certification  
sections). Equally important, adoption and implementation of the 2015
Edition by providers  
would lead to the estimated costs savings in this proposed rule through
improved interoperability  
supporting the access, exchange, and use of electronic health
information.  
Removal of the 2014 Edition would eliminate inconsistencies and costs
caused by health  
IT certification and implementation of two different editions with
different functionalities and  
versions of standards. Patient care could improve through the reduced
risk of error that comes  
with the health care system’s consistent implementation and use of
health IT certified to the 2015

Edition. Innovation could also improve with health IT developers
(including third-party software  
developers) developing to only one set of newer standards and
implementation specifications,  
which would be more predictable and less costly.  
Removal of the 2014 Edition would also reduce regulatory burden by no
longer requiring  
the maintenance and support of the 2014 Edition. Maintaining compliance
with only the 2015  
Edition would reduce the cost and burden for health IT developers,
ONC-ACBs, and ONC-ATLs  
because they would no longer have to support two increasingly distinct
sets of requirements as is  
the case now with certification to both the 2014 and 2015 Editions. More
specifically, health IT  
developers would not have to support two maintenance infrastructures and
updating for their  
customers; nor would ONC-ATLs and ONC-ACBs have to support testing,
certification, and  
surveillance for two separate editions of certified health IT.  
As referenced by the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Centers
for Medicare &  
Medicaid Services (CMS) in their rulemakings regarding donations of EHR
items and services,  
we committed to retiring certification criteria editions that are no
longer applicable.[9](ONCs.html#42)We first did  
this with the removal of the 2011 Edition (79 FR 54447). Accordingly,
our proposal to remove  
the outdated 2014 Edition for the reasons discussed above would also
streamline Program  
compliance requirements and ensure there is no regulatory confusion
between ONC's rules and  
other HHS rules.  
To implement the removal of the 2014 Edition from the CFR, we propose to
remove the

criteria[(§ 170.314)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/170.314)

from the CFR. In regard to terms, we propose to retire the 2014
Edition-related definitions found  
in § 170.102, including the “2014 Edition Base EHR,” “2014 Edition EHR
certification criteria,”  
and “Complete EHR, 2014 Edition.” As explained in the 2015 Edition final
rule (80 FR 62719),  
the ability to maintain Complete EHR certification is only permitted
with health IT certified to  
the 2014 Edition certification criteria. Because this concept was
discontinued for the 2015  
Edition, we propose to remove § 170.545 and any references to Complete
EHR from the  
regulation text in conjunction with the removal of the 2014 Edition. We
also propose to remove  
references to the 2014 Edition from the Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS)
definition. However,  
as discussed later in section IV.B.1 (“United States Core Data for
Interoperability”) of this  
proposed rule, we propose to remove the CCDS definition from the CFR and
effectively replace  
it with a new government-unique standard, the United States Core Data
for Interoperability  
(USCDI), proposing to adopt Version 1 (v1) in § 170.213. The new
standard would be applicable  
to certain 2015 Edition certification criteria that currently reference
the CCDS, subject to any of  
these criteria being removed through this rulemaking).  
We propose to remove the standards and implementation specifications
found in §§  
170.200, 170.202, 170.204, 170.205, 170.207, 170.210, and 170.299 that
are only referenced in  
the 2014 Edition certification criteria. Adopted standards that are also
referenced in the 2015  
Edition would remain. We propose to remove requirements in § 170.550(f)
** and any other  
requirements in subpart E, §§ 170.500 through 170.599, which are
specific to the 2014 Edition  
and do not apply to the 2015 Edition.

year of the Quality Payment Program (QPP). The CMS’s final rule, titled
“Medicare Program;  
CY 2018 Updates to the Quality Payment Program: Extreme and
Uncontrollable Circumstance  
Policy for the Transition Year” (82 FR 53568), permits eligible
clinicians to use health IT  
certified to either the 2014 or 2015 Edition certification criteria, or
a combination of the two for  
the CY 2018 performance period. The QPP final rule also states that the
2015 Edition will be the  
sole edition permitted to meet the CEHRT definition starting with the CY
2019 program year.  
Therefore, we propose that the effective date of removal of the 2014
Edition certification criteria  
and related standards, terms, and requirements from the CFR would be the
effective date of a  
subsequent final rule for this proposed rule, which we expect will be
issued in the latter half of  
2019\. We note that we will continue to support Medicare and Medicaid
program attestations by  
maintaining an archive on the CHPL allowing the public to access
historic information on a  
product certified to the 2014 Edition.  
  
3\. Removal of the ONC-Approved Accreditor from the Program  
We propose to remove the ONC-Approved Accreditor (ONC-AA) from the
Program. The  
ONC-AA’s role is to accredit certification bodies for the Program and to
oversee the ONC-  
ACBs. However, years of experience and changes with the Program have led
ONC to conclude  
that, in many respects, the role of the ONC-AA to oversee ONC-ACBs is
now duplicative of  
ONC’s oversight. More specifically, ONC’s experience with administering
the Principles of  
Proper Conduct for ONC-ACBs as well as issuing necessary regulatory
changes (e.g., ONC-  
ACB surveillance and reporting requirements in the 2015 Edition final
rule) has demonstrated  
that ONC on its own has the capacity to provide the appropriate
oversight of ONC-ACBs.

<span id="45"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **45** of **724**  
  
Therefore, we believe removal of the ONC-AA would reduce the Program’s
administrative  
complexity and burden.  
To implement this proposed deregulatory action, we propose to remove the
definition for  
“ONC-Approved Accreditor or ONC-AA” found in § 170.502. We also propose
to remove  
processes related to ONC-AAs found in §§ 170.501(c), 170.503, and
170.504 regarding requests  
for ONC-AA status, ONC-AA ongoing responsibilities, and reconsideration
for requests for  
ONC-AA status. Regarding correspondence and communication with ONC, we
propose to  
remove specific references to the “ONC-AA” and “accreditation
organizations requesting ONC-  
AA status” by revising § 170.505. We also propose to remove the final
rule titled “Permanent  
Certification Program for Health Information Technology; Revisions to
ONC-Approved  
Accreditor Processes[” (76
FR 72636)](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/76-FR-72636) which
established a process for addressing instances  
where the ONC-AA engages in improper conduct or does not perform its
responsibilities under  
the Program. Because this prior final rule relates solely to the role
and removal of the ONC-AA,  
we propose its removal and § 170.575, which codified the final rule in
the CFR.  
These proposed deregulatory actions would also provide an additional
benefit for ONC-  
ACBs. ONC-ACBs would be able to obtain and maintain accreditation to
ISO/IEC 17065, with  
an appropriate scope, from any accreditation body that is a signatory to
the Multilateral  
Recognition Arrangement (MLA) with the International Accreditation Forum
(IAF).  
Accordingly, we propose to revise the application process for ONC-ACB
status in §  
170.520(a)(3) to require documentation that confirms that the applicant
has been accredited to  
ISO/IEC 17065, with an appropriate scope, by any accreditation body that
is a signatory to the  
Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) with the International
Accreditation Forum (IAF),

in place of the ONC-AA accreditation documentation requirements.
Similarly, instead of  
requiring the ONC-AA to evaluate the conformance of ONC-ACBs to ISO/IEC
17065, we  
propose to revise § 170.523(a) to simply require ONC-ACBs to maintain
accreditation in good  
standing to ISO/IEC 17065 for the Program. This means that ONC-ACBs
would need to  
continue to comply with ISO/IEC 17065 and requirements specific to the
ONC Health IT  
Certification Program scheme.  
  
4\. Removal of Certain 2015 Edition Certification Criteria and
Standards  
We have reviewed and analyzed the 2015 Edition to determine whether
there are  
certification criteria we could remove. We have identified both criteria
and standards for removal  
as proposed below. We believe the removal of these criteria and
standards will reduce burden  
and costs for health IT developers and health care providers by
eliminating the need to: design  
and meet specific certification functionalities; prepare, test, and
certify health IT in certain  
instances; adhere to associated reporting and disclosure requirements;
maintain and update  
certifications for certified functionalities; and participate in
surveillance of certified health IT. To  
these points, if our proposals are finalized in a subsequent final rule,
we would expect any  
already issued 2015 Edition certificates to be updated to reflect the
removal of applicable 2015  
Edition certification criteria. We welcome comment on the proposed
removal of the identified  
criteria and standards below and any other 2015 Edition criteria and
standards we should  
consider for removal.

<span id="47"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **47** of **724**  
  
We propose the removal of certain certification criteria from the 2015
Edition that are  
included in the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition. The removal of these
criteria would support  
burden and cost reductions for health IT developers and health care
providers as noted above.  
  
  
i. Problem List  
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “problem list” certification
criterion (§  
170.315(a)(6)). The functionality in this criterion was first adopted as
a 2011 Edition  
certification criterion to support the associated meaningful use Stage 1
objective and measure for  
recording problem list information. In this regard, SNOMED CT® was
adopted specifically to  
support the measure. This 2015 Edition “problem list” criterion remains
relatively functionally  
the same as the 2011 Edition and has exactly the same functionally as
the 2014 Edition “problem  
list” criterion.  
We propose to remove this criterion for multiple reasons. First, this
criterion no longer  
supports the “recording” objective and measure of the CMS Promoting
Interoperability Programs  
as such objective and measure no longer exist. Second, the functionality
is sufficiently  
widespread among health care providers since it has been part of
certification and the Certified  
EHR Technology definition since the 2011 Edition and has not
substantively changed with the  
2015 Edition. Third, we do not believe this functionality would be
removed from health IT  
systems because of our proposal to remove it from the 2015 Edition Base
EHR definition. This  
functionality is essential to clinical care and would be in EHR systems
absent certification,  
particularly considering the limited certification requirements. Fourth,
this functionality does not  
directly support interoperability as the capabilities are focused on
internally recording EHI. In  
this regard, representing problems with SNOMED CT® is part of the USCDI
and, thus, better

supports interoperability through its availability for access and
exchange. Accordingly, we  
propose to remove the “problem list” criterion from the 2015 Edition,
including the 2015 Edition  
Base EHR definition. We note that once removed from the 2015 Edition,
the criterion would also  
no longer be included in the 2015 Edition “safety-enhanced design”
criterion.  
ii. Medication List  
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “medication list” certification
criterion (§  
170.315(a)(7)). The functionality in this criterion was first adopted as
a 2011 Edition  
certification criterion to support the associated meaningful use Stage 1
objective and measure for  
recording medication list information. The criterion does not require
use of a vocabulary  
standard to record medications. This 2015 Edition “medication list”
criterion remains  
functionally the same as the 2011 Edition and 2014 Edition “medication
list” criteria.  
We propose to remove this criterion for multiple reasons. First, this
criterion no longer  
supports a “recording” objective and measure of the CMS Promoting
Interoperability Programs  
as such objective and measure no longer exist. Second, the functionality
is sufficiently  
widespread among health care providers since it has been part of
certification and the Certified

because of our proposal to remove it from the 2015 Edition Base EHR

absent certification,  
particularly considering the limited certification requirements. Fourth,
this functionality does not  
directly support interoperability as the capabilities are focused on

this regard, this criterion does not even require representation of
medications in standardized

nomenclature. Fifth, medications are included in the USCDI and must be
represented in RxNorm  
as part of the USCDI. This approach better supports interoperability
through medication  
information being availability for access and exchange in a structured
format. Accordingly, we  
propose to remove the “medications list” criterion from the 2015
Edition, including the 2015  
Edition Base EHR definition. We note that once removed from the 2015
Edition, the criterion  
would also no longer be included in the 2015 Edition “safety-enhanced
design” criterion.  
  
  
iii. Medication Allergy List  
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “medication allergy list”
certification criterion (§  
170.315(a)(8)). The functionality in this criterion was first adopted as
a 2011 Edition  
certification criterion to support the associated meaningful use Stage 1
objective and measure for  
recording this information. The criterion does not require use of a
vocabulary standard to record  
medication allergies. This 2015 Edition “medication allergy list”
criterion remains functionally  
the same as the 2011 Edition and 2014 Edition “medication allergy list”
criteria.  
We propose to remove this criterion for multiple reasons. First, this
criterion no longer  
supports a “recording” objective and measure of the CMS Promoting
Interoperability Programs  
as such objective and measure no longer exist. Second, the functionality
is sufficiently  
widespread among health care providers since it has been part of
certification and the Certified  
EHR Technology definition since the 2011 Edition and has not
substantively changed with the  
2015 Edition. Third, we do not believe this functionality would be
removed from EHR systems  
because of our proposal to remove it from the 2015 Edition Base EHR
definition. This  
functionality is essential to clinical care and would be in EHR systems
absent certification,  
particularly considering the limited certification requirements. Fourth,
this functionality does not

directly support interoperability as the capabilities are focused on
internally recording EHI. In  
this regard, this criterion does not even require representation of
medication allergies in  
standardized nomenclature. Fifth, medication allergies are included in
the USCDI and must be  
represented in RxNorm as part of the USCDI. This approach better
supports interoperability  
through medication allergy information being availability for access and
exchange in a structured  
format. Accordingly, we propose to remove the “medication allergy list”
criterion from the 2015  
Edition, including the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition. We note that
once removed from the  
2015 Edition, the criterion would also no longer be included in the 2015
Edition “safety-  
enhanced design” criterion.  
  
  
iv. Smoking Status  
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “smoking status” criterion (§
170.315(a)(11)),  
which would include removing it from the 2015 Edition Base EHR
definition. We previously  
adopted a 2015 Edition “smoking status” certification criterion that
does not reference a  
standard. However, the CCDS definition requires smoking status to be
coded in accordance with  
SNOMED CT®. While we continue to believe that the capture of a patient’s
smoking status has  
significant value in assisting providers with addressing the number one
cause of preventable  
death and disease in the United States, we no longer believe that a
criterion that simply ensures  
this functionality exists in health IT presented for certification is
the right focus. As with other  
2014 Edition functionality, we believe this functionality is fairly
ubiquitous now with the  
widespread adoption of health IT certified to the 2014 Edition. Further,
we continue to believe  
that, for the purposes of certification, having smoking status available
for access and exchange  
via the USCDI is ultimately the key requirement for supporting
interoperability.

*Removal of Specific USCDI Smoking Status Code Sets*  
  
As mentioned above, we believe having smoking status available for USCDI
purposes is  
fundamentally important for supporting interoperability. We propose,
however, to remove the  
requirement to code smoking status according to the adopted eight
smoking status SNOMED  
CT® codes as referenced in the value set in § 170.207(h). These eight
codes reflect an attempt to  
capture smoking status in a consistent manner. Stakeholder feedback has,
however, indicated that  
these eight codes do not appropriately and accurately capture all
applicable patients’ smoking  
statuses. Accordingly, we propose to no longer require use of only the
specific eight SNOMED  
CT® codes for representing smoking status (and remove the standard from
§ 170.207). Rather, to  
continue to promote interoperability while also granting providers with
flexibility to better  
support clinical care, we propose that health IT would simply be
required to be capable of  
representing smoking status in SNOMED CT® when such information is
exchanged as part of  
the USCDI.  
b. Drug-Formulary and Preferred Drug Lists  
  
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “drug formulary and preferred drug
list checks”  
criterion in § 170.315(a)(10). We adopted a 2015 Edition “drug-formulary
and preferred drug list  
checks” criterion that separates drug formulary and preferred drug list
functionality, but does *not*  
require any standards or functionality beyond that included in the 2014
Edition “drug-formulary  
checks” criterion. First, we believe this functionality is fairly
ubiquitous now with the  
widespread adoption of health IT certified to the 2014 Edition, which
included this general  
functionality. Second, without standards, this criterion does not
support or facilitate the critical

goal of health IT interoperability. Therefore, removal of this criterion
could reduce health IT  
developer and health care provider burden.  
c. Patient-Specific Education Resources  
  
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “patient-specific education
resources”  
certification criterion (§ 170.315(a)(13)). ONC continues to support
patient and provider  
interaction, and the identification and dissemination of
patient-specific educational materials to  
promote positive health outcomes. However, we no longer believe that
certification focused on a  
health IT’s ability to identifying the existence of patient-specific
education materials encourages  
the advancement of this functionality or interoperability. First, this
criterion would no longer be  
associated with an objective or measure under the Promoting
Interoperability Programs based on  
proposals and determinations in recent CMS rulemakings (83 FR 35928; 83
FR 41664). Second,  
based on the number of health IT products that have been certified for
this functionality as part  
of 2014 Edition certification and already for 2015 Edition
certification, we believe that health  
IT’s ability to identify appropriate patient education materials is
widespread now among health  
IT developers and their customers (e.g., health care providers). Third,
we have recently seen  
innovative advancements in this field, including the use of automation
and algorithms to provide  
appropriate educations materials to patients in a timely manner. These
advancements help limit  
clinical workflow interruptions and demonstrate the use and promise of
health IT to create  
efficiencies and improve patient care. As such, removal of this
criterion would prevent  
certification from creating an unnecessary burden for developers and
providers and an  
impediment to innovation.

has not yet been placed on public display or published in the Federal

<span id="53"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **53** of **724**  
  
We assessed the number of products certified to the 2015 Edition “Common
Clinical  
Data Set summary record – create” (§ 170.315(b)(4)) and “Common Clinical
Data Set summary  
record – receive” (§ 170.315(b)(5)) criteria that have not also been
certified to the 2015 Edition  
“transitions of care” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1). We did this because
the 2015 Edition “CCDS  
summary record” criteria include the same functionality as the 2015
Edition “transitions of care”  
criterion, except for Direct-related transport functionality. Based on
our findings of only two  
unique products certified to these criteria at the time of the drafting
of this proposed rule, there  
appears to be little market demand for certification to them. This
outcome is likely attributable to  
the fact mentioned above regarding their relationship to the 2015
Edition “transition of care”  
criterion, that they are not included in the 2015 Edition Base EHR
definition, and that no HHS  
program specifically requires the use of health IT certified to the
criteria. Therefore, we propose  
to remove these certification criteria from the 2015 Edition.  
  
e. Secure Messaging  
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “secure messaging” criterion (§
170.315(e)(2)).  
ONC strongly supports patient and provider communication, as well as
protecting the privacy  
and security of patient information. However, we no longer believe that
separate certification  
focused on a health IT’s ability to send and receive secure messages
between health care  
providers and patients is necessary. First, this criterion would no
longer be associated with an  
objective or measure under the Promoting Interoperability Programs based
on proposals and  
determinations in recent CMS rulemakings (83 FR 41664; 83 FR 35929).
Second, there are  
multiple other 2015 Edition certification criteria that support patient
engagement, such as the  
2015 Edition “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party,” “API,” and
“patient health information

capture” certification criteria. Third, we have seen developers
integrate this functionality as part  
of other patient engagement features, such as patient portals. With
these considerations in mind  
and the lack of a negative impact on health IT interoperability, we
believe that the removal of  
this criterion will help reduce burden and costs, while also spurring
further innovations in patient  
engagement.  
5\. Removal of Certain ONC Health IT Certification Program
Requirements  
We propose to remove certain mandatory disclosure requirements and a
related  
attestation requirement under the Program. We believe removal of these
requirements will  
reduce costs and burden for Program stakeholders, particularly health IT
developers and ONC-  
ACBs. We welcome comment on the proposed removal of these requirements
and any other  
certification or Program requirements we should consider for removal.  
  
a. Limitations Disclosures  
We propose to remove § 170.523(k)(1)(iii)(B), which requires ONC-ACBs to
ensure that  
certified health IT includes a detailed description of all known
material information concerning  
limitations that a user may encounter in the course of implementing and
using the certified health  
IT, whether to meet “meaningful use” objectives and measures or to
achieve any other use within  
the scope of the health IT's certification. We also propose to remove §
170.523(k)(1)(iv)(B) and  
(C), which state that the types of information required to be disclosed
include, but are not limited  
to: (B) limitations, whether by contract or otherwise, on the use of any
capability to which  
technology is certified for any purpose within the scope of the
technology's certification; or in  
connection with any data generated in the course of using any capability
to which health IT is  
certified; (C) Limitations, including but not limited to technical or
practical limitations of

technology or its capabilities, that could prevent or impair the
successful implementation,  
configuration, customization, maintenance, support, or use of any
capabilities to which  
technology is certified; or that could prevent or limit the use,
exchange, or portability of any data  
generated in the course of using any capability to which technology is
certified.  
These disclosure requirements regarding certified health IT limitations
are superseded by  
the Cures Act information blocking provision and Conditions of
Certification, which we are  
implementing with this proposed rule. In particular, section
3001(c)(5)(D)(ii) of the **** Cures Act  
requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition of Certification
under the Program, provide  
assurances to the Secretary that, unless for legitimate purposes
specified by the Secretary, the  
developer will not take any action that constitutes information blocking
as defined in section  
3022(a) of the PHSA, or any other action that may inhibit the
appropriate exchange, access, and  
use of electronic health information. These assurances specifically
focus on preventing  
information blocking and promoting appropriate exchange, access, and use
of electronic health  
information. We further propose adding as a complementary Condition of
Certification that  
developers would be prohibited from taking any action that could
interfere with a user’s ability  
to access or use certified capabilities for any purpose within the scope
of the technology’s  
certification. Such actions may inhibit the appropriate access,
exchange, or use of electronic  
health information and are therefore contrary to this proposed Condition
of Certification and the  
statutory provision that it implements. Based on these Conditions of
Certification, we believe  
that disclosures of limitations by health IT developers would be
unlikely and unnecessary given  
their prohibition.

<span id="56"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **56** of **724**  
  
We propose to remove the Principle of Proper Conduct (PoPC) in §
170.523(k)(2),  
which requires a health IT developer to submit an attestation that it
will disclose all of the  
information in its mandatory disclosures per § 170.523(k)(1) to
specified parties (e.g., potential  
customers or anyone inquiring about a product quote or description of
services). We propose that  
this provision is no longer necessary and that its removal is
appropriate to further reduce  
administrative burden for health IT developers and ONC-ACBs. First, our
experience with  
developer attestations to this requirement is that over 90% of
developers with certified health IT  
have attested that they will provide “transparency information.” Second,
the information that  
developers would be asked to attest to, whether our proposal above to
remove certain disclosure  
requirements is finalized or not, is now readily available on health IT
developers’ websites as the  
mandatory disclosure requirements were implemented almost three years
ago. Therefore, we  
believe removal of this requirement is appropriate.  
6\. Recognition of Food and Drug Administration Processes  
Section 618 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation
Act (FDASIA),  
Public Law 112-144, required that the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), in consultation  
with ONC and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) (collectively
referred to as “the  
Agencies”[10](ONCs.html#56) for this proposal), develop a report that
contains a proposed strategy and  
recommendations on an appropriate, risk-based regulatory framework
pertaining to health IT,  
including mobile medical applications, that promotes innovation,
protects patient safety, and  
avoids regulatory duplication. The FDASIA Health IT Report of April
2014[11](ONCs.html#56) contains a  
  
10 ONC is not an agency, but an Office, within the Department of Health
and Human
Services.

proposed strategy and recommendations on an appropriate, risk-based
regulatory framework  
pertaining to health IT that promotes innovation, protects patient
safety, and avoids regulatory  
duplication. Public comments, received prior to the report and
after,[12](ONCs.html#57) recommended that health  
IT developers/manufacturers apply a single process that satisfies the
requirements of all agencies  
and that existing safety and quality-related processes, systems, and
standards should be leveraged  
for patient safety in health IT. On July 27, 2017, FDA announced a
voluntary Software  
Precertification (Pre-Cert) Pilot Program as part of a broader Digital
Health Innovation Action  
Plan.[13](ONCs.html#57)It was developed in order to create a tailored
approach toward recognizing the unique  
characteristics of digital technology by looking first at the firm,
rather than primarily at each  
product of the firm, as is currently done for traditional medical
products. The FDA plans to  
explore whether and how pre-certified companies that have demonstrated a
culture of quality,  
patient safety, and organizational excellence could bring certain types
of digital health products  
to market either without FDA premarket review or with a more streamlined
FDA premarket  
review.  
a. FDA Software Pre-Certification Pilot Program  
ONC believes that health IT developers that hold precertification under
the FDA Digital  
Health Software Precertification Program (FDA Software Precertification
Program) when they  
present health IT for certification under the Program could qualify for,
and benefit from, further  
efficiencies under the Program. Title IV of the Cures Act provides ONC

Program to oversee health IT developers through Conditions and
Maintenance of Certification  
requirements (*see* section VII Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification of this proposed  
rule). With this new authority and our authority over health IT
developers’ health IT certified  
under the Program, we propose to establish processes that would provide
health IT developers  
that can document holding precertification under the FDA Software
Precertification Program  
with exemptions to the ONC Health IT Certification Program’s
requirements for testing and  
certification of its health IT to the 2015 Edition “quality management
systems” criterion (§  
170.315(g)(4)) and the 2015 Edition “safety-enhanced design” criterion
(§ 170.315(g)(3)), as  
these criteria are applicable to the health IT developer’s health IT
presented for certification. We  
also believe that such a “recognition” could, depending on the final
framework of the FDA  
Software Precertification Program (e.g., the key performance indicators
used to demonstrate  
performance and outcomes of excellence), be applicable to the
functionally-based 2015 Edition  
“clinical” certification criteria (§ 170.315(a)). More specifically,
this could address the  
“computerized provider order entry (CPOE)” (§ 170.315(a)(1), (2), and
(3)), “drug-drug, drug-  
allergy interaction checks for CPOE” (§ 170.315(a)(4)), “clinical
decision support” (§  
170.315(a)(9)), and “implantable device list” (§ 170.315(a)(14))
certification criteria. Such  
“recognition” could also be appropriate to address any or all of the
following functionally-based  
2015 Edition criteria in the event their proposed removal is not
finalized: “problem list” (§  
170.315(a)(6)), “medication list” (§ 170.315(a)(7)), “medication allergy
list” (§ 170.315(a)(8)),  
“drug-formulary and preferred drug list checks” (§ 170.315(a)(10)),” and
“smoking status” (§  
170.315(a)(11)).

Our proposed “recognition” would align with both Executive Orders 13563
and 13771  
regarding deregulatory, less burdensome, and more effective initiatives.
It would also serve as a  
regulatory relief for those health IT developers qualifying as small
businesses under the  
Regulatory Flexibility Act (*see* section XIV.C.3 Regulatory Flexibility
Act of this proposed  
rule). Furthermore, it would closely align with FDASIA’s instruction to
promote innovation,  
protect patient safety, and avoid regulatory duplication. However,
despite these proffered  
benefits, there may be reasons not to adopt such a “recognition”
approach. For example,  
stakeholders may not agree that the FDA Software Precertification
Program (and/or subsequent  
finalized program) sufficiently aligns with our Program. Developers and
providers may have  
varying and divergent views about the benefits and detriments of such an
approach. Further,  
while we believe that we could properly operationalize such an approach
by ensuring  
certifications indicate which criteria have been “deemed certified” by
ONC (but still subject to  
ONC-ACB surveillance), stakeholders may have other operational concerns.
Accordingly, we  
welcome comments on these and other aspects of our proposed
“recognition” approach,  
including the 2015 Edition certification criteria that should be
eligible for “recognition.”  
b. Development of Similar Independent Program Processes – Request for  
Information  
Recognition of the FDA Software Pre-Certification Program for purposes
of our  
Program, as noted above, may eventually be determined to be infeasible
or insufficient to meet  
our goals of reducing burden and promoting innovation. With this in
mind, we request comment  
on whether ONC should establish new regulatory processes tailored
towards recognizing the  
unique characteristics of health IT (e.g., EHR software) by looking
first at the health IT

developer, rather than primarily at the health IT presented for
certification, as is currently done  
under the Program. For example, ONC could possibly establish Conditions
and Maintenance of  
Certification requirements, through rulemaking, that facilitate the
deeming of all of a health IT  
developer’s health IT as “certified” under the Program for certification
criteria identified by  
ONC as solely “functionally-based” criteria (i.e., not essential to
interoperability, such as the  
“CPOE” criteria) or possibly broader in scope. This approach could rely
on, but not be limited to,  
one or a combination of the following: (1) certain demonstrated health
IT developer processes or  
health IT functionality; (2) prior successful certification of a health
IT developer’s health IT  
under the Program; (3) results of real world testing for
interoperability as required by the Cures  
Act and the proposed implementing regulatory Condition of Certification
(*see* section VII.B.5 of  
this proposed rule); and/or (4) the results of the EHR Reporting Program
once implemented (*see*  
section VII.B.7 of this proposed rule). No matter the specifics, we are
most interested in whether  
stakeholders believe this is an approach we should pursue in conjunction
with, or in lieu of, the  
proposed approach of recognizing the FDA Software Pre-Certification
Pilot Program. We also

such an approach and

*A. Standards and Implementation Specifications*  
1\. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act **  
The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) of 1995 (15
U.S.C.  
3701 et. seq.) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular
A–119[14](ONCs.html#61)require the  
use of, wherever practical, technical standards that are developed or
adopted by voluntary  
consensus standards bodies to carry out policy objectives or activities,
with certain exceptions.  
The NTTAA and OMB Circular A-119 provide exceptions to electing only
standards developed  
or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies, namely when doing so
would be  
inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Agencies have
the discretion to  
decline the use of existing voluntary consensus standards if determined
that such standards are  
inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical, and instead
use a government-unique  
standard or other standard. In addition to the consideration of
voluntary consensus standards, the  
OMB Circular A-119 recognizes the contributions of standardization
activities that take place  
outside of the voluntary consensus standards process. Therefore, in
instances where use of  
voluntary consensus standards would be inconsistent with applicable law
or otherwise  
impracticable, other standards should be considered that meet the
agency’s regulatory,  
procurement or program needs, deliver favorable technical and economic
outcomes, and

widely utilized in the marketplace. In this proposed rule, we use
voluntary consensus standards  
except for:  
• The standard we propose to adopt in § 170.213. We propose to remove
the Common Clinical  
Data Set (CCDS) definition and effectively replace it with a government
unique standard, the  
United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI), Version 1(v1);  
• The standard we propose to adopt in § 170.215(a)(2). We propose the
government unique  
API Resource Collection in Health (ARCH) Version 1 implementation
specification;  
• The standards we propose to adopt in § 170.215(a)(3) through (5) for
application  
programming interfaces (APIs). These market driven consortia standards
have been  
developed through a streamlined process that does not meet the full
definition of voluntary  
consensus standards development but still includes representation from
those interested in the  
use cases supported by the standards (e.g., health IT developers and
health care providers). In  
the absence of available voluntary consensus standards that would meet
our needs, these  
standards deliver favorable technical and economic outcomes,
particularly improved  
interoperability. Further, some of these standards may eventually
proceed through a  
standards development organization for approval; and  
• The standards we propose to adopt in § 170.205(h)(3) and (k)(3). We
propose to replace the  
current HL7 QRDA standards with government unique standards that more
effectively  
support the associated certification criterion’s use case, which is
reporting eCQM data to  
CMS.

In accordance with Office of the Federal Register regulations related to
“incorporation by  
reference,” 1 CFR part 51, which we follow when we adopt proposed
standards and/or  
implementation specifications in any subsequent final rule, the entire
standard or implementation  
specification document is deemed published in the **Federal Register**
when incorporated by  
reference therein with the approval of the Director of the Federal
Register. Once published,  
compliance with the standard and implementation specification includes
the entire document  
unless we specify otherwise. For example, if we adopted the Health Level
7 (HL7) Argonaut  
Data Query Implementation Guide (IG) proposed in this proposed rule
(*see* section VII.B.4.b),  
health IT certified to certification criteria referencing this IG would
need to demonstrate  
compliance with all mandatory elements and requirements of the IG. If an
element of the IG is  
optional or permissive in any way, it would remain that way for testing
and certification *unless*  
we specified otherwise in regulation. In such cases, the regulatory text
would preempt the  
permissiveness of the IG.

in the **Code of Federal Regulations** (79 FR 66267; 1 CFR 51.5(a)). To
comply with these  
requirements, in section X (“Incorporation by Reference”) of this
preamble, we provide  
summaries of, and uniform resource locators (URLs) to, the standards and

*B. Revised and New 2015 Edition Criteria*  
**  
In order to capture and share patient data efficiently, health care
providers need health  
IT that store data in structured formats. Structured data allows health
care providers to easily  
retrieve and transfer patient information, and use health IT in ways
that can aid patient care. We  
propose to adopt revised and new 2015 Edition certification criteria,
including new standards, to  
support these objectives. Some of these criteria and standards are
included in the Certified EHR  
Technology (CEHRT) definition used for participation in HHS Programs,
such as the Promoting  
Interoperability Programs (formerly the EHR Incentive Programs), some
are required to be met  
for participation in the ONC Health IT Certification Program, and some,
though beneficial, are  
unassociated with the CEHRT definition and **not** **required** for
participating in any HHS  
program, including the ONC Health IT Certification Program.  
1\. The United States Core Data for Interoperability Standard (USCDI)  
The initial focus of the Program was to support the Medicare and
Medicaid EHR  
Incentive Programs (76 FR 1294) now referred to as the Promoting
Interoperability Programs  
(and referenced as such hereafter). As such, the 2014 Edition
certification criteria mirrored those  
functions specified by Promoting Interoperability Programs’ objectives
and measures. In order to  
improve efficiency and streamline the common data within our Program’s
certification criteria,  
we created a single definition for all the required data which could be
referenced for all  
applicable certification criteria. We created the term “Common MU Data
Set” to encompass the  
common set of MU data types/elements (and associated vocabulary
standards) for which  
certification would be required across several certification criteria
(77 FR 54170).

The 2015 Edition final rule modified the Program to make it open and
accessible to more  
types of health IT, and health IT that supports various care and
practice settings beyond those  
included in the Promoting Interoperability Programs (80 FR 62604). In
comparison to the  
previous editions, the 2015 Edition focused on identifying health IT
components necessary to  
establish an interoperable nationwide health information infrastructure,
fostering innovation and  
open new market opportunities, and allowing for more health care
provider and patient choices  
in electronic health information access and exchange. In order to align
with this approach, we  
revised the concept of the “Common MU Data Set” definition and changed
the name to the  
“Common Clinical Data Set” (CCDS) definition. The CCDS definition was
further revised in the  
2015 Edition rulemaking to account for new and updated vocabulary and
content standards in  
order to improve and advance interoperability and health information
exchange (80 FR 62604). It  
further expanded accessibility and availability of data exchanged by
updating the definition of  
Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) (2015 Edition Base EHR definition)
to include enhanced  
data export, transitions of care, and application programming interface
(API) capabilities, all of  
which required that at a minimum the CCDS be available (80 FR
62602-62604).  
  
The regulatory approach to use and reference a “definition” to identify
electronic health  
information, including with associated vocabulary codes, for access,
exchange and use has had  
its drawbacks. While the CCDS definition served its designed purpose, to
cut down on repetitive  
text in each of the certification criteria in which it is referenced, it
also began to be colloquially  
used for many different purposes. As the CCDS definition’s relevance
grew outside of its  
regulatory context it became a symbolic and practical limit to the
industry’s collective interests  
to go beyond the CCDS data for access, exchange, and use. As we move
towards value-based

care and the inclusion of data classes that go beyond clinical data, and
as part of ONC’s  
continued efforts to evaluate the availability of a minimum baseline of
data classes that must be  
commonly available for interoperable exchange, we acknowledge the need
to change and  
improve our regulatory approach to the CCDS. Therefore, in order to
advance interoperability by  
ensuring compliance with new data and vocabulary codes sets that support
the data, we propose  
to remove the “Common Clinical Data Set” definition and its references
from the 2015 Edition  
and replace it with the “United States Core Data for Interoperability”
(USCDI) standard. The  
USCDI standard aims to achieve the goals set forth in the Cures Act by
specifying a common set  
of data classes for interoperable exchange.  
We propose to adopt the USCDI as a standard as such term is defined in §
170.102. In §  
170.102, a “standard” is defined as a “technical, functional, or
performance-based rule,  
condition, requirement, or specification that stipulates instructions,
fields, codes, data, materials,  
characteristics, or actions.” The USCDI standard would comprise data
classes, which may be  
further delineated into groupings of specific data element(s). For
example, “patient  
demographics” is a data class and within that data class there is
“patient name,” which is a data  
element. As noted in section IV.B.1.b, for the overall structure and
organization of the USCDI,  
please consult[www.healthIT.gov/USCDI.](http://www.healthit.gov/USCDI)  
ONC intends to establish and follow a predictable, transparent, and
collaborative process  
to expand the USCDI, including providing stakeholders with the
opportunity to comment on the  
USCDI’s expansion. Once the Secretary adopts the first version of the
USCDI through  
rulemaking, which we propose in this rulemaking, health IT developers
would be allowed to take  
advantage of the “Standards Version Advancement Process” flexibility.

Advancement Process , proposed in Section VII.B.5 (below), would permit
health IT developers  
to voluntarily implement and use a new version of an adopted standard
(e.g., the USCDI),  
subject to certain conditions including a requirement that the new
version is approved for use by  
the National Coordinator.  
  
  
a. USCDI 2015 Edition Certification Criteria  
  
We propose to adopt the USCDI Version 1 (USCDI v1) in § 170.213.
[15](ONCs.html#67) The USCDI is a  
standardized set of health data classes and constituent data elements
that would be required to  
support nationwide electronic health information exchange. Once adopted
in a final rule, health  
IT developers would be required to update their certified health IT to
support the USCDI v1 for  
all certification criteria affected by this proposed change. We propose
to revise the following  
CCDS dependent 2015 Edition certification criteria to incorporate the
USCDI standard:  
• “transitions of care” (§ 170.315(b)(1));  
• “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” (§ 170.315(e)(1));  
• “consolidated CDA creation performance” (§ 170.315(g)(6));  
• “transmission to public health agencies – electronic case reporting”
(§ 170.315(f)(5)); and  
• “application access – all data request” (§ 170.315(g)(9)).  
We note that we did not include the “data export” criterion (§
170.315(b)(6)) as we are  
proposing to remove it and adopt instead the “EHI export” criterion (§
170.315(b)(10)). For  
similar reasons, we did not include the “application access – data
category request” criterion (§  
  
15 We note that USCDI v1is an updated version and distinguished from the
*Draft United States Core Data for  
Interoperability (USCDI)* previously made available for public review
and comment in the course of its development  
as a prospective standard.

170.315(g)(8)) because we are proposing to replace it with the API
certification criterion (§  
170.315(g)(10)), which derives its data requirements from the USCDI.  
We propose, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement for the real
world testing  
Condition of Certification, that health IT developers with health IT
certified to the five above-  
identified certification criteria prior to the effective date of a
subsequent final rule would have to  
update such certified health IT to the proposed revisions. We further
propose, as a Maintenance  
of Certification requirement for the real world testing Condition of
Certification, that health IT  
developers must provide the updated certified health IT to all their
customers with health IT  
previously certified to the identified criteria no later than 24 months
after the effective date of a  
final rule for this proposed rule. For the purposes of meeting this
compliance timeline, we expect  
health IT developers to update their certified health IT without new
mandatory testing and notify  
their ONC-ACB on the date at which they have reached compliance.
Developers would also  
need to factor these updates into their next real world testing plan as
discussed in section VII.B.5  
of this proposed rule. Further, we refer health IT developer to the next
section, which describes  
how the USCDI differs from the current CCDS.  
b. USCDI Standard - Data Classes Included  
  
The USCDI Version 1 (USCDI v1) and its constituent data elements account
for the  
public comments we received on the Draft USCDI and Proposed Expansion
Process[16](ONCs.html#68) published  
in January 2018 as well as initial feedback from the Health IT Advisory
Committee. The  
standard as we propose to adopt it in § 170.213 also reflects and
acknowledges the burden that  
rapidly expanding the USCDI v1 beyond the CCDS could cause. As a result,
the USCDI v1 is a

modest expansion of the CCDS, which we believe most health IT developers
already support,  
were already working toward, or should be capable of updating their
health IT to support in a  
timely manner. The following describes only the delta between the CCDS
and the USCDI v1.

[www.healthIT.gov/USCDI.](http://www.healthit.gov/USCDI)  
  
  
  
i. Updated Versions of Vocabulary Standard Code Sets  
We propose that the USCDI Version 1 (USCDI v1) include the newest
versions of the  
“minimum standard” code sets included in the CCDS available at
publication of a subsequent  
final rule. We request comment on this proposal and on whether this
could result in any  
interoperability concerns. To note, criteria such as the 2015 Edition
“family health history”  
criterion (§ 170.315(a)(12)), the 2015 Edition “transmission to
immunization registries” criterion  
(§ 170.315(f)(1)), and the 2015 Edition “transmission to public health
agencies—syndromic  
surveillance” criterion (§ 170.315(f)(2)) reference “minimum standard”
code sets; however, we  
are considering changing the certification baseline versions of the code
set for these criteria from  
the versions adopted in the 2015 Edition final rule to ensure complete
interoperability alignment.  
We welcome comment on whether we should adopt such an approach.  
We also note, for purposes of clarity, that consistent with § 170.555,
unless the Secretary  
prohibits the use of a newer version of an identified minimum standard
code set for certification,  
health IT could continue to be certified or upgraded to a newer version
of an identified minimum  
standard code set than that included in USCDI v1 or the most recent
USCDI version that the  
National Coordinator has approved for use in the Program via the
Standards Version  
Advancement Process.

ii. Address and Phone Number  
  
The USCDI v1 includes new data elements for “address” and “phone
number.” The  
inclusion of “address” (to represent the postal location for the
patient) and “phone number” (to  
represent the patient’s telephone number) would improve the
comprehensiveness of health  
information for patient care. The inclusion of these data elements is
also consistent with the list  
of patient matching data elements already specified in the 2015 Edition
“transitions of care”  
certification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)), which supports the
exchange of patient health  
information between providers of patient care.  
  
  
  
iii. Pediatric Vital Signs  
  
The USCDI v1 includes the pediatric vital sign data elements, which are
specified as  
optional health information in the 2015 Edition CCDS definition.
Pediatric vital signs include:  
head occipital-frontal circumference for children less than 3 years of
age, BMI percentile per age  
and sex for youth 2-20 years of age, weight for age per length and sex
for children less than 3  
years of age, and the reference range/scale or growth curve, as
appropriate. As explained in  
section VI.A.2 of this proposed rule, the inclusion of pediatric vital
sign data elements in the  
draft USCDI v1 would align with the provisions of the Cures Act related
to health IT to support  
the health care of children. Stakeholders emphasized the value of
pediatric vital sign data  
elements to better support the safety and quality of care delivered to
children. We also note that,  
as discussed in the 2015 Edition proposed rule, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention  
(CDC) recommends the use of these pediatric vital signs for settings of
care in which pediatric  
and adolescent patients are seen [(80
FR 16818-](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/80-FR-16818)16819)

of a reference range/scale or growth curve would help with proper
interpretation of the

measurements for the BMI percentile per age and sex and weight for age
per length and sex.  
Further, the inclusion of this health information in the USCDI v1 is the
appropriate next step  
after first specifying them as optional in the CCDS definition as part
of the 2015 Edition  
rulemaking and as a means of supporting patient access to their EHI in a
longitudinal format  
through certified health IT (*see* section 3009(e)(2)(A)(i) of the PHSA
as amended by the Cures  
Act). We recognize, however, that certain health IT developers and their
customers may not find  
these capabilities and information useful. Therefore, we request comment
on the inclusion of  
pediatric vital signs in the USCDI v1, including the potential benefits
and costs for all  
stakeholders stemming from its inclusion in the USCDI v1.  
iv. Clinical Notes  
  
The USCDI v1 includes a new data class, titled “clinical notes.”
“Clinical notes” is  
included in the USCDI v1 based on significant feedback from the industry
since the 2015 Edition  
final rule. We also received feedback during the Trusted Exchange
Framework and Common  
Agreement (TEFCA) stakeholder sessions and public comment period. It has
been identified by  
stakeholders as highly desirable data for interoperable exchange. The
free text portion of the  
clinical notes was most often relayed by clinicians as the data they
sought, but were often  
missing during electronic health information exchange. Clinical notes
can be composed of text  
generated from structured (pick-list and/or check the box) fields as
well as unstructured (free  
text) data. A clinical note may include the assessment, diagnosis, plan
of care and evaluation of  
plan, patient teaching, and other relevant data points.  
We recognize that a number of different clinical notes could be useful
for stakeholders. It  
is our understanding that work is being done in the community to focus
on a subset of clinical

notes. We considered three options for identifying the different “note
types” to adopt in USCDI  
v1. The first option we considered would allow for the community to
offer any and all  
recommended notes. The second option we considered would set a minimum
standard of eight  
note types. This option was derived from the eight note types identified
by the Argonaut Project  
participants.[17](ONCs.html#72)The third option we identified would look
to the eleven HL7 Consolidated  
Clinical Data Architecture (C-CDA) document types identified in the
C-CDA Release 2.1, which  
also included the note types being identified by the Argonaut Project
participants. We ultimately  
decided to move forward with the second option because it unites public
and private interests  
toward the same goal. The eight selected note types are a minimum bar
and, in the future, the  
USCDI may be updated to include other clinical notes. Specifically, we
propose to include the  
following clinical note types for both inpatient and outpatient (primary
care, emergency  
department, etc.) settings in USCDI v1 as a minimum standard: (1)
Discharge Summary note; (2)  
History & Physical; (3) Progress Note; (4) Consultation Note; (5)
Imaging Narrative; (6)  
Laboratory Report Narrative; (7) Pathology Report Narrative; and (8)
Procedures Note. We seek  
comment on whether to include additional note types as part of the USCDI
v1.  
  
  
v. Provenance  
The USCDI v1 also includes a new data class, titled “provenance.”
“Provenance” has  
been identified by stakeholders[18](ONCs.html#72)as valuable for
interoperable exchange. The provenance of data  
was also referenced by stakeholders as a fundamental need to improve the
trustworthiness and

reliability of the data being exchanged. Provenance describes the
metadata, or extra information  
about data, that can help answer questions such as when and who created
the data.  
The inclusion of “provenance” as a data class in the USCDI v1 would also
complement  
the Cures Act requirement to support the exchange of data through the
use of APIs. This  
approach differs from the exchange of data via the C-CDA. While C-CDAs
are often critiqued  
due to their relative “length,” the C-CDA represents the output of a
clinical encounter and  
includes relevant context. The same will not always be true in an API
context. APIs facilitate the  
granular exchange of data and, as noted in the 2015 Edition final rule,
offer the potential to  
aggregate data from multiple sources in a web or mobile application (80
FR 62675). The  
inclusion of provenance would help retain the relevant context so the
recipient can better  
understand the origin of the data. As noted in section VII.B.4, we are
also proposing to include  
provenance in our proposed “API Resource Collection in Health” (ARCH)
Version 1  
implementation specification in § 170.215(a)(2), which would list a set
of base Fast Healthcare  
Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) resources that Health IT Modules
certified to the proposed  
API criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)) would need to support.  
We propose to further delineate the provenance data class into three
data elements: “the  
author,” which represents the person(s) who is responsible for the
information; “the author’s time  
stamp,” which indicates the time the information was recorded; and “the
author’s organization,”  
which would be the organization the author is associated with at the
time they interacted with the  
data. We have identified these three data elements as fundamental for
data recipients to have  
available and both are commonly captured and currently available through
standards. We request  
comment on the inclusion of these three data elements and whether any
other provenance data

elements, such as the identity of the individual or entity the data was
obtained from or sent by  
(sometimes discussed in standards working groups as the provenance of
the data’s “last hop”),  
would be essential to include as part of the USCDI v1 standard. We
acknowledge that there is  
currently work to help define provenance in a standard robust manner,
and we anticipate  
adopting the industry consensus once it becomes available.  
  
  
vi. Unique Device Identifier(s) for a Patient's Implantable Device(s)  
We are aware of a recently published implementation guide (IG) within
HL7 that  
provides further guidance on the unique device identifier (UDI)
requirements. The IG, Health  
Level 7 (HL7®) CDA R2 Implementation Guide: C-CDA Supplemental Templates
for Unique  
Device Identification (UDI) for Implantable Medical Devices, Release
1-US Realm[19,](ONCs.html#74) identifies  
changes needed to the C-CDA to better facilitate the exchange of the
individual UDI components  
in the health care system when devices are implanted in a patient. The
UDI components include  
the Device Identifier (DI) and the following individual production
identifiers: the lot or batch  
number, serial number, manufacturing date, expiration date, and distinct
identification code.  
However, as this new IG has been recently published, we request comment
on whether we  
should add this UDI IG as a requirement for health IT to adopt in order
to meet the requirements  
for UDI USCDI Data Class. In addition, we do not have a reliable basis
on which to estimate  
how much it would cost to meet the requirements outlined in the UDI IG;
and, therefore, we  
request comment on the cost and burden of complying with this proposed
requirement.  
vii. Medication Data Request for Comment

The USCDI v1 “Medication” data class includes two constituent data
elements within it:  
Medications and Medication Allergies. With respect to the latter,
Medication Allergies, we  
request comment on an alternative approach. This alternative would
result in removing the  
Medication Allergies data element from the Medication data class and
creating a new data class  
titled, “Substance Reactions,” which would be meant to be inclusive of
“Medication Allergies.”  
The new “Substance Reactions” data class would include the following
data elements:  
“Substance” and “Reaction,” and include SNOMED CT as an additional
applicable standard for  
non-medication substances.  
c. USCDI Standard – Relationship to Content Exchange Standards and  
Implementation Specifications  
  
In order to align with our approach to be responsive to the evolution of
standards and to  
facilitate updates to newer versions of standards, the USCDI v1 (§
170.213) is “content  
exchange” standard agnostic. It establishes “data policy” and does not
directly associate with the  
content exchange standards and implementation specifications which,
given a particular context,  
may be necessary to exchange the entire USCDI, a USCDI class, or
elements within it. To our  
knowledge, all data classes in the USCDI v1 can be supported by commonly
used “content  
exchange” standards, including HL7 C-CDA Release 2.1 and FHIR®.  
  
  
d. Clinical Notes C-CDA Implementation Specification  
In conjunction with our proposal to adopt the USCDI v1, we propose to
adopt the HL7  
CDA® R2 IG: C-CDA Templates for Clinical Notes R1 Companion Guide,
Release 1 in §  
170.205(a)(4)(i) (“C-CDA Companion Guide”). The C-CDA Companion Guide
provides  
supplemental guidance and additional technical clarification for
specifying data in the C-CDA

Release 2.1.[20](ONCs.html#76) As noted above, the proposed USCDI v1
includes new data classes, such as  
“clinical notes,” which are further supported through the C-CDA
Companion Guide. For  
example, the C-CDA Companion Guide provides specifications for clinical
notes by indicating  
that clinical notes should be recorded in “note activity” and requires
references to other discrete  
data, such as “encounters.” The C-CDA Companion Guide also enhances
implementation of the  
2015 Edition certification criteria that reference the C-CDA Release 2.1
(§ 170.205(a)(4)). As  
noted by stakeholders, the C-CDA Release 2.1 includes some optionality
and ambiguity with  
respect to data element components, such as the locations and value
sets. We attempted to  
address some of this optionality by clarifying requirements using
Certification Companion  
Guides (CCGs)[21](ONCs.html#76)and by specifying in the CCDS definition
where certain data should be placed  
in the C-CDA Release 2.1 templates (e.g., “goals” in the goals
section).[22](ONCs.html#76)The C-CDA  
Companion Guide, which was released after the 2015 Edition final rule,
provides similar, but  
additional C-CDA implementation structure. For example, race and
ethnicity are required data  
elements in the USCDI (formerly the CCDS) and must be included in C-CDA
exchanges if  
known, or they may be marked with a nullFlavor of UNK (unknown) if not
known. The C-CDA  
Release 2.1 is unclear on the location and value set, but the C-CDA
Companion Guide clarifies  
the location and value set. The adoption of the C-CDA Companion Guide
would align with our  
goal to increase the consistent implementation of standards among health
IT developers and  
improve interoperability. We propose to adopt this C-CDA Companion Guide
to support

practice implementation of USCDI v1 data classes and 2015 Edition
certification criteria that  
reference C-CDA Release 2.1 (§ 170.205(a)(4)). The criteria include:  
• “transitions of care” (§ 170.315(b)(1));  
• “clinical information reconciliation and incorporation” (§
170.315(b)(2));  
• “care plan” (§ 170.315(b)(9));  
• “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” (§ 170.315(e)(1));  
• “consolidated CDA creation performance” (§ 170.315(g)(6)); and  
• “application access – all data request” (§ 170.315(g)(9)).  
We propose, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement for the real
world testing  
Condition of Certification, that health IT developers with health IT
certified to the six above-  
identified certification criteria prior to the effective date of a
subsequent final rule would have to  
update such certified health IT to the proposed revisions. We further
propose, as a Maintenance  
of Certification requirement for the real world testing Condition of
Certification, that health IT  
developers must provide the updated certified health IT to all their
customers with health IT  
previously certified to the identified criteria no later than 24 months
after the effective date of a  
final rule for this proposed rule. For the purposes of meeting this
compliance timeline, we expect  
health IT developers to update their certified health IT without new
mandatory testing and notify  
their ONC-ACB on the date at which they have reached compliance.
Developers would also  
need to factor these updates into their next real world testing plan as
discussed in section VII.B.5  
of this proposed rule.

We propose to update the electronic prescribing (e-Rx) SCRIPT standard
used for  
“electronic prescribing” in the 2015 Edition to NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071,
which would result in  
a new e-Rx standard becoming the baseline for certification. We propose
to adopt this standard  
in § 170.205(b)(1). ONC and CMS have historically maintained
complementary policies of  
aligning health IT certification criteria and associated standard for
e-prescribing with the CMS  
Medicare Part D e-Rx and MH standards (75 FR 44589; 77 FR 54198). To
this end, CMS has  
retired the current standard (NCPDP SCRIPT version 10.6) for e-RX and MH
and adopted  
NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 as the standard for Part D e-Rx and MH effective
January 1, 2020,  
conditional on ONC updating the Program to the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071
standard for its e-Rx  
certification criterion (*see also* 42 CFR 423.160(b)(1)(v) and
(2)(iv)). In addition, CMS recently  
sought comment regarding whether the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard could
facilitate  
future reporting of the proposed Query of Prescription Drug Monitoring
Program (PDMP)  
measure in both the 2019 Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule (83 FR
35923) and Hospital  
Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems (IPPS) Fiscal Year 2019 proposed
rule (83 FR 20528).  
As summarized in the IPPS Fiscal Year 2019 final rule (83 FR 41144), CMS
received comments  
supportive of using the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 medication history
transactions for PDMP  
queries and responses, as well as comments asking CMS to seek
harmonizing of the 2015  
Edition e-prescribing certification criterion to the NCPDP SCRIPT
2017071 standard specified  
in the part D program portions of the recent "Medicare Program; Contract
Year 2019 Policy and  
Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Cost Plan,
Medicare Fee-for-Service,  
the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs, and the PACE Program"
final rule (83 FR  
16440).

In addition to proposing to adopt the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard for
the transactions  
that are listed in the current “electronic prescribing” criterion (§
170.315(b)(3)), we propose to  
adopt and require conformance to all of the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071
standard transactions  
CMS adopted at 42 CFR 423.160(b)(2)(iv) for NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071.
Therefore, we propose  
to adopt a new 2015 Edition “electronic prescribing” criterion (§
170.315(b)(11)) that includes  
the following transactions:  
• **Create new prescriptions (NewRx, NewRxRequest,
NewRxResponseDenied)**  
A NewRx transaction is a new prescription from a prescriber to a
pharmacy so that it can  
be dispensed to a patient. A NewRxRequest is a request from a pharmacy
to a prescriber for a  
new prescription for a patient. A NewRxResponseDenied is a denied
response to a previously  
sent NewRxRequest (if approved, a NewRx would be sent). A
NewRxResponseDenied response  
may occur when the NewRxRequest cannot be processed or if information is
unavailable.  
• **Change prescriptions (RxChangeRequest, RxChangeResponse)**  
An RxChangeRequest transaction originates from a pharmacy to request: a
change in the  
original prescription (new or fillable), validation of prescriber
credentials, a prescriber to review  
the drug requested, or a prior authorization from the payer for the
prescription. An  
RxChangeResponse transaction originates from a prescriber to respond: to
a prescription change  
request from a pharmacy, to a request for a prior authorization from a
pharmacy, or to a  
prescriber credential validation request from a pharmacy.  
• **Cancel prescriptions (CancelRx, CancelRxResponse)**  
A CancelRx transaction is a request from a prescriber to a pharmacy to
not fill a  
previously sent prescription. A CancelRx must contain pertinent
information for the pharmacy to

be able to find the prescription in their system (patient, medication
(name, strength, dosage,  
form), prescriber, prescription number if available). A CancelRxResponse
is a response from a  
pharmacy to a prescriber to acknowledge a CancelRx, and is used to
denote if the cancellation is  
Approved or Denied.  
• **Renew prescriptions (RxRenewalRequest, RxRenewalResponse)**  
An RxRenewalRequest transaction originates from a pharmacy to request
additional  
refills beyond those originally prescribed. RxRenewalResponse originates
from a prescriber to  
respond to the request. ****  
• **Receive fill status notifications (RxFill,
RxFillIndicatorChange)**  
An RxFill transaction is sent from a pharmacy to a prescriber or a long
term or post-acute  
care (LTPAC) facility indicating the FillStatus (dispensed, partially
dispensed, not dispensed or  
returned to stock, transferred to another pharmacy) of the new, refill,
or resupply prescriptions  
for a patient. RxFillIndicator informs the pharmacy of the prescriber’s
intent for fill status  
notifications for a specific patient/medication. An
RxFillIndicatorChange is sent by a prescriber  
to a pharmacy to indicate that the prescriber is changing the types of
RxFill transactions that  
were previously requested, where the prescriber may modify the fill
status of transactions  
previously selected or cancel future RxFill transactions.  
• **Request and receive medication history (RxHistoryRequest,
RxHistoryResponse)**  
An RxHistoryRequest transaction is a request from a prescriber for a
list of medications  
that have been prescribed, dispensed, claimed, or indicated by a
patient. This request could be  
sent to a state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP). An
RxHistoryResponse is a  
response to an RxHistoryRequest containing a patient’s medication
history. It includes the

medications that were dispensed or obtained within a certain timeframe,
and optionally includes  
the prescriber that prescribed it. RxHistoryRequest and
RxHistoryResponse transactions may be  
sent directly or through an intermediary.  
• **Ask the Mailbox if there are any transactions (GetMessage)**  
This transaction is used by the prescriber or pharmacy asking the
mailbox if there are any  
transactions. It is at the heart of the mechanism used by a pharmacy or
prescriber system to  
receive transactions from each other or from a payer or the REMS
Administrator via a Switch,  
acting as a Mailbox.  
• **Relay acceptance of a transaction back to the sender (Status)**  
This transaction is used to relay acceptance of a transaction back to
the sender. A Status  
in response to any applicable transaction other than GetMessage
indicates acceptance and  
responsibility for a request. A Status in response to GetMessage
indicates that no mail is waiting  
for pickup. A Status cannot be mailboxed and may not contain an error.  
• **Respond that there was a problem with the transaction (Error)**  
This transaction indicates an error has occurred, indicating the request
was terminated.  
An Error can be generated when there is a communication problem or when
the transaction  
actually had an error. An error can be mailboxed, as it may be
signifying to the originator that a  
transaction was unable to be delivered or encountered problems in the
acceptance. The Error  
must be a different response than a Status, since the communication
between the system and the  
Mailbox must clearly denote the actions taking place. An Error is a
response being delivered on  
behalf of a previous transaction, and the Status signifies no more
mail.  
• **Respond that a transaction requesting a return receipt has been
received (Verify)**

This transaction is a response to a pharmacy or prescriber indicating
that a transaction  
requesting a return receipt has been received. Verifications results
when a “return receipt  
requested” flag is set in the original request. Upon receiving a
transaction with ReturnReceipt  
set, it is the responsibility of the receiver to either generate a
Verify in response to the request  
(recommended) or generate a Status in response to this request, followed
subsequently by a free  
standing Verify. This transaction notifies the originator that the
transaction was received at the  
software system. It is not a notification of action taking place, since
time may elapse before the  
ultimate answer to the transaction may take place.  
• **Request to send an additional supply of medication (Resupply)**  
This transaction is a request from a Long Term or Post-Acute Care
(LTPAC)  
organization to a pharmacy to send an additional supply of medication
for an existing order. An  
example use case is when a medication supply for a resident is running
low (2-3 doses) and a  
new supply is needed from the pharmacy, the LTPAC organization need a
way to notify the  
pharmacy that an additional supply for the medication is needed.  
• **Communicate drug administration events (DrugAdministration)**  
This transaction communicates drug administration events from a
prescriber/care facility  
to the pharmacy or other entity. It is a notification from a
prescriber/care facility to a pharmacy  
or other entity that a drug administration event has occurred - for
example, a medication was  
suspended or administration was resumed. ****  
• **Transfer one or more prescriptions (RxTransferRequest,
RxTransferResponse,**  
**RxTransferConfirm)**

The RxTransferRequest transaction is used when the pharmacy is asking
for a transfer of  
one or more prescriptions for a specific patient to the requesting
pharmacy. The  
RxTransferResponse transaction is the response to the RxTransferRequest
which includes the  
prescription(s) being transferred or a rejection of the transfer
request. It is sent from the  
transferring pharmacy to the requesting pharmacy. The RxTransferConfirm
transaction is used  
by the pharmacy receiving (originally requesting) the transfer to
confirm that the transfer  
prescription has been received and the transfer is complete.  
• **Recertify the continued administration of a medication order
(Recertification)**  
This transaction is a notification from a facility, on behalf of a
prescriber, to a pharmacy  
recertifying the continued administration of a medication order. An
example use is when an  
existing medication order has been recertified by the prescriber for
continued use. Long term or  
post-acute care use only.  
• **Complete Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)
Transactions**  
**(REMSInitiationRequest, REMSInitiationResponse, REMSRequest, and**  
**REMSResponse)**  
With CMS’ recent adoption of these transactions in their recently issued
final rule  
associated with e-prescribing for Medicare Part D (42 CFR
423.160(b)(2)(iv)(W)-(Z)), we  
believe that it would be equally beneficial to include these four REMS
transactions as part of this  
proposed certification criterion: REMSInitiationRequest,
REMSInitiationResponse,  
REMSRequest, and REMSResponse.  
The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA) of 2007 (Public
Law  
110-85) enables the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require a REMS

pharmaceutical manufacturer if the FDA determines that a REMS is
necessary to ensure the  
benefits of a drug outweigh the risks associated with the drug. The
currently approved REMS  
programs vary in levels of complexity. Typically a Med Guide and
Communication Plan is  
required, but some also require Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU). The
large majority of  
existing REMS programs are for drugs dispensed through specialty
pharmacies, clinics, and  
hospitals, but as REMS become more common they may ultimately have a
greater impact on  
retail-based products.  
The impact of REMS is twofold. First, REMS with ETASU may require the
pharmacist  
to verify prescriber, patient, and/or pharmacy enrollment in a registry
and, in some cases, verify  
or check certain information, such as lab results. Second, all REMS,
including those without  
ETASU, must fulfill FDA-approved reporting requirements. Each REMS
program must also  
include a program assessment schedule that examines the program’s
effectiveness on intervals  
approved by the FDA as part of the overall REMS program. The results of
these assessments are  
submitted to the FDA as part of the ongoing evaluation of REMS program
effectiveness.  
Accordingly, we propose to include the REMS transactions as part of this
proposed certification  
criterion. We would also note for commenters’ benefit that the SCRIPT
2017071 testing tool  
under development is being designed to support testing these REMS
transactions.  
We believe that removing the 2015 Edition certification criterion
(codified in §  
170.315(b)(3)) that references NCPDP SCRIPT version 10.6 and replacing
it with an updated e-  
prescribing criterion (proposed to be codified in § 170.315(b)(11))
would harmonize with  
relevant CMS program timelines, including Part D e-prescribing
requirements and the option for  
eligible clinicians, hospitals, and CAHs to report on the Query of
Prescription Drug Monitoring

Program (PDMP) quality measure for Promoting Interoperability Programs.
However, should  
our proposal to adopt the new e-prescribing criterion (§ 170.315(b)(11))
be finalized prior to  
January 1, 2020, we also propose to permit continued certification to
the current 2015 Edition  
“electronic prescribing” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(3)) for the period of
time in which it would  
continue to be used as a program standard in the CMS Medicare Part D
Program or the CMS  
Promoting Interoperability Programs. Once it is no longer used in those
Programs, we would no  
longer permit certification to that and would remove it from the Code of
Federal Regulations.  
We will consider setting an effective date for such actions in a
subsequent final rule based on  
stakeholder feedback and CMS policies at the time. To this point, we
note that the continued  
acceptability of a Health IT Module certified to the criterion codified
in § 170.315(b)(3) for  
purposes of meeting the CEHRT definition and participating in the CMS
Promoting  
Interoperability Programs would be a matter of CMS policy.  
3\. Clinical Quality Measures – Report Criterion  
  
In the 2015 Edition final rule, ONC adopted four clinical quality
measure (CQM)  
certification criteria, § 170.315(c)(1) CQMs – record and export, §
170.315(c)(2) CQMs –  
import and calculate, § 170.315(c)(3) CQMs – report, and § 170.315(c)(4)
CQMs – filter (80 FR  
62649-62655). These four criteria were adopted with the intent to
support providers’ quality  
improvement activities and in electronically generating CQM reports for
reporting with certified  
health IT to programs such as the EHR Incentive Programs, Quality
Payment Program, and  
Comprehensive Primary Care plus initiative. All four CQM criteria
require certified health IT to  
be capable of generating CQM reports using the HL7 Quality Reporting
Document Architecture  
(QRDA) Category I standard, which provides CQM reports for individual
patients. Specifically,

we adopted HL7 CDA® Release 2 Implementation Guide for: Quality
Reporting Document  
Architecture – Category I (QRDA I); Release 1, Draft Standard for Trial
Use (DSTU) Release 3  
(US Realm)), Volume 1 (§ 170.205(h)(2)). Two of the CQM criteria, CQMs –
report (§  
170.315(c)(3)) and CQMs – filter (§ 170.315(c)(4)), also require
certified health IT to be capable  
of generating CQM reports using the QRDA Category III standard, which
provides aggregate  
CQM reports for a set of patients. More specifically, we adopted QRDA
Category III,  
Implementation Guide for CDA Release 2 (§ 170.205(k)(1)) and the Errata
to the HL7  
Implementation Guide for CDA® Release 2: QRDA Category III, DSTU Release
1 (US Realm),  
September 2014 (§ 170.205(k)(2)).  
  
The “CQMs – report” certification criterion (§ 170.315(c)(3)) includes
an optional  
certification provision for demonstrating that the health IT can create
QRDA reports in the form  
and manner required for submission to CMS programs, which is in
accordance with CMS’  
QRDA Implementation Guide (IGs).[23](ONCs.html#86) The CMS QRDA IGs
include specific requirements to  
support providers participating in CMS programs in addition to the HL7
IGs. At the time of the  
finalization of the 2015 Edition final rule and in response to public
comment, we noted that there  
was mixed feedback on whether this criterion should require adherence to
the HL7 QRDA  
Category I and Category III standards or solely to the CMS QRDA IGs. As
such, we adopted an  
approach that allowed for flexibility and only required that certified
health IT support the HL7  
QRDA standards, which are program-agnostic and can support a number of
use cases for  
exchanging CQM data. Because the criterion has the optional provision
for CMS program-  
specific certification, developers can also support their end-users who
intend to use their
certified

health IT to report eCQMs to CMS in the “form and manner” CMS requires
(i.e., using the  
format specified in the CMS QRDA IGs) (80 FR 62652).  
  
Since the 2015 Edition final rule was published (October 16, 2015), we
have gained  
additional certification experience and received feedback from the
industry that health IT  
certified to the “CQMs-report” criterion (§ 170.315(c)(3)) are
only/primarily being used to  
submit eCQMs to CMS for participation in CMS programs. Therefore, as a
means of reducing  
burden, we propose to remove the HL7 QRDA standard requirements from the
2015 Edition  
CQMs – report criterion in § 170.315(c)(3), but *require* that health IT
certified to the criterion  
support the CMS QRDA IGs. This would directly reduce burden on health IT
developers and  
indirectly providers as they would no longer have to, in practice,
develop (health IT developers)  
and support (both developers and providers) two forms of the QRDA
standard (i.e., the HL7 and  
CMS forms). We note that the Fast Health Interoperability Resources
(FHIR) standard offers the  
potential for supporting quality improvement and reporting needs and
promises to be a more  
efficient, modular, and interoperable standard to develop, implement,
and utilize through APIs.  
However, until the potential benefits of FHIR APIs can be realized for
quality improvement and  
reporting, we believe that solely requiring the CMS QRDA IGs for the
“CQMs – report”  
criterion balances the burden to developers and providers, while still
meeting the goal of  
facilitating quality improvement and reporting to CMS.  
To support the proposal, we propose to incorporate by reference the
latest annual CMS  
QRDA IGs, specifically the 2019 CMS QRDA I Implementation Guide for
Hospital Quality

Reporting[24](ONCs.html#88)and the 2019 CMS QRDA III Implementation
Guide for Eligible Professionals (EPs)  
and Eligible Clinicians.[25](ONCs.html#88)A Health IT Module would need
to be certified to both standards to  
provide flexibility to providers. However, we solicit comment on whether
we should consider an  
approach that permits certification to only one of the standards
depending on the care setting for  
which the product is designed and implemented. We also solicit comment
on the future  
possibility of FHIR-enabled APIs replacing or complementing QRDA reports
for quality  
reporting and improvement.  
If we finalize this proposal in a subsequent final rule, we propose to
adopt the latest CMS  
QRDA IGs at the time of final rule publication, as CMS updates their
QRDA IGs annually to  
support the latest eCQM specifications and only accepts eCQM reporting
to the latest version.  
We note that this approach would also facilitate a means for ONC to
permit developers to update  
its certified health IT to newer versions of the CMS QRDA IGs through
the real world testing  
Maintenance of Certification provision for standards and implementation
specification updates in  
support of ongoing interoperability (*see* section VII.B.5 of this
proposed rule).  
4\. Electronic Health Information Export  
We propose to adopt a new 2015 Edition certification criterion for EHI
export in § ****  
170.315(b)(10). This criterion is intended to provide patients and
health IT users with a means to  
efficiently export the entire electronic health record for a single
patient or all patients in a  
computable, electronic format, and facilitate the receiving health IT
system’s interpretation and  
use of the EHI, to the extent reasonably practicable using the
developer’s existing
technology.

This outcome would promote access, exchange, and use of EHI and
facilitate health care  
providers’ ability to switch health IT systems or to migrate EHI for use
in other technologies.  
Additionally, as discussed in section VII.B.2 of this preamble,
certification to this criterion  
would provide some degree of assurance that a health IT developer
supports, and does not  
inhibit, the access, exchange, and use of EHI for the specific use cases
that the criterion  
addresses.  
This proposed criterion supports two specific use cases for which we
believe that all EHI  
produced and electronically managed in a developer’s technology should
be made readily  
available for export as a standard capability of certified health IT.  
First, we propose that health IT certified to this criterion would have
to enable the export  
of EHI for a single patient upon a valid request from that patient or a
user on the patient’s behalf.  
This patient-focused export capability, which is discussed in more
detail below, complements  
other provisions of this proposed rule that support patients’ access to
their EHI including  
information that may eventually be accessible via the APIs described in
section VII.B.4 of this  
preamble. Ultimately, we expect all data to be transferred through APIs
or other advanced  
technologies. EHI export also supports longitudinal data record
development, and aligns with  
section 4006(a) of the Cures Act, which requires \[t\]he Secretary, in
consultation with the  
National Coordinator, \[to\] promote policies that ensure that a
patient’s EHI is accessible to that  
patient and the patient’s designees, in a manner that facilitates
communication with the patient’s  
health care providers and other individuals, including researchers,
consistent with such patient’s  
consent.

<span id="90"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **90** of **724**  
  
Second, this criterion would support the export of EHI when a health
care provider  
chooses to transition or migrate information to another health IT
system. As discussed in section  
VIII.C.5.c.iii of this preamble, health IT developers are in a unique
position to block the export  
and portability of data for use in competing systems or applications, or
to charge rents for access  
to the basic technical information needed to facilitate the conversion
or migration of data for  
these purposes. By providing at least a baseline capability for
exporting EHI in a commercially  
reasonable format, we believe that this criterion would help to address
some of these business  
practices and enable smoother transitions between health IT systems.  
This criterion is intended to further the two use cases outlined above
while providing an  
incremental approach given the known and anticipated health IT landscape
when ONC expects  
certified health IT with this functionality will be widely available in
the ecosystem. At the time  
of this rulemaking, we believe a focused certification criterion that is
standards-agnostic will  
provide a useful first step to enabling patients to request and receive
their EHI and for providers  
to more readily switch or migrate information between health IT systems.
Understanding that  
open, standards-based APIs are an emerging technology and that some
health IT developers  
today have implemented proprietary APIs, this proposed criterion for EHI
export provides an  
initial method for exporting patient health information in these
circumstances. Over time, ONC  
may consider expanding the proposed criterion or replacing it to achieve
the goals in § **** 170.402.  
It is also possible that in the future, this criterion will no longer be
needed once standards-based  
APIs are widely available in the health IT ecosystem with the ability to
facilitate exchange of a  
wider set of standardized data elements per the predictable,
transparent, and collaborative

process to expand the USCDI (*see* the discussion of the API Condition
of Certification and the  
proposed API criterion in § **** 170.315(g)(10) in VII.B.4 for
additional information).  
a. Patient Access  
  
As noted above, the export functionality required by this certification
criterion would  
support both a patient’s access to their EHI and a provider’s ability to
switch to another health IT  
system. In the patient access context, we propose that a user must be
able to timely execute the  
single patient EHI export at any time the user chooses and without
subsequent developer  
assistance to operate. The health IT developer should enable the user to
make data requests and  
receive the export efficiently, without unreasonable burden. For
example, the health IT developer  
should not: require the user to make a request multiple times for
different types of EHI; provide  
unreasonable delays for the export; or prohibit reasonable user access
to the system during the  
export process.  
“Timely” does not mean real-time; however, we stress that any delays in
providing the  
export must be no longer than reasonably necessary to avoid interference
with other clinical  
functions of the health IT system. This is similar to the approach we
have taken for export of  
clinical quality measure data. The export capability does not require
that data be received  
instantaneously. Rather, as we have stated before (80 FR 62650) a
non-conformity would exist if  
surveillance revealed that processing or other delays were likely to
substantially interfere with  
the ability of a provider or health system to view and verify their CQM
results for quality  
improvement on a near real-time basis. Similarly, a non-conformity would
exist if delays were  
causing or contributing to users being presented with data files that no
longer contained current,  
accurate, or valid data. To avoid these implementation issues and ensure
that capabilities support

all required outcomes, health IT developers should seek to minimize
processing times and other  
delays to the greatest extent possible.[26](ONCs.html#92)  
As previously defined under the Program, “user” is a health care
professional or his or  
her office staff; or a software program or service that would interact
directly with the certified  
health IT (80 FR 62611, 77 FR 54168). We typically would expect the
“user” in this case to be a  
provider or his or her office staff who will be performing the request
on behalf of the patient  
given that a request of this nature would likely occur in the context of
an individual exercising  
their right of access under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164.524). In
this regard, the  
proposed 2015 Edition “EHI export” criterion could facilitate and
support the provision of a  
patient’s record in an electronic format. In service to innovative and
patient-centric approaches, a  
health IT developer could develop a method that allows the patient using
a technology  
application (e.g., portal or “app”) to execute the request without
needing a provider to do so on  
their behalf. We seek comment on whether this portion of the criterion
should be made more  
prescriptive to *only* allow the patient and his or her authorized
representative to be the requestor  
of their EHI, similar to how we have previously scoped such criteria as
“view, download, and  
transmit to 3rd party” (§ **** 170.315(e)(1)).  
Similar to the 2015 Edition “data export” certification criterion (**§**
170.315(b)(6)), which  
we propose for removal below, we acknowledge potential privacy and
security concerns may  
arise when EHI is exported and, therefore, propose that for
provider-mediated requests, a  
developer may design the health IT to limit the type of users that would
be able to access and  
initiate EHI export functions. However, as we previously specified in
the 2015 Edition final
rule,

<span id="93"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **93** of **724**  
  
the ability to “limit” the single patient EHI export functionality is
intended to be used by and at  
the discretion of the provider organization implementing the technology,
not a way for health IT  
developers to implicitly prevent the overarching user-driven aspect of
this capability (80 FR  
62646).  
b. Transitions Between Health IT Systems  
In addition to and separate from the patient access use case described
above, health IT  
certified to this criterion would facilitate the migration of EHI to
another health IT system. We  
propose that a health IT developer of health IT certified to this
criterion must, at a customer’s  
request, provide a complete export of all EHI that is produced or
managed by means of the  
developer’s certified health IT. Health IT developers would have
flexibility as to how this  
outcome is achieved, so long as a customer is able to receive the export
in a timely and efficient  
manner, and in a format that is commercially reasonable. For example, in
contrast with the  
patient export capability, which must be available to a user without
subsequent developer  
assistance to operate, the “database export” capability of this
criterion could require action or  
support on the part of the health IT developer.  
We note that while this criterion focuses on the technical outcomes
supported by this  
capability, developers of health IT certified to this criterion would be
required to provide the  
assurances proposed in § 170.402, which include providing reasonable
cooperation and  
assistance to other persons (including customers, users, and third-party
developers) to enable the  
use of interoperable products and services. Thus, while developers would
have flexibility as to  
how they implement the export functionality for transitions between
systems, they would  
ultimately be responsible for ensuring that the capability is deployed
in a way that enables a

customer and their third-party contractors to successfully migrate data.
Such cooperation and  
assistance could include, for example, assisting a customer’s
third-party developer to automate  
the export of EHI to other systems. We refer readers to section VII.B.2
of the proposed rule for  
further discussion of a health IT developer’s assurances as proposed in
§ 170.402.  
c. Scope of EHI  
For both use cases supported by this criterion, EHI export encompasses
all the EHI that  
the health IT system produces and electronically manages for a patient
or group of patients. This  
applies to the health IT’s entire database, including but not limited to
clinical, administrative, and  
claims/billing data. It would also include any data that may be stored
in separate data warehouses  
that the system has access to, can produce, and electronically manages.
For example, health IT  
developers may store EHI in these warehouses to prevent performance
impacts from data queries  
that may slow down the “main” health IT system’s (e.g., EHR) clinical
performance. We clarify  
that “EHI” also includes the oldest EHI available on that patient to the
most recent, no matter the  
specific electronic format (e.g., PDFs are included). As mentioned
above, our intention is that  
“produces and electronically manages” refers to a health IT product’s
entire database. However,  
we seek comment on the terminology used (“produces and electronically
manages”) and whether  
that captures our intent or whether there are any alternatives to the
language we should consider  
to further clarify our intent. Alternative language we considered
included “produce and  
electronically retain” data, which could encompass more data.  
The use of the term “electronic health information” (EHI) is deliberate
and in alignment  
with the Cures Act and the proposed definition of this term in § ****
170.102. Its use supports  
consistency and the breadth of types of data envisioned by this
criterion. Clinical data would

encompass imaging information – both images and narrative text about the
image – as this is part  
of the patient’s total record; however, we understand that EHRs may not
be the standard storage  
location for images and solicit comment on the feasibility,
practicality, and necessity of  
exporting images and/or imaging information. We request comment on what
image elements, at  
a minimum, should be shared such as image quality, type, and narrative
text. It is understandable  
that developers will not be able to export every existing data element,
nor that all possible data  
elements are necessary for transfer. For finalization in a subsequent
final rule, we solicit  
comment on whether we should require, to support transparency, health IT
developers to attest or  
publish as part of the export format documentation the types of EHI they
cannot support for  
export.  
We also propose the following metadata categories that would be excluded
from this  
criterion, and have listed examples for clarity below. We seek comment
on these exclusion  
categories, and request feedback on what metadata elements should remain
included for export,  
or be added to the list of data that would be allowed to be excluded in
a subsequent final rule:  
• Metadata present in internal databases used for physically storing the
data. Examples include:  
internal database table names, field names, schema, constraints,
Triggers, Field size (number  
of bytes), Field type (String, integer, double, long), and Primary keys
or object identifiers  
used internally for querying.  
• Metadata that may not be necessary to interpret EHI export, including
information that is  
typically required for processing of transactions such as encryption
keys, internal user roles,  
ancillary information such as information stored in different formats,
local codes for internal  
use; audit logs, record reviews, or history of change.

<span id="96"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **96** of **724**  
  
• Metadata that refers to data that is not present in the EHI export,
such as links to files and  
other external attachments that are not part of the export, and
information used in conjunction  
with data from other applications that is not part of the health IT.  
We also seek comment, for consideration in finalizing this criterion in
a subsequent final  
rule, on types of EHI that may present challenges for meeting the intent
of this proposed  
criterion.  
d. Export Format  
The proposed certification criterion does not prescribe a content
standard for the EHI  
export. However, it requires health IT developers to provide the format,
such as a data dictionary  
or export support file, for the exported information to assist the
receiving system in processing  
the EHI without loss of information or its meaning to the extent
reasonably practicable using the  
developer’s existing technology. Providing EHI export information is
consistent with emerging  
industry practices and capabilities to offer requestors the ability to
access, download, and move  
their information without unreasonable burden. Companies such as
Facebook,[27](ONCs.html#96)Google,[28](ONCs.html#96)and  
Twitter[29](ONCs.html#96) offer publicly-available links which provide
requestors necessary information on how  
to download their personal information including, in some cases, several
download options for  
requestors alongside their export instructions. Public access to
comparable EHI export  
information would further support third-party companies in this space,
as they would have  
additional information and general knowledge for use of available data.
Accordingly, we propose  
that the developer’s export format should be made publicly available via
a hyperlink as part
of

certification to the “EHI export” criterion, including keeping the
hyperlink up-to-date with the  
current export format.  
We believe that by making the export format publicly available at the
time of certification  
(and keeping the information current) will stimulate a vibrant,
competitive market in which third-  
party software developers can specialize in processing the data exported
from certified health IT  
products in support of patients and providers. Moreover, we believe this
proposal will transform  
today’s current guess-work, one-off processes into something more
predictable and transparent  
such that greater industry efficiencies can be realized. We note and
clarify that the export format  
need not be the same format used internally by the health IT system, and
the health IT developer  
would not need to make public their proprietary data model. The proposed
certification criterion  
also does not prescribe how the exported EHI is made available to the
user, as this may depend  
on the size and type of information. We would expect that the
information be made available to  
the user or requestor in an acceptable manner without placing
unreasonable burden on the user or  
requestor. Please also generally see our discussion of information
blocking in section VIII and  
particularly section VIII.D.5.  
e. Initial Step to Persistent Access to All of a Patient’s EHI  
We believe that open, standards-based APIs should provide persistent
access to patients’  
EHI over time to achieve the envisioned goals in § **** 170.404. In the
meantime, this proposed  
criterion in § **** 170.315(b)(10) will provide an initial step toward
achieving those goals. We clarify  
that “persistent” or “continuous” access to EHI is not required to
satisfy this criterion’s  
requirements and that the minimum requirement is for a discrete data
export capability.  
Similarly, while the criterion requires the timely export of all EHI,
such export need not occur

instantaneously (or in “real-time”). However, health IT developers are
encouraged to consider  
persistent access and real-time approaches as part of the step-wise
progression we see towards  
open, standards-based APIs for a growing number of data elements per the
USCDI in the  
proposed “standardized API for patient and population services”
criterion (§ **** 170.315(g)(10).”  
Further, we caution that where it is reasonable for a developer to
provide persistent or real-time  
access to electronic health information, the refusal to do so may be
inconsistent with the  
Conditions of Certification in § 170.401 (information blocking) and §
170.402 (assurances  
related to this capability), as well as the information blocking
provision, as to which readers  
should refer to sections VII and VIII of this proposed rule. Similarly,
while this certification  
criterion would provide a baseline capability for exporting data for the
specific use cases  
described above, health IT developers may need to provide other data
export and conversion  
services or support additional export use cases beyond those encompassed
by this criterion to  
facilitate the appropriate access, exchange, and use of electronic
health information and to avoid  
engaging in information blocking.  
f. Timeframes  
ONC seeks input on EHI export and timeframes. In particular, beyond
exporting  
*all* the EHI the health IT system produces and electronically manages,
should this  
criterion include capabilities to permit health care providers to set
timeframes for EHI  
export, such as only the “past two years” or “past month” of EHI?  
For discussion of the required timeframe for developers of certified
health IT *to certify to*  
*this proposed criterion and make it available to their customers*,

which addresses a health IT developer’s required assurances regarding

provision of this EHI export capability to its customers.  
g. Replaces the 2015 Edition “Data Export” Criterion in the 2015 Edition
Base  
EHR Definition  
We propose to remove the “data export” criterion (§ **** 170.315(b)(6))
from the 2015  
Edition, including the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition expressed in §
170.102.  
Correspondingly, we propose to include the proposed “EHI export”
criterion (§ **** 170.315(b)(10))  
in the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition, which would affect health care
providers’ compliance  
responsibilities when it comes to possessing CEHRT for associated CMS
programs. A specific  
C-CDA data export criterion no longer supports advancements in
interoperability in the evolving  
health IT industry. The proposed “EHI export” certification criterion is
standards-agnostic and  
supports a more open approach to interoperability. More specifically,
the proposed “EHI export”  
criterion differs significantly from the “data export” certification
criterion as the latter is limited  
to clinical data as specified in the C-CDA. Also, the proposed “EHI
export” criterion is not  
limited to just the scope of the certified capabilities in the certified
Health IT Module as it  
applies to all produced and electronically managed EHI. Further, by
including this functionality  
in the 2015 Base EHR definition, we can be assured that health care
providers participating in  
the CMS programs (e.g., Promoting Interoperability Programs) have
functionality to both  
support patient requests for their EHI and switching health IT
systems.  
We propose to modify the Base EHR definition to include the proposed
“EHI export”  
criterion 24 months from the effective date of the final rule for this
proposed rule (which  
practically speaking would be 25 months because of the 30-day delayed
effective date). We

<span id="100"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **100** of **724**  
  
believe this is sufficient time for health IT developers to develop,
test, certify, and rollout this  
functionality to health care providers based on the flexible approach
offered for meeting this  
criterion. We also believe this timeframe provides sufficient time for
health care providers to  
adopt and implement the functionality included in the “EHI export”
criterion. To note, we refer  
readers to the “Assurances” Condition and Maintenance of Certification
requirements in section  
VII.B.2, which propose complementary requirements on health IT
developers to rollout health IT  
certified “EHI export” within 24 months of the effective date of a final
rule for this proposed  
rule. We welcome comments on our proposed compliance timeline.  
We note that we do not propose a transition period for the “data export”
criterion. We  
propose to remove the criterion from the 2015 Edition upon the effective
date of a final rule for  
this proposed rule. Unlike the “application access – data category
request” criterion (which we  
propose to replace with the new API criterion in this proposed rule),
the “data export” criterion  
does not support an objective or measure under the CMS Promoting
Interoperability Programs.  
Therefore, we do not believe that health IT developers and health care
providers need to support  
the functionality in the “data export” criterion while they transition
to the development, adoption,  
and implementation of the EHI export criterion. This approach should
reduce burden and costs  
for both health IT developers and health care providers. We welcome
comments on this  
approach, including whether this will leave health care providers
without an export capability for  
an inordinate period of time such that we should require health IT
developers to support the “data  
export” functionality for health care providers until the health IT
developer attests to providing  
the new EHI export functionality to all of its customers.

proposed rule for a discussion of the estimated costs and benefits of
this proposed criterion, as

export” criterion.  
5\. Standardized API for Patient and Population Services Criterion  
To implement the Cures Act, we propose to adopt a new API criterion in
§  
170.315(g)(10), which would replace the “application access – data
category request”  
certification criterion (§ 170.315(g)(8)) and become part of the 2015
Edition Base EHR  
definition. This new certification criterion would require the use of
FHIR standards, several  
implementation specifications, and focus on supporting two types of
API-enabled services: (1)  
services for which a single patient’s data is at focus; and (2) services
for which multiple patients’  
data are at focus. Please refer to the “Application Programming
Interfaces” section (VII.B.4) in  
this preamble for a more detailed discussion of the “API” certification
criterion and related  
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements.  
6\. Privacy and Security Transparency Attestations  
  
  
a. Background  
In 2015, the HIT Standards Committee (HITSC) recommended the adoption of
two new  
certification criteria for the Program. The National Coordinator
endorsed the HITSC  
recommendations for consideration by the Secretary, and the Secretary
determined that it was  
appropriate to propose adoption of the two new certification criteria
through rulemaking (81 FR  
10635). To implement the Secretary’s determination, we propose to add
two new 2015 Edition  
privacy and security “transparency attestation” certification criteria
for: (1) encrypt  
authentication credentials; and (2) multi-factor authentication.  
****  
**NOTICE**

Federal Register (OFR) for publication and

<span id="102"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **102** of **724**  
  
In the 2015 Edition final rule, we adopted a new, simpler, and
straightforward approach  
to privacy and security (P\&S) certification requirements for Health IT
Modules certified to the  
2015 Edition, which we refer to as the 2015 Edition privacy and security
certification framework  
(80 FR 62705). In this proposed rule, we propose modifications to the
2015 Edition privacy and  
security certification framework in § 170.550(h) and propose to add new
criteria to which a  
health IT developer would need to certify pertaining to whether or not
its product encrypts  
authentication credentials (specifically § 170.315(d)(12)) and supports
multi-factor  
authentication (specifically § 170.315(d)(13)). To be clear, we are not
proposing to require that  
health IT *have* the functionality present to encrypt authentication
credentials or support multi-  
factor authentication. Rather, we propose that a health IT developer
indicate whether or not their  
certified health IT has those capabilities by attesting yes or no.  
  
  
b. Encrypt Authentication Credentials  
We propose to adopt an “encrypt authentication credentials”
certification criterion in §  
170.315(d)(12) and include it in the P\&S certification framework (§
170.550(h)). We propose to  
make the encrypt authentication credentials certification criterion
applicable to any Health IT  
Module currently certified to the 2015 Edition and any Health IT Module
presented for  
certification due to the fact that all health IT must meet the
“authentication, access control, and  
authorization” certification criterion adopted in § 170.315(d)(1) as
part of current Program  
requirements. While the 2015 Edition “authentication, access control,
and authorization”  
certification criterion criteria requires that patient information saved
on end user devices is  
encrypted, those same protections are not explicitly required through
certification for the  
authentication credentials ** used to access that same information. As
such, we believe that this

proposal would address that gap and encourage health IT developers to
take steps to ensure that  
authentication credentials are protected consistent with industry best
practices.  
To provide clarity as to what a “yes” attestation for “encrypt
authentication credentials”  
would mean, we provide the following explanation. Encrypting
authentication credentials could  
include password encryption or cryptographic hashing, which is storing
only encrypted or  
cryptographically hashed passwords. If a developer attests that its
Health IT Module encrypts  
authentication credentials, we propose that the attestation would mean
that the Health IT Module  
is capable of cryptographically protecting stored authentication
credentials in accordance with  
standards adopted in § 170.210(a)(2), Annex A: Federal Information
Processing Standards  
(FIPS) Publication 140-2, Approved Security Functions for FIPS PUB
140-2, Security  
Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. We posit that FIPS Publication
140-2 is the seminal,  
comprehensive, and most appropriate standard. Moreover, in the specified
FIPS 140-2 standard,  
there is an allowance for various approved encryption methods, and
health IT developers would  
have the flexibility to implement any of the approved encryption methods
in order to attest yes to  
this criterion. Health IT developers should keep apprised of these
standards as they evolve and  
are updated to address vulnerabilities identified in the current
standard.  
We do not believe it is necessary for a Health IT Module to be required
to be tested to  
this criterion, so long as by attesting yes to this criterion, the
health IT developer is attesting that  
if authentication credentials are stored, then the authentication
credentials are protected  
consistent with the requirements above. To be clear, a “no” attestation
is a sufficient response to  
address this certification criterion; however, health IT developers
should be aware that this “no”  
will be made publicly available on the CHPL. Note that if a developer
attested to encrypting

authentication credentials, a certified Health IT Module would be
subject to ONC-ACB  
surveillance for any potential non-conformity with the requirements of
this criterion.  
Specifically, if the ONC-ACB becomes aware of situations where the
developer’s health IT is  
not meeting the developer’s affirmative attestation per the criterion’s
requirements, the ONC-  
ACB may use its corrective action process to bring the product back into
conformance.  
We propose that, for health IT certified prior to a subsequent final
rule’s effective date,  
the health IT would need to be certified to the “encrypt authentication
credentials” certification  
criterion within six months after the final rule’s effective date. For
health IT certified for the first  
time after the final rule’s effective date, we propose that the health
IT must meet this criterion at  
the time of certification. This should allow sufficient time for health
IT developers to assess their  
Health IT Modules’ capabilities and attest “yes” or “no” to the
certification criterion.  
For an assessment of this proposal’s costs and benefits, please refer to
the Regulatory  
Impact Analysis in section XIV of this preamble. We welcome comments on
this assessment and  
this proposal in general. We also note that some health IT presented for
certification is not  
designed to store authentication credentials. Therefore, we specifically
request comment on  
whether we should include an explicit provision in this criterion to
accommodate such health IT.  
This could be similar to the approach we have taken with the 2015
Edition “end-user device  
encryption” criterion (§ 170.315(d)(7)(ii)), where we permit the
criterion to be met if the health  
IT developer indicates their technology is designed to prevent
electronic health information from  
being locally stored on end-user devices.

We propose to adopt a “multi-factor authentication” (MFA) criterion in §
170.315(d)(13)  
and include it in the P\&S certification framework (§ 170.550(h)). ****
We propose to make the  
“multi-factor authentication” certification criterion applicable to any
Health IT Module currently  
certified to the 2015 Edition and any Health IT Module presented for
certification. Health IT  
developers have already been implementing MFA to meet the Electronic
Prescribing of  
Controlled Substances (EPCS) requirements set by Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA),  
and if adopted, this certification criterion would be general in that
its intended outcome would  
provide more public transparency around the MFA capabilities included in
certified health IT.  
This proposal supports the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) led
initiative  
“STOP, THINK, CONNECT” which strongly recommends and runs campaigns to
promote  
stronger authentication, typically related to MFA, going beyond a
username and password to log  
in. MFA is also recommended by numerous organizations and groups. In the
“Report on  
Improving Cybersecurity in the Health Care
Industry,”[30](ONCs.html#105)the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity  
Task Force recommended requiring strong authentication to improve
identity and access  
management for health care workers, patients, and medical devices/EHRs.
Using a single factor  
approach to accessing information is particularly prone to cyber-attack
because one factor  
passwords can be weak, stolen, and are vulnerable to external phishing
attacks, malware, and  
social engineering threats. In situations where the provider is
accessing a health IT product or  
health information exchange external to the hospital or clinical
environment, the Health Care  
Industry Cybersecurity Task Force recommended that the health care
industry adopt the NIST

800-46 guidelines for remote access, including the use of two-factor
authentication to ensure a  
compromised password cannot alone be used to gain access. Promoting the
use of MFA and  
leveraging biometrics, mobile phones, and/or wearables can help to
establish a trust relationship  
with the patient. Additionally, NIST recommends any personal data,
whether self-asserted or  
validated, require MFA.  
However, despite the benefits of adopting MFA, we are also aware of some
of the  
challenges. Specifically, in health care, many providers are resistant
to adopt MFA because of  
the inconvenience and loss of time of going through another step to
access the patient’s EHI.  
Also, MFA has not been deployed very long in the health care setting, so
it is not clear how  
much it actually addresses the risk. In most MFA implementations,
passwords are still present. In  
addition to having to manage passwords, users also have to manage an
additional layer of  
security. Another usability challenge is that systems often require
different types of MFA, which  
adds to the complexity and also may require providers to keep track of
tokens. MFA is often  
recommended as a solution to password problems, but it is still
vulnerable to theft. These  
alternative forms of authentication have their own set of vulnerability
issues. The cost of  
implementing MFA and ensuring it will be implemented in a way that does
not inhibit clinical  
workflow is also an issue to be considered.  
To provide clarity as to what a “yes” attestation for “multi-factor
authentication”  
attestation would mean, we provide the following explanation. MFA
requires users to  
authenticate using multiple means to confirm they are who they claim to
be in order to prove  
one’s identity, under the assumption that it is unlikely that an
unauthorized individual or entity  
will be able to succeed when more than one token is required. MFA
includes using two or more

of these: (i) something people know, such as a password or a personal
identification number  
(PIN); (ii) something people have, such as a phone, badge, card, RSA
token or access key; and  
(iii) something people are, such as fingerprints, retina scan,
heartbeat, and other biometric  
information. Thus, in order to be issued a certification, we propose to
require that a Health IT  
Module developer attest to whether or not its certified health IT
supports MFA consistent with  
industry recognized standards (e.g., NIST Special Publication 800-63B
Digital Authentication  
Guidelines, ISO 27001).  
We propose that, for health IT certified prior to a subsequent final
rule’s effective date,  
the health IT would need to be certified to the “multi-factor
authentication” certification criterion  
within six months after the final rule’s effective date. For health IT
certified for the first time  
after the final rule’s effective date, we propose that the health IT
must meet this criterion at the  
time of certification. This should allow sufficient time for health IT
developers to assess their  
Health IT Modules’ capabilities and attest “yes” or “no” to the
certification criterion.  
We generally seek comment on whether there is value in adopting the
proposed “multi-  
factor authentication” criterion. We also solicit comment on the method
of attestation and, if the  
health IT developer does attest to supporting MFA, whether we should
require the health IT  
developer to explain how they support MFA. For example, should the
health IT developer be  
required to identify the MFA technique(s) used/supported by submitting
specific information on  
how it is implemented, including identifying the purpose(s)/use(s) to
which MFA is applied  
within their Health IT Module (such as where in the clinical workflow it
is required), and, as  
applicable, whether the MFA solution complies with industry standard?
This information could  
enable the health IT developer to highlight their health IT’s
capabilities to support MFA.

7\. Data Segmentation for Privacy and Consent Management Criteria  
We adopted two 2015 Edition “data segmentation for privacy” (DS4P)
certification  
criteria in the 2015 Edition final rule. One criterion (“DS4P-send” (§
170.315(b)(7)) includes  
capabilities for creating a summary care record formatted to the C-CDA
2.1 standard and  
document-level tagging as restricted (and subject to restrictions on
re-disclosure) according to  
the DS4P standard. The other criterion (“DS4P-receive” (§ 170.315(b)(8))
includes capabilities  
for receiving a summary care record formatted to the C-CDA 2.1 standard
and document-level  
tagged as restricted (and subject to restrictions on re-disclosure)
according to the DS4P standard.  
As noted in the 2015 Edition final rule (80 FR 62646)), certification to
these criteria is not  
required to meet the CEHRT definition for CMS EHR Incentive Programs,
now referred to as the  
Promoting Interoperability Programs. The current 2015 Edition DS4P
certification criteria  
specify the technical capabilities that the health IT must have to apply
and recognize security  
labels in a summary document (C-CDA) such that the recipient of a
summary document would  
be able to recognize the existence of sensitive elements within the
summary document (80 FR  
62646). Security labeling provides a way for computer systems to
properly handle data passed  
among systems, to preserve the condition of security, and to enable
access control decisions on  
the information, so that the information is only accessed by the
appropriate entities. The HL7  
Healthcare Classification System (HCS) standard provides a common syntax
and semantics for  
interoperable security labels in health care. The DS4P standard makes
use of the HCS  
specification and describes a method for applying security labels to HL7
CDA documents to  
ensure that privacy policies established at a record’s source can be
understood and enforced by  
the recipient of the record.

In the 2015 Edition final rule, we noted that the DS4P standard is not
restricted to data  
subject to the federal regulations governing the Confidentiality of
Substance Use Disorder  
Patient Records (42 CFR part 2) (80 FR 62647). It may be implemented to
support other data  
exchange use cases in which compliance with state or federal legal
frameworks require sensitive  
health information to be tagged and segmented (80 FR 62647). We further
stated that we offered  
certification to these criteria as an initial step towards the ability
of an interoperable health care  
system to use technical standards to compute and persist security labels
to permit access, use, or  
disclosure of protected health information in accordance with applicable
policies and patient  
preferences. We understood and acknowledged additional challenges
surrounding the prevalence  
of unstructured data, sensitive images, and potential issues around use
of sensitive health  
information by clinical decision support systems. The adoption of
document level data  
segmentation for structured documents would not solve these issues, but
we acknowledged it  
would help move technology in the direction where these issues could be
addressed (80 FR  
16841).  
Adoption of the current 2015 Edition DS4P criteria was also consistent
with earlier HIT  
Policy Committee (HITPC) recommendations on the use of DS4P technology
to enable the  
electronic implementation and management of disclosure policies that
originate from the patient,  
the law, or an organization, in an interoperable manner, so that
electronic sensitive health  
information may be appropriately shared.[31](ONCs.html#109) These HITPC
recommendations consisted of a glide

path for the exchange of 42 CFR part 2-protected data starting with the
inclusion of Level 1  
(document level tagging) send and receive functionality. The HITPC also
recommended  
advancing the exchange of 42 CFR part 2-protected data, by outlining
additional capabilities in  
sharing, viewing and incorporating privacy restricted data at a more
granular level, as well as  
managing computable patient consent for the use of restricted
data.[32](ONCs.html#110)  
Since the 2015 Edition final rule, the health care industry has engaged
in additional field  
testing and implementation of the DS4P standard. As of the beginning of
the third quarter of the  
2018 CY, only about 20 products (products with multiple certified
versions were counted once)  
were certified to the current 2015 Edition DS4P certification criteria.
In addition, stakeholders  
shared with ONC – through public forums, listening sessions, and
correspondence – that  
focusing certification on segmentation to only the document level does
not permit providers the  
flexibility to address more granular segmentation needs. Stakeholders
noted that certain provider  
types, such as providers of pediatric care and behavioral health care,
are currently using a range  
of burdensome manual workflows in order to meet complex use cases for
DS4P which are also  
impacted by state and local laws. Additionally, stakeholders have
expressed interest in ONC  
exploring health IT standards that work with DS4P to support the
management of consent for  
sharing documents that include security labels such as through the use
of an API.  
Therefore, in consideration of stakeholder feedback and our stated
policy approach to  
adopt DS4P certification criteria on a glide path, we propose to remove
the current 2015

DS4P-send (§ 170.315(b)(7)) and DS4P-receive (§ 170.315(b)(8))
certification criteria. The  
proposed effective date of removal of these criteria would be the
effective date of a subsequent  
final rule for this proposed rule. We propose to replace these two
criteria with three new 2015  
Edition DS4P certification criteria (two for C-CDA and one for a
FHIR-based API) that would  
support a more granular approach to privacy tagging data and consent
management for health  
information exchange supported by either the C-CDA– or FHIR-based
exchange standards. Our  
primary purpose for proposing to remove and replace them, in lieu of
proposing to revise them,  
is to provide clarity to stakeholders as to the additional functionality
enabled by health IT  
certified to the new criteria. We note resources released by ONC and
OCR, such as the HHS  
Security Risk Assessment Tool[33](ONCs.html#111)and the Guide to Privacy
and Security of Electronic Health  
Information,[34](ONCs.html#111)as well as the Office for Civil Rights'

may employ to make risk-based decisions regarding their implementation
of the proposed DS4P  
criteria. We also note the availability of the Electronic Consent
Management Landscape  
Assessment, Challenges, and Technology report.[36](ONCs.html#111)The
report includes suggestions for  
overcoming barriers associated with implementing electronic consent
management, which may  
be considered for further research and discussion.  
  
a. Implementation with the Consolidated CDA Release 2.1  
In place of the removed 2015 Edition DS4P criteria, we propose to adopt

C-CDA and the HL7 DS4P standard. These criteria would include
capabilities for applying the  
DS4P standard at the document, section, and entry level. We believe this
offers more valuable  
functionality to providers and patients, especially given the
complexities of the landscape of  
privacy laws for multiple care and specialty settings. We believe health
IT certified to these  
criteria could support multiple practice settings and use cases. For
example, in section VI.A.2 of  
this preamble, we explain how the proposed capabilities included in
these criteria could support  
the pediatric health care setting. We believe this proposal could also
reduce burden for providers  
by leveraging health IT’s ability to recognize and manage sensitive data
and patient consent  
directives, rather than relying on case-by-case manual redaction and
subsequent workarounds to  
transmit redacted documents. We emphasize that health care providers
already have processes  
and workflows to address their existing compliance obligations which
could be made more  
efficient and cost effective through the use of health IT. We recognize
that more granular privacy  
markings at the point of data capture would further support existing and
future priorities of states  
for multiple care and specialty settings, including behavioral health
and pediatric health care  
settings.  
We welcome public comment on our proposals to replace the current 2015
Edition DS4P  
criteria and adopt new 2015 Edition DS4P-send (§ 170.315(b)(12)) and
DS4P-receive  
(§ 170.315(b)(13)) criteria to support improved options for data
segmentation for health care  
providers engaged in complex use cases such as those identified in
pediatric care (*see also*  
section VI.A) and behavioral health care, including for opioid use
disorder (OUD) (*see also*  
section VI.B).

In collaboration with ONC, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services  
Administration (SAMHSA) developed the Consent2Share application to
address the specific  
privacy protections of patients with substance use disorders who are
covered by the federal  
confidentiality regulation, 42 CFR Part 2. Consent2Share is an open
source application for data  
segmentation and consent management. It is designed to integrate with
existing FHIR systems.  
SAMHSA created a FHIR implementation guide (the Consent2Share Consent
Profile Design,  
hereafter referred to as “Consent Implementation Guide”) that describes
how the Consent2Share  
(C2S) application and associated access control solution uses the FHIR
Consent resource to  
represent and persist patient consent for treatment, research, or
disclosure.[37](ONCs.html#113)The implementation  
guide provides instructions for using the FHIR Consent resource to
capture a record of a health  
care consumer’s privacy preferences.  
As discussed in section VII.B.4 of this proposed rule, we are proposing
policies related to  
the implementation of a standardized API to support the exchange of
health information between  
providers and patients and among members of a care team. We anticipate
that the proposed 2015  
Edition “standardized API for patient and population services”
certification criterion (§  
170.315(g)(10)) will result in a proliferation of APIs that will enable
a more flexible and less  
burdensome approach to exchanging EHI. We believe the health care
industry can leverage this  
API infrastructure to share segmented data in a secure and scalable
manner. Therefore, we  
propose to adopt a 2015 Edition certification criterion “consent
management for APIs” in §  
170.315(g)(11) to support data segmentation and consent management
through an API in

accordance with the Consent Implementation Guide. Certification to this
criterion would be at a  
health IT developer’s discretion and would indicate that a system is
capable of responding to  
requests through an API for patient consent directives that include
standards-based security  
labeling. ****  
We acknowledge that our proposed implementation specification, the
Consent  
Implementation Guide, is based on a different version of the FHIR
standard (FHIR Standard for  
Trial Use 3, also known as FHIR Release 3) than the proposed
“standardized API for patient and  
population services” criteria (§ 170.315(g)(10)) which is proposed to
reference just FHIR  
Release 2. Furthermore, we acknowledge that this discrepancy may result
in additional  
implementation efforts for developers. In ideal circumstances, we would
have proposed a data  
segmentation and consent management standard for APIs that was based on
FHIR Release 2 and  
aligned with the “standardized API for patient and population services”
criteria proposed in this  
proposed rule. However, although SAMHSA also created a consent
implementation guide based  
on FHIR Release 2,[38](ONCs.html#114)the guide used the FHIR “Contract”
resource to represent patient consent  
directives. It is our understanding that an approach based on the
“Contract” resource has since  
been abandoned by the industry in favor of using the “Consent” resource
which was introduced  
in FHIR Release 3. Moreover, the FHIR Release 2 version of the Consent
Implementation Guide  
went through relatively little testing and was never formally
implemented because SAMHSA  
began developing an update to the guide based on the “Consent” resource
in FHIR Release 3.  
Consequently, proposing an implementation specification based on FHIR
Release 2 would not

have aligned with the more common implementation of FHIR-based consent
directives by the  
health care industry. We do not anticipate that the initial misalignment
between the proposed  
API criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)) and the proposed third DS4P criterion
(§ 170.315(g)(11)) will  
pose a significant burden on health IT developers. Further, our proposal
to permit health IT  
developers to voluntarily implement and use a new version of an adopted
standard or  
implementation specification so long as such version was approved by the
National Coordinator  
for use in certification through the Standards Version Advancement
Process , discussed in  
section VII.B.5, would enable standards version alignment between these
two criteria in the  
future as the FHIR standard matures. ****  
SAMHSA created the “Consent Implementation Guide” to support developers
in  
implementing the FHIR Consent resource to represent patient consent for
treatment, research,  
and disclosure. The Consent Implementation Guide provides instructions
for using the FHIR  
“Consent” resource to capture a record of a health care consumer’s
privacy preferences.  
Implementing an instance of the FHIR Consent resource based on this
guide allows for a patient  
consent to permit or deny identified recipient(s) or recipient role(s)
to perform one or more  
actions, regarding the patient’s health information for specific
purposes and periods of time. For  
example the Consent Implementation Guide supports consent management for
specific use cases  
to permit or deny disclosure based on a specific law, regulation, or
policy under which the  
patient consented. The implementation guide uses security labels as a
mechanism for specifying  
a patient’s preferences (e.g., permit disclosure of EHI labeled
“restricted”). The Consent  
Implementation Guide provides a much simpler mechanism for representing
a patient’s consent

preferences than the old approach based on FHIR Release 2 and has
undergone implementation  
and pilot testing by SAMHSA’s Consent2Share (C2S) application.  
Our proposal to adopt the version aligned with FHIR Release 3 and the
FHIR Release 3  
standard for this criterion reflects stakeholder interests and efforts
to support particular use cases.  
C2S enables data segmentation and consent management for disclosure of
several discrete  
categories of sensitive health data related to conditions and treatments
including: alcohol,  
tobacco and substance use disorders (including opioid use disorder),
behavioral health,  
HIV/AIDS, and sexuality and reproductive health. These capabilities
support multiple use cases  
in both primary and specialty care, and specifically address priority
needs identified by  
stakeholders to support pediatric care. We emphasize that health care
providers already have  
processes and workflows to address their existing compliance obligations
which could be made  
more efficient and cost effective through the use of health IT. Finally,
given that the FHIR  
standard is modular in nature, and especially since the “Consent”
resource did not exist in FHIR  
Release 2, we anticipate that health IT developers that elect to certify
to this criterion would be  
able to support the Consent Implementation Guide along with the API
requirements specified in  
“standardized API for patient and population services” (§
170.315(g)(10)) with modest extra  
effort.  
We welcome comments on this proposal. We specifically seek comment on
how the  
availability of this proposed certification criterion might increase the
ability to support multiple  
care coordination and privacy priorities, including those associated
with pediatric care; and  
whether we should consider other similar API based options and resources
as standards for  
certification criteria. We also seek comment on whether the misalignment

of the FHIR standard used by our proposed “consent management for APIs”
and “standardized  
API for patient and population services” criteria would create excessive
burden for developers  
and implementers. Specifically, we seek comment on if certification to
the “consent management  
for APIs” should only be available in conjunction with the “standardized
API for patient and  
population services” criteria at such a time as the criteria are aligned
to one version of the FHIR  
standard or if the option to certify to the “consent management for
APIs” should be allowed for  
those developers interested in doing so even without current standards
alignment. We note that  
SAMHSA is currently pursuing additional work to expand use cases related
to data segmentation  
for privacy and FHIR compatibility. ****  
*C. Unchanged 2015 Edition Criteria – Program Reference Alignment*  
  
In the FY 2019 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (83 FR 20516), CMS proposed
scoring  
and measurement policies to move beyond the three stages of meaningful
use to a new phase of  
EHR measurement with an increased focus on interoperability and
improving patient access to  
health information. To reflect this focus, CMS changed the name of the
Medicare and Medicaid  
EHR Incentive Programs, to the Medicare and Medicaid Promoting
Interoperability (PI)  
Programs. To align with the renaming of the EHR Incentive Programs, we
propose to remove  
references to the EHR Incentive Programs and replace them with
“Promoting Interoperability  
Programs” in the 2015 Edition “automated numerator recording” criterion
in § 170.315(g)(1) and  
the “automated measure calculation” criterion in § 170.315(g)(2).

Currently, § 170.315(d)(2), “auditable events and tamper resistance,”
includes a cross-  
reference to § 170.315(d)(7). However, the cross reference to §
170.315(d)(7), “end-user device  
encryption,” does not always apply. We propose to revise § 170.550(h)(3)
to apply the §  
170.315(d)(7) cross reference as appropriate and exempt § 170.315(d)(7)
when the certificate  
scope does not require § 170.315(d)(7) certification (*see* §
170.315(d)(2)(i)(C)). Paragraph  
170.315(d)(2)(i)(C) is not applicable for the privacy and security
testing and certification of a  
Health IT Module required by § 170.550(h)(3)(iii), (v), (vii), and
(viii). This specific requirement  
was intended to be exempted. It would only apply if § 170.315(d)(7) was
also required for  
privacy and security testing and certification, which it is not under
the aforementioned  
paragraphs. For example, a developer that is seeking to certify a Health
IT Module to §  
170.315(h) will not necessarily have end-user device encryption features
(*see* § 170.315(d)(7)).  
As such, certification can proceed for the audit log process without the
Health IT Module  
demonstrating that it can record an encryption status as required by §
170.315(d)(2)(i)(C). We  
have previously identified this error in guidance and now propose to
codify the correction in  
regulation.[39](ONCs.html#118)  
  
  
2\. Amendments  
We propose to revise § 170.550(h) to remove the “amendments” criterion’s
application to  
certain non-applicable clinical criteria including: “drug-drug,
drug-allergy interaction checks for  
computerized provider order entry (CPOE)” § 170.315(a)(4); “clinical

certification to these  
criteria would not **** have to demonstrate the capabilities required by
the 2015 Edition  
“amendments” certification criterion (§ 170.315(d)(4)), unless the
health IT is presented for  
certification to another criterion that requires certification to the
2015 Edition “amendments”  
criterion under the P\&S certification framework. This has already been
incorporated into sub-  
regulatory guidance, and we propose to codify this clarification in
regulation.[40](ONCs.html#119)The revision was  
made upon further analysis of the P\&S certification framework and the
applicability of the  
“amendments” certification criterion § 170.315(d)(4) to health IT
capabilities that would not  
necessarily have any patient data for which a request for an amendment
would be relevant.  
  
3\. View, Download, and Transmit to 3rd Party  
We propose to remove § 170.315(e)(1)(ii)(B) which includes a
cross-reference to §  
170.315(d)(2). This cross-reference indicates that health IT may
demonstrate compliance with  
activity history log requirements if it is also certified to the 2015
Edition “auditable events and  
tamper-resistance” certification criterion (§ 170.315(d)(2)). However,
we no longer require  
testing of activity history log when certifying for § 170.315(d)(2).
Therefore, this cross-reference  
is no longer applicable to meet certification requirements for the 2015
Edition “view, download,  
and transmit to 3rd party” certification criterion (§ 170.315(e)(1))
activity history log  
requirements.

Consistent with the 2015 Edition privacy and security certification
framework, each  
certification criterion has a set of appropriate P\&S “safeguards” that
must be in place. In the  
2015 Edition, we required that an ONC–ACB must ensure that a Health IT
Module presented for  
certification to any of the certification criteria that fall into each
regulatory text “first level  
paragraph” category of § 170.315 (*e.g.*, § 170.315(a)) identified below
would be certified to  
either Approach 1 (technically demonstrate) or Approach 2 (system
documentation). In this  
proposed rule, we propose to require the new criteria (§ 170.315(d)(12)
and (d)(13)) to apply to  
all § 170.315 certification criteria. Therefore, given these and the
other modifications discussed  
above, we propose to revise the P\&S certification framework as noted in
the table below.  
However, the P\&S Certification Framework would need to be further
updated depending on  
finalization of the proposals discussed in section III.B.4, which
propose removal of certain 2015  
Edition certification criteria.

§ 170.315(a) through (h) Certification Criterion  
§ 170.315(d)(13)  
An ONC-ACB must ensure that a Health IT Module presented for
certification to any of the certification  
criteria that fall into each regulatory text “first level paragraph”
category of § 170.315 (e.g. § 170.315(a))  
identified in the table above is certified to either Approach 1
(technically demonstrate) or Approach 2  
(system documentation). In addition, we propose that health IT
developers seeking certification to any §  
170.315 certification criterion for their Health IT Modules attest to
whether they encrypt authentication  
credentials (§ 170.315(d)(12)) and support multi-factor authentication
(§ 170.315(d)(13)).  
  
We clarify that of the adopted 2015 Edition certification criteria, only
the privacy and security criteria  
specified in § 170.315(g)(1) through (6) are exempt from the 2015
Edition privacy and security  
certification framework due to the capabilities included in these
criteria, which do not implicate privacy  
and security concerns.  
  
In order to be issued a certification, a Health IT Module would only
need to be tested once to each  
applicable privacy and security criterion identified as part of Approach
1 or Approach 2 so long as the  
health IT developer attests that such privacy and security capabilities
apply to the full scope of  
capabilities included in the requested certification, except for the
certification of a Health IT Module to §  
170.315(e)(1) “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” and (e)(2)
“secure messaging.” For each of  
these criteria, a Health IT Module must be separately tested to §
170.315(d)(9) because of the specific  
capabilities for secure electronic transmission and secure electronic
messaging included in each criterion,  
respectively. We also propose the health IT developers seeking
certification to any § 170.315  
certification criterion for their Health IT Modules attest to whether
they encrypt authentication  
credentials (§ 170.315(d)(12)) and support multi-factor authentication
(§ 170.315(d)(13)).  
\* § 170.315(d)(2)(i)(C) is not required if the scope of the Health IT
Module does not have end-user  
device encryption features.

*B. Principles of Proper Conduct for ONC-ACBs*  
**  
1\. Records Retention  
We propose to revise the records retention requirement in § 170.523(g)
to include the  
“life of the edition” as well as 3 years after the retirement of an
edition related to the certification  
of Complete EHRs and Health IT Module(s). In the 2015 Edition final rule
(80 FR 62602), we  
adopted a records retention provision that required ONC–ACBs to retain
all records related to the  
certification of Complete EHRs and Health IT Module(s) for the ‘‘life of
the edition’’ plus an  
additional 3 years, and the records would be available to HHS upon
request during this period of  
time. In the 2015 Edition final rule, the ‘‘life of the edition’’ was
defined as beginning with the  
codification of an edition of certification criteria in regulation and
ending when the edition is  
removed from regulation. We now propose to clarify that HHS has the
ability to access  
certification records for the “life of the edition,” which begins with
the codification of an edition  
of certification criteria in the Code of Federal Regulations through a
minimum of 3 years from  
the effective date that removes the applicable edition from the Code of
Federal Regulations, not  
solely during the 3-year period after removal from the CFR.  
2\. Conformance Methods for Certification Criteria  
The Principle of Proper Conduct (PoPC) in § 170.523(h) specifies that
ONC-ACBs may  
only certify health IT that has been tested by ONC-ATLs using tools and
test procedures  
approved by the National Coordinator. We propose to revise this PoPC in
three ways. First, we  
propose to revise this PoPC to additionally permit ONC-ACBs to certify
Health IT Modules that  
they have evaluated for conformance with certification criteria without
first passing through an  
ONC-ATL. However, we propose that such methods to determine conformity
must first be

-----

<span id="123"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **123** of **724**  
  
approved by the National Coordinator. This proposal provides valuable
Program flexibility and  
market efficiencies for streamlining Health IT Module certification,
acknowledging the broad  
spectrum of evidence of conformance, from laboratory testing with an
ONC-ATL to developer  
self-declaration. This Program flexibility will also allow us to
leverage the success we have seen  
in implementation of our alternative test method process where any
entity can submit a test  
procedure and/or test tool for approval for use under the Program. For
example, the National  
Coordinator may, under this provision, approve a conformance method for
certification criteria  
where evidence of a valid declaration of conformity (e.g.,
certification) granted under an external  
program can be submitted directly to an ONC-ACB to meet the requirement
of that certification  
criteria.  
Second, we propose to revise the PoPC to clarify that certifications can
only be issued to  
Health IT Modules and not Complete EHRs. We are proposing to remove the
2014 Edition from  
the CFR (*see* section II.B.2 of this preamble) and Complete EHR
certifications are no longer  
available for certification to the 2015 Edition (80 FR 62608; 79 FR
54443). We propose to  
remove the provision that permits the use of test results from National
Voluntary Laboratory  
Accreditation Program (NVLAP)-accredited testing laboratories under the
Program because the  
regulatory transition period from NVLAP-accredited testing laboratories
to ONC-ATLs has  
expired (81 FR 72447).  
Third, we propose to remove the provision that permits the certification
of health IT  
previously certified to an edition if the certification criterion or
criteria to which the Health IT  
Module(s) was previously certified have not been revised and no new
certification criteria are  
applicable because the circumstances that this provision seeks to
address are no longer feasible

**NOTICE**  
**** This HHS-approved document has been submitted to the Office of the
Federal Register (OFR) for publication and  
has not yet been placed on public display or published in the Federal

<span id="124"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **124** of **724**  
  
with certification to the 2015 Edition. Any Health IT Module previously
certified to the 2014  
Edition and presented for certification to the 2015 Edition would have
at least one new or revised  
2015 Edition certification criteria that would be applicable. For
example, the 2015 Edition  
“accessibility-centered design” criterion (§ 170.315(g)(5)) is
applicable to any Health IT Module  
presented for certification to the 2015 Edition.  
3\. ONC-ACBs to Accept Test Results from Any ONC-ATL in Good Standing  
We propose to revise the PoPC for ONC-ACBs in order to address business
relationships  
between ONC-ACBs and ONC-ATLs. To encourage market competition, we
propose to require  
ONC-ACBs to accept test results from any ONC-ATL that is in good
standing under the  
Program and is compliant with its ISO 17025 accreditation requirements.
However, if an ONC-  
ACB has concerns about accepting test results from a certain ONC-ATL,
the ONC-ACB would  
have an opportunity to explain the potential issues to ONC and NVLAP,
and on a case-by-case  
basis, ONC could consider the facts and make the final determination.  
ONC-ATLs must be accredited by the NVLAP and seek authorization from ONC
to  
participate in the ONC Health IT Certification Program. ONC-ATLs test
products against the  
ONC-approved test method for the standards and certification criteria
identified by the Secretary  
using ONC-approved test methods. ONC-ACBs make certification
determinations and conduct  
surveillance for health IT originally tested by an ONC-ATL. Based on the
process that all ONC-  
ATLs must undergo, we believe that they are capable of providing
accurate test results that  
should be accepted by any ONC-ACB.  
The intent of this proposal is to ensure that ONC-ATLs are not
discriminated against and  
do not suffer injury from ONC-ACBs not accepting their test results if,
in fact, they are in good

standing. This proposal may also prevent harm to health IT developers,
who present their health  
IT to be tested by ONC-ATLs and ultimately seek certification by
ONC-ACBs under the  
Program. These situations may arise if a health IT developer’s ONC-ACB
leaves the Program or  
goes out of business. This proposal may also prevent situations of
preferential business  
arrangements such as when one organization is both an ONC-ATL and
ONC-ACB and will not  
enter into a contract with another organization who is also an
ONC-ATL.  
4\. Mandatory Disclosures and Certifications  
We propose to revise the PoPC in § 170.523(k). We propose to remove §
170.523(k)  
(1)(ii)(B) because certifications can only be issued to Health IT
Modules and not Complete  
EHRs. We are proposing to remove the 2014 Edition from the CFR (*see*
section III.B.2 of this  
preamble) and Complete EHR certifications are no longer available for
certification to the 2015  
Edition (80 FR 62608; 79 FR 54443). We also propose to revise §
170.523(k)(1)(iii) to broaden  
the section beyond just the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs
(now referred to as  
Promoting Interoperability Programs). We propose to revise the section
to include a detailed  
description of all known material information concerning additional
types of costs or fees that a  
user may be required to pay to implement or use the Health IT Module's
capabilities, whether to  
meet provisions of HHS programs requiring the use of certified health IT
or to achieve any other  
use within the scope of the health IT’s certification.  
We also propose to remove the provision in § 170.523(k)(3) that requires
a certification  
issued to a pre-coordinated, integrated bundle of Health IT Modules to
be treated the same as a  
certification issued to a Complete EHR for the purposes of §
170.523(k)(1), except that the  
certification must also indicate each Health IT Module that is included
in the bundle. We propose

-----

<span id="126"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **126** of **724**  
  
to remove this provision because pre-coordinated, integrated bundles are
no longer applicable for  
certification under Program.  
We propose to revise § 170.523(k)(4) to clarify that a certification
issued to a Health IT  
Module based solely on the applicable certification criteria adopted by
the ONC Health IT  
Certification Program must be separate and distinct from any other
certification(s) based on other  
criteria or requirements. The intent of this provision, as indicated in
the Establishment of the  
Permanent Certification Program for Health Information Technology final
rule (76 FR 1272), is  
to ensure that any other certifications an ONC-ACB may issue, is
separately indicated from the  
applicable certification criteria adopted by the ONC Health IT
Certification Program.  
We also propose changes related to transparency attestations and
limitations in section  
III.B.5. of this preamble. Additionally, we propose other new PoPCs for
ONC-ACBs in sections  
VII.B.5 and VII.D of this preamble.  
*C. Principles of Proper Conduct for ONC-ATLs – Records Retention*  
**  
We propose to revise the records retention requirement in § 170.524(f)
to include the “life  
of the edition” as well as 3 years after the retirement of an edition
related to the certification of  
Health IT Module(s). The circumstances are the same as in section V.B.1
of this preamble  
mentioned above, therefore, we propose the same revisions for ONC-ATLs
as we did for ONC-  
ACBs.  
**VI. Health IT for the Care Continuum**  
  
ONC believes health IT should help promote and support patient care when
and where it  
is needed. This means health IT should help support patient populations,
specialized care,  
transitions of care, and practice settings across the care continuum. In
the Permanent

<span id="127"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **127** of **724**  
  
Certification Program final rule, we clarified that section 3001(c)(5)
of the PHSA provides the  
National Coordinator with the authority to establish a voluntary
certification program or  
programs for other types of health IT beyond those which supported the
EHR Incentive  
Programs (now called the Promoting Interoperability Programs). However,
we decided that the  
initial focus of the Program should be on supporting the EHR Incentive
Programs, which focuses  
on EHR technology for the ambulatory and inpatient settings (76 FR
1294). As the Program  
evolved and the adoption and use of certified health IT increased
significantly, we modified the  
Program in the 2015 Edition final rule to make it more open and
accessible to more types of  
health IT, including health IT that supports various care and practice
settings beyond those  
included in the EHR Incentive Programs (80 FR 62604). Our goal was then
and is now to  
support the advancement of interoperable health IT and to promote health
IT functionality in care  
and practice settings across the care continuum (*see also* 80 FR
62604).  
  
ONC’s efforts in the 2015 Edition to make the Program more open and
accessible to  
other care settings also aligned with fall 2013 recommendations from the
HIT Policy Committee  
(HITPC). The HITPC examined the extension of the Program to include
functionalities that  
would benefit settings not covered by the EHR Incentive Programs. The
HITPC recommended  
that considerations regarding functionality should focus on whether the
functionality would:  
• Advance a national priority or legislative mandate  
• Align with existing federal/state programs  
• Utilize the existing technology pipeline  
• Build on existing stakeholder support  
• Appropriately balance the costs and benefits of a certification
program.

HHS-approved document.  

-----

<span id="128"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **128** of **724**  
  
Taking into consideration the HITPC recommendations, ONC’s 2015 Edition
focused on  
the adoption of certification criteria that are standards-based,
applicable to a wide variety of care  
and practice settings, and that advance the structured recording,
access, exchange, and use of  
health information. ONC has also encouraged users – including specialty
groups – to continue to  
work with developers to innovate, develop, and deploy health IT in
specific clinical settings in  
ways that promote safety, effectiveness, and efficient health care
delivery while also reducing  
burden.  
In the 2015 Edition final rule we stated that we did not intend to **
develop and issue  
separate regulatory certification “paths” or “tracks” for particular
care or practice settings (*e.g.*, a  
“long-term and post-acute care (LTPAC) certification”) because it would
be difficult to  
*independently* construct such “paths” or “tracks” in a manner that
would align with other relevant  
programs and specific stakeholder needs. While we never have had
intentions to adopt care- or  
practice-specific certification tracks, or additional voluntary
program(s), in parallel to the  
existing voluntary ONC Health IT Certification Program, we stated that
we would welcome the  
opportunity to work with HHS agencies, other agencies, and provider
associations in identifying  
the appropriate functionality and certification criteria in the Program
to support their  
stakeholders (80 FR 62704). This approach is consistent with the
recommendations by the  
HITPC.  
Since the publication of the 2015 Edition final rule, ONC has explored
how we might  
work with the industry and with specialty organizations to
collaboratively advance health IT that  
supports medical specialties and sites of service. As a result, we have
gained insight from  
stakeholders regarding the burdens associated with establishing a
specific set of required

certification criteria for all users—which may include capabilities not
applicable to certain  
settings of care or specialties. Stakeholders have also noted that the
adoption of a set of required  
criteria without also enabling and incentivizing innovation beyond those
criteria may have the  
unintended consequence of stifling progress for that setting.
Stakeholders noted that the timeline  
for testing and certifying to required criteria and the subsequent
deployment of certification  
criteria in practice settings is not always aligned with standards
updates, the emergence of new  
standards, or technological innovation. Finally, stakeholders have urged
ONC to leverage  
multiple means to advance interoperability standards that are widely
applicable, to enable and  
promote innovation that is supported by these standards, and – in
collaboration with stakeholders  
– to monitor and support developments in emerging standards and
technologies for specialty use  
cases.  
Section 4001(b)(i) of the Cures Act instructs the National Coordinator
to encourage, keep, or  
recognize, through existing authorities, the voluntary certification of
health IT under the Program  
for use in medical specialties and sites of service for which no such
technology is available or  
where more technological advancement or integration is needed. This
provision of the Cures Act  
closely aligns with ONC’s ongoing collaborative efforts with both
federal partners and  
stakeholders within the health care and health IT community to encourage
and support the  
advancement of health IT for a wide range of clinical settings. These
initiatives have included  
projects related to clinical priorities beyond those specifically
included in the EHR Incentive  
Programs (now called the Promoting Interoperability Programs) including

the specific implementation goal and align with the technical
specifications already available in  
the Program for certification. To advance these efforts, we generally
consider a range of factors  
including: stakeholder input and identification of clinical needs and
clinical priorities, the  
evolution and adoption of health IT across the care continuum, the costs
and benefits associated  
with any policy or implementation strategy related to care settings and
sites of service, and  
potential regulatory burden and compliance timelines. Generally, ONC’s
approach can be  
summarized in three parts:  
• First, ONC analyzes existing certification criteria to identify how
such criteria may be  
applicable for medical specialties and sites of service.  
• Second, ONC focuses on the real-time evaluation of existing and
emerging standards to  
determine applicability to medical specialties and sites of service as
well as to the broader  
care continuum, including the evaluation of such standards for inclusion
in the ONC  
Interoperability Standards Advisory (ISA).[41](ONCs.html#130)  
• Third, ONC may work in collaboration with stakeholders to support the
development of  
informational resources for medical specialties and sites of service for
which ONC identifies  
a need to advance the effective implementation of certified health IT.  
We believe this approach provides an economical, flexible, and
responsive option for  
both health care providers and the health IT industry, which is also in
alignment with the  
provisions of the Cures Act related to burden reduction and promoting
interoperability. We are  
committed to continuing to work with stakeholders in this manner to
encourage and advance the  
adoption of health IT to support medical specialties and sites of
service, and to help ensure that

providers have the tools they need to support patients at the point of
care and that essential  
patient health information is available across a care settings.  
This section outlines our approach to implement Section 4001(b) of the
Cures Act, which  
requires that the Secretary make recommendations for the voluntary
certification of health IT for  
use by pediatric health providers and to adopt certification criteria to
support the voluntary  
certification of health IT for use by pediatric health providers to
support the health care of  
children. To be clear, and consistent with past practice, we do not
recommend or propose a  
“pediatric-specific track or program” under the ONC Health IT
Certification Program. This  
proposed rule outlines the certification criteria adopted in the 2015
Edition which we believe  
support the certification of health IT for pediatric care. Finally, it
identifies the new and revised  
criteria proposed in this rule which we believe further support the
voluntary certification of  
health IT for pediatric care. We have included in the appendix of this
proposed rule a set of  
technical worksheets that can help inform your comments on the
recommendations, the new and  
revised criteria in the Program that would also support pediatric care
settings, and the overall  
approach we have herein described. These worksheets outline the
following information:  
• The alignment of each recommendation to the Children’s Model EHR
Format[42](ONCs.html#131) as identified  
by stakeholders (see also Section VI.A.1 and 2 for further detail on the
Children’s Model  
EHR Format and the recommendations).  
• The alignment of each recommendation to the 2015 Edition certification
criteria and new or  
revised criteria described in this proposed rule (see also section

We invite readers to use these worksheets to inform public comment on  
the recommendations and criteria described in Section VI.A.2
specifically as they  
relate to pediatric health care use cases. The comments received on
these  
technical worksheets through this proposed rule will be used to inform
the final  
recommendations for voluntary certification of health IT criteria for
use in  
pediatric care. . Furthermore, these comments, and the detailed insights
received  
through stakeholder outreach, may inform the future development of a
non-  
binding informational guide or resource to provide useful information
for health  
IT developers and pediatric care providers seeking to successfully
implement  
these health IT solutions in a clinical setting.  
  
*A. Health IT for Pediatric Setting*  
Section 4001(b)(iii) of the Cures Act – “Health information technology
for pediatrics”  
requires that:  
• First, that the Secretary, in consultation with relevant stakeholders,
shall make  
recommendations for the voluntary certification of health IT for use by
pediatric health  
providers to support the health care of children, and  
• Second, that the Secretary shall adopt certification criteria to
support the voluntary  
certification of health IT for use by pediatric health providers to
support the health care of  
children.  
In this proposed rule, we describe our approach to stakeholder
engagement, the analysis  
used to develop the recommendations, and the specific certification
criteria we believe can  
support each recommendation.

effective health IT tools and resources for pediatric care. These have
included a number of  
public-private partnerships including efforts between HHS, state
agencies, and health systems for  
innovative projects that range from care coordination enterprise
solutions to immunization  
information systems and to point of care solutions for specialty needs.
In order to learn from and  
build upon these efforts, ONC has engaged with stakeholders in both the
public and private  
sector including other federal, state and local government partners,
health care providers engaged  
in the care of children, standards development organizations, charitable
foundations engaged in  
children’s health care research, and health IT developers supporting
pediatric care settings.  
For example, significant work has been done by the Agency for Healthcare
Research and  
Quality (AHRQ), CMS, the Health Resources and Services Administration
(HRSA), and  
organizations around the Children’s Model EHR Format (Children’s
Format), which is critical to  
any discussion of the pediatric health IT
landscape.[43](ONCs.html#133)The Children’s Format was authorized by  
the 2009 Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act
(CHIPRA)[44](ONCs.html#133)and developed  
by AHRQ in close collaboration with CMS. It was developed to bridge the
gap between the  
functionality present in most EHRs currently available and the
functionality that could optimally  
support the care of children. Specifically, the Children’s Format
provides information to EHR  
system developers and others about critical functionality and other
requirements that are helpful  
to include in an EHR system to address health care needs specific to the
care of children. The  
final version of the Children’s Format,[45](ONCs.html#133)released in
2015, consists of 47 high priority functional

requirements in 19 topic areas that focus on improvements that would
better support the safety  
and quality of care delivered to children. The Children’s Format was
intended as a starting point  
for developers, users, and purchasers for informing an approach for
pediatric voluntary  
certification. We refer to the Voluntary Edition proposed rule for a
description of ONC’s prior  
discussion around the Children’s Format (79 FR 10930).  
In the summer of 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) reviewed
the 2015  
Format using a robust analytical process and engagement with their
members. The result was a  
prioritized list of eight clinical priorities to support pediatric
health care (“Priority List”). In  
October 2017, ONC held a technical discussion with stakeholders titled
“Health IT for  
Pediatrics” with the specific purpose of obtaining input from an array
of stakeholders in an effort  
to draw correlations between the pediatric providers’ clinical
priorities identified in the Priority  
List with the detailed technical requirements outlined in the Children’s
Format and the  
capabilities and standards that could be included in certified health
IT. Through this collaborative  
approach, the meeting participants identified a set of priority needs
for health IT to support  
pediatric care based upon those identified by the Priority List and the
primary correlation to the  
Children’s Format.  
2\. Recommendations for the Voluntary Certification of Health IT for use
in Pediatric  
Care  
To support the first part of Section 4001(b) of the Cures Act, ONC
considered the  
historical efforts on the Children’s Model EHR Format, the input from
stakeholders, and our own  
technical analysis and review of health IT capabilities and standards to
develop a set of

recommendations for voluntary certification for health IT for pediatric
care. These include eight  
recommendations related to the Priority List:  
• Recommendation 1: Use biometric-specific norms for growth curves and
support growth  
charts for children  
• Recommendation 2: Compute weight-based drug dosage  
• Recommendation 3: Ability to document all guardians and caregivers  
• Recommendation 4: Segmented access to information  
• Recommendation 5: Synchronize immunization histories with registries  
• Recommendation 6: Age- and weight- specific single-dose range
checking  
• Recommendation 7: Transferrable access authority  
• Recommendation 8: Associate maternal health information and
demographics with newborn  
We also developed two additional recommendations beyond the Priority
List which relate  
to other items within the Children’s Format that are considered
important to pediatric  
stakeholders. These additional recommendations, which we believe may be
supported by  
certified health IT, are as follows:  
• Recommendation 9: Track incomplete preventative care opportunities  
• Recommendation 10: Flag special health care needs  
In order to implement the second part of Section 4001(b) of the Cures
Act for the  
adoption of certification criteria to support the voluntary
certification of health IT for use by  
pediatric health care providers, we have identified both the 2015
Edition certification criteria and  
the new or revised criteria in this proposed rule that we believe
support these 10  
recommendations for health IT for pediatric care and sites of service.

the  
recommendations, the inclusion of specific items from the Children’s
Format, and the identified  
certification criteria as they relate specifically to use cases for
pediatric care and sites of service.  
We also seek comment on the following:

available best  
practices, activities, and tools) that may impact or support feasibility
of the  
recommendation in practice.  
2\. Effective use of health IT itself in support of each recommendation
as involves provider  
training, establishing workflow, and other related safety and usability
considerations.

a. 2015 Edition Certification Criteria  
In order to implement the second part of Section 4001(b) of the Cures
Act to adopt  
certification criteria to support the voluntary certification of health
IT for use by pediatric health  
providers to support the health care of children, we identified the
following 2015 Edition  
certification criteria that support the recommendations. Within the
technical worksheets in the  
appendix of this proposed rule, these criteria are noted under each
recommendation to which  
they are correlated. The 2015 Edition criteria are as follows:  
• “API functionality” criteria (§ 170.315(g)(7)-(g)(9)) which addresses
many of the  
challenges currently faced by patients and by caregivers such as parents
or guardians  
accessing child’s health information, including the “multiple portal”
problem, by  
potentially allowing individuals to aggregate health information from
multiple sources in  
a web or mobile application of their choice.  
• “Care plan” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(9)) which supports pediatric care
by facilitating the  
documentation of electronic health information in a structured format to
improve care  
coordination (80 FR 62648-62649).  
• “Clinical decision support” (CDS) criterion (§ 170.315(a)(9)) which
supports pediatric  
care by enabling interventions based on the capture of biometric data.

<span id="138"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **138** of **724**  
  
• “Common Clinical Data Set” (adopted in (§170.315(b)(4) and
§170.315(b)(5)) which  
includes *optional* pediatric vital sign data elements including as
optional the reference  
range/growth curve for three pediatric vital signs--BMI percent per
LOINC identifiers for  
age per sex, weight per length/sex, and head occipital-frontal
circumference for children  
less than three years of age.  
• “Data segmentation for privacy” send criterion and receive criterion
(adopted in  
§170.315(b)(7) and §170.315(b)(8)) which provides the ability to: create
a summary  
record that is tagged at the document level as restricted and subject to
re-disclosure;  
receive a summary record that is document-level tagged as restricted;
separate the  
document-level tagged document from other documents received; and, view
the restricted  
document without having to incorporate any of the data from the
document.  
• “Demographics” criterion (§ 170.315(a)(5)) which supports pediatric
care through the  
capture of values and value sets relevant for the pediatric health care
setting as well as  
allowing for improved patient matching which is a key challenge for
pediatric care.  
•
[“Electronic](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/2015Ed_CCG_b3-E-prescribing.pdf)Prescribing”
criterion (adopted in §170.315(b)(3)) which includes an *optional*  
Structured and Codified Sig Format, which has the capability to exchange
weight-based  
dosing calculations within the NCPDP SCRIPT 10.6 standard and limits the
ability to  
prescribe all oral, liquid medications in only metric standard units of
mL (i.e., not cc)  
important for enabling safe prescribing practices for children.  
• “Family health history” criterion (§ 170.315(a)(12)) which supports
pediatric care  
because it leverages concepts or expressions for familial conditions,
which are especially  
clinically relevant when caring for children.

• “Patient health information capture” criterion (§ 170.315(e)(3)) which
supports  
providers’ ability to accept health information from a patient or
authorized representative.  
This criterion could support pediatric care through documentation of
decision-making  
authority of a patient representative.  
• “Social, psychological, and behavioral data’’ criterion §
170.315(a)(15) which supports  
integration of behavioral health data into a child’s record across the
care continuum by  
enabling a user to record, change, and access a patient’s social,
psychological, and  
behavioral data based using SNOMED CT® and LOINC® codes.  
• “Transitions of care” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)) which supports
structured transition of  
care summaries and referral summaries that help ensure the coordination
and continuity  
of health care as children transfer between different clinicians at
different health care  
organizations or different levels of care within the same health care
organization;  
• “Transmission to immunization registries” criterion (§ 170.315(f)(1))
which supports the  
safe and effective provision of child health care through immunizations
and registry  
linkages. This criterion also provides the ability to request, access,
and display the  
evaluated immunization history and forecast from an immunization
registry for a patient.  
Immunization forecasting recommendations allow for providers to access
the most  
complete and up-to-date information on a patient's immunization history
to inform  
discussions about what vaccines a patient may need based on nationally
recommended  
immunization recommendations (80 FR 62662-62664).

the ability for patients (and their authorized
representatives)[47](ONCs.html#140) to view, download, and  
transmit their health information to a 3rd party.  
We note that some of these criteria may be updated based on proposals
contained in this  
proposed rule; however, we believe that prior to any such updates,
technology that is currently  
available and certified to these 2015 Edition criteria can make a
significant impact in supporting  
providers engaged in the health care of children. We invite readers to
use the technical  
worksheets in the appendix to this proposed rule to inform their public
comment on the  
recommendations, the inclusion of specific items from the Children’s
Format, and the identified  
2015 Edition certification criteria as they relate specifically to use
cases for pediatric care and  
sites of service.  
b. New or Revised Certification Criteria in this Proposed Rule  
In order to implement the second part of Section 4001(b)(iii) of the
Cures Act to adopt  
certification criteria to support the voluntary certification of health
information technology for  
use by pediatric health providers to support the health care of
children, we identified new or  
revised certification criteria in this proposed rule that support the
recommendations. These new  
or revised criteria and standards in this proposed rule that would
support pediatric settings  
include:  
  
47 The VDT criterion includes a “patient-authorized representative”
concept that aligns with the use of the term  
under the EHR Incentive Program. A “patient-authorized representative”
is defined as any individual to whom the  
patient has granted access to their health information (see also[77
FR 13720)](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/77-FR-13720).
However, consent is not needed for  
minors, for whom existing local, state, or federal law grants their
parents or guardians access (see also[77 FR  
13720).](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/77-FR-13720)

• New API criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)) which would serve to implement
the Cures Act  
requirement to permit health information to be accessed, exchanged, and
used from APIs  
without special effort (see section IV.B.5 of this proposed rule)  
• New “DS4P” criteria (two for C-CDA ((§ 170.315(b)(12)) and (§
170.315(b)(13)) and one  
for FHIR (§ 170.315(g)(11))) that would support a more granular approach
to privacy  
tagging data for health information exchange supported by either the
C-CDA- or FHIR-based  
exchange standards (see section VI.A for a discussion of this criteria
in relation to pediatric  
settings and section VI.B for discussion of these criteria in relation
to Opioid Use Disorder)  
• New electronic prescribing certification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(11)),
which would supports  
improved patient safety and prescription accuracy, workflow
efficiencies, and increased  
configurability of systems including functionality that could support
pediatric medication  
management.  
• USCDI (§ 170.213) which enables the inclusion of pediatric vital sign
data elements,  
including the reference range/scale or growth curve for BMI percentile
per age and sex,  
weight for age per length and sex, and head occipital-frontal
circumference (and the criteria  
that include the USCDI)  
Each of these proposed criteria are further described in other sections
of this proposed rule;  
however, in this section of this proposed rule we specifically seek
comment on the application of  
these criteria to pediatric use cases in support of our recommendations
for the voluntary  
certification of health IT for pediatric care.  
For example, our proposal for three new 2015 Edition DS4P certification
criteria (two for  
C-CDA ((§ 170.315(b)(12)) and (§ 170.315(b)(13)) and one for FHIR (§

recommendations. Specifically,  
stakeholders have expressed the need to—based on the intended recipient
of the data—to restrict  
granular pediatric health data at production. We believe these criteria
could, for example, help  
enable providers to:  
• Limit the sharing of reproductive and sexual health data from an EHR
in order to protect the  
minor’s privacy;  
• Prevent disclosure of an emancipated minor’s sensitive health
information, while also  
permitting a parent or legal guardian to provide consent for treatment;
and  
• Segment child abuse information based on jurisdictional laws, which
may have varying  
information sharing requirements for parents, guardians, and/or other
possible legal  
representatives.  
While health care providers should already have processes and workflows
in place to  
address their existing compliance obligations, we recognize that more
granular privacy markings  
at the point of data capture would further support existing and future
priorities of pediatric health  
providers, as well as for multiple medical specialties and sites of
service. We also recognize that  
such point of data capture markings can reduce administrative burden
through efficiencies gained  
in streamlined compliance workflows.  
We invite readers to use the technical worksheets in the appendix of
this proposed rule to

Children’s Format, and the identified proposed new or revised
certification criteria as they relate  
specifically to use cases for pediatric care and sites of service.  
However, as discussed, through our experience and engagement with health
care  
providers and health IT developers, we believe that in some cases
information resources can aid  
in implementation in clinical settings. In the past, ONC has worked
collaboratively with federal  
partners, health IT developers, and the health care community to support
the development of  
non-regulatory informational resources that can provide additional
support for health IT  
implementation (see, for example, the ONC Patient Engagement Playbook).
Such a resource  
could include the recommendations and certification criteria here
identified and synthesize these  
technical recommendations with information outside of the Program
related to patient safety,  
usability, privacy and security, and other key considerations for
successful implementation of a  
health IT system within a clinical setting. We believe that the creation
of such a resource, in  
collaboration with clinical and technical stakeholders, would help
support the advancement of  
health IT solutions for use in pediatric care and pediatric settings. We
further include additional  
information on prior ONC initiatives related to health IT for pediatric
settings as available on our

*B. Health IT and Opioid Use Disorder Prevention and Treatment – Request
for Information*  
**  
We have identified a need to explore ways to advance health IT across
the care  
continuum to support efforts to fight the opioid epidemic. To that
purpose, we seek comment in  
this proposed rule on a series of questions related to health IT
functionalities and standards to  
support the effective prevention and treatment of opioid use disorder
(OUD) across patient  
populations and care settings.

We recognize the significance of the opioid epidemic confronting our
nation and the  
importance of helping to support health care providers committed to
preventing inappropriate  
access to prescription opioids and providing safe, appropriate
treatment.  
HHS has a comprehensive strategy to combat the opioid crisis. It
consists of five points  
that are focused on better: addiction prevention, treatment, and
recovery services; data; pain  
management; targeting of overdose reversing drugs; and
research.[48](ONCs.html#144)In support of this strategy,  
HHS will improve access to prevention, treatment, and recovery support
services; target the  
availability and distribution of overdose-reversing drugs; strengthen
public health data reporting  
and collection; support cutting-edge research; and advance the practice
of pain management. To  
combat the opioid crisis, in October 2018, Congress passed the Substance
Use-Disorder  
Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for
Patients and  
Communities Act. It aims to expand treatment, recovery, and prevention
initiatives for substance  
use disorder and also includes interoperability and health IT tools as a
key part of the response to  
this crisis.  
We believe health IT offers promising strategies to help medical
specialties and sites of  
service as they combat opioid use disorder (OUD). For example, health IT
has the potential to  
improve adherence to opioid prescribing guidelines and physician
adherence to treatment  
protocols, to increase the safety of prescribing for controlled
substances, to enhance clinician  
access to PDMPs, and to expand access to addiction treatment and
recovery support services.  
Additionally, through the Program, our goal continues to be to improve
access to data from  
disparate sources and help ensure that key data is consistently
available to the right person, at the

right place, and at the right time across the care continuum. One
component of advancing that  
goal is through technical standards for exchanging health information
that form an essential  
foundation for interoperability.  
ONC has heard from stakeholders including policymakers, implementers,
health care  
providers and patient advocacy groups that additional information is
needed to assist in planning  
for the effective use of health IT in OUD prevention and treatment. We
additionally recognize  
stakeholders’ interest in the new opioid measures (Query of PDMP measure
and Verify Opioid  
Treatment Agreement measure) included in CMS’s Promoting
Interoperability Programs  
(formerly known as the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs).
These two measures  
support HHS initiatives related to the treatment of opioid and substance
use disorders by helping  
health care providers avoid inappropriate prescriptions, improve
coordination of prescribing  
amongst health care providers, and focus on the advanced use of
certified health IT in care  
coordination for OUD prevention and treatment (83 FR 41644).  
In order to support these efforts, in this proposed rule we outline a
brief overview of  
some key areas of health IT implementation that could support OUD
prevention and treatment.  
These include consideration of current health IT certification criteria
included in the 2015  
Edition, revised or new certification criteria as outlined in this
proposed rule, and current health  
IT initiatives underway in the health care industry or health IT
industry which intersect with  
ONC policy goals. In this section of the proposed rule, we request
public comment specifically  
from the perspective of how our existing Program requirements and
proposals in this rulemaking  
may support use cases related to OUD prevention and treatment and if
there are additional areas  
that ONC should consider for effective implementation of health
IT-enabled OUD prevention

identification of 2015 Edition  
certification criteria, the proposals for revised or new certification
criteria, and the potential  
future consideration of emerging technologies described in various
initiatives.  
  
1\. 2015 Edition Certification Criteria  
We seek public comment on how the existing 2015 Edition certification
criteria as well as  
proposals within this proposed rule for revised or new criteria support
OUD prevention and  
treatment. Specifically, we seek comment on certification criteria
previously adopted in the 2015  
Edition that can support clinical priorities, advance interoperability
for OUD (including care  
coordination and the effective use of health IT for the treatment and
prevention of OUD). In this  
proposed rule, we summarize some of these 2015 Edition certification
criteria identified and  
indicate how they support care coordination, the prevention of OUD and
overdose, and the  
detection of opioid misuse, abuse, and diversion.  
We have also below identified the proposals for revised or new 2015
Edition criteria  
within this proposed rule that we believe can support clinical
priorities, advance interoperability  
for OUD (including care coordination and also the effective use of
health IT for the treatment  
and prevention of OUD). We welcome input from stakeholders specifically
on these criteria  
within the context of OUD prevention and treatment, as well as input on
the identification of  
other criteria included either in the 2015 Edition and/or that are
proposed in other parts of this  
rule that may be considered a clinical and interoperability priority for
supporting OUD treatment  
and prevention.

<span id="147"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **147** of **724**  
  
We have identified several 2015 Edition certification criteria available
now for  
certification in the Program which could support care coordination and
the prevention and  
detection of opioid misuse, abuse, and diversion. They are:  
• The “transitions of care” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)) supports
structured transition of care  
summaries and referral summaries that help ensure the coordination and
continuity of health  
care as patients transfer between different clinicians at different
health care organizations or  
different levels of care within the same health care organization. This
criteria supports the  
ability to transmit a summary care record to support an individual with
OUD upon discharge  
from an inpatient setting or from a primary care provider to another
setting for their care.  
• The “clinical information reconciliation and incorporation” criterion
(§ 170.315(b)(2)) allows  
clinicians to reconcile and incorporate patient health information sent
from external sources  
to maintain a more accurate and up-to-date patient record. This process
could help—for  
example—reduce opioid related errors regarding patients who use multiple
pharmacies, have  
co-morbidity factors, and visit multiple clinicians.  
• The “electronic prescribing” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(3)) provides a
way to write and transmit  
prescription information electronically. This criterion facilitates
appropriate opioid  
prescribing by simplifying the review of prescription information during
follow-up visits or  
transitions to other clinicians, by allowing prescribers to communicate
prescription-related  
messages to pharmacies electronically and by capturing and transmitting
medication histories  
that are shared with PDMPs. In this proposed rule, we propose to update
the existing  
electronic prescribing certification criterion as described in section
IV.B.2 of this proposed  
rule.

<span id="148"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **148** of **724**  
  
• The “patient health information capture” (§ 170.315(e)(3)) allows
clinicians to incorporate  
unstructured patient generated health data or data from a non-clinical
setting into a patient  
record. The CMS Promoting Interoperability Programs for eligible
hospitals includes a new  
optional measure which is focused on verifying the existence of a signed
Opioid Treatment  
Agreement for certain patients when a controlled substance is prescribed
and incorporating it  
into the record. In the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems
final rule, CMS  
recognized this certification criterion’s potential to support this goal
within a certified health  
IT system (83 FR 41654).  
• The “social, psychological, and behavioral data” criterion
(§170.315(a)(15)) can help to  
provide a more complete view of a patient’s overall health status. This
is important to help  
provide a “whole-patient” approach to the treatment of substance use
disorders included as  
part of Medicated-Assisted Treatment (MAT) that involves the use of
FDA-approved  
medications, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to
treat individuals  
recovering from OUD. This data can help to improve care coordination and
lead to the  
identification of appropriate social supports and community resources.  
We seek comment on how these criteria and what additional 2015 Edition
certification  
criteria may be considered a clinical and interoperability priority for
supporting OUD treatment  
and prevention. We also seek comment on the value of developing a
potential future non-  
binding informational guide or resource to provide useful information
for OUD providers and  
sites of service related to specific clinical priorities and use cases
of focus.

<span id="149"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **149** of **724**  
  
This proposed rule contains additional proposals to revise or add new
criteria to the  
Program to better support care across the continuum. We believe these
criteria and standards,  
highlighted below, can also support treatment and prevention of OUD. We
seek comment  
specifically on the applicability of these criteria to the OUD use case.
They are:  
• **USCDI:** As detailed in section IV.B.1, we are proposing to adopt
the USCDI as a standard (§  
170.213) which would establish a minimum set of data classes (including
structured data  
fields) that are required to be interoperable nationwide, and is
designed to be expanded in an  
iterative and predictable way over time. The USCDI Version 1 (USCDI v1)
builds upon the  
2015 Edition CCDS and includes a common set of data classes that can be
supported by  
commonly used standards. It includes the 2015 Edition CCDS data
elements, such as  
medications. It also includes two new data classes, titled “clinical
notes” and “provenance,”  
which would help facilitate interoperable exchange and the
trustworthiness of the data being  
exchanged. These enhancements to the comprehensiveness and reliability
of the data being  
exchanged could help empower physicians in the prevention and detection
of opioid misuse,  
abuse, and diversion.  
  
In addition, because we propose to adopt the USCDI as a standard, health
IT developers  
would be allowed to take advantage of the Maintenance of Certification
requirements described  
in section VII.B.5 of this proposed rule. Therefore, the USCDI would
have the potential to  
further benefit clinical priorities and interoperability for OUD,
including safe and appropriate  
opioid prescribing, through the ability to voluntarily implement and use
a new version of an  
adopted standard or implementation specification so long as certain
conditions are met, including  
the new version being approved by the National Coordinator for use in
certification through the

Standards Version Advancement Process. We seek comment on how this
proposal would further  
support the access, exchange, and use of additional and future data
classes (including structured  
data fields) in more care and practice settings specifically as related
to the prevention and  
treatment of OUD.  
• **Standardized API:** We are proposing new API functionality through
the adoption of a new  
API certification criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)), which serves to
implement the Cures Act  
requirement to permit health information to be accessed, exchanged, and
used from APIs  
without special effort. This criterion would enable efficient exchange
of health information  
using modern internet technologies and thus enable collaborative,
patient-driven, integrated  
care for individuals recovering from OUD.  
• **Data Segmentation for Privacy and Consent Management:** As discussed
in section  
IV.B.7, we are also proposing to remove the current 2015 Edition
DS4P-send (§  
170.315(b)(7)) and DS4P-receive (§ 170.315(b)(8)) certification
criteria. We propose to  
replace these two criteria with three new 2015 Edition DS4P
certification criteria (two for C-  
CDA ((§ 170.315(b)(12)) and (§ 170.315(b)(13)) and one for FHIR (§
170.315(g)(11))) that  
would support a more granular approach to privacy tagging data for
health information  
exchange supported by either the C-CDA- or FHIR-based exchange
standards. We believe  
this proposal would offer functionality that is more valuable to
providers and patients,  
especially given the complexities of the privacy law landscape for
multiple care and specialty  
settings. We also believe this proposal could lead to more complete
records, contribute to  
patient safety, and enhance care coordination. Additionally, we believe
this proposal may  
support a more usable display of OUD information at the request of
patients within an EHR

and we invite input on best practices, including the processes and
methods by which OUD  
information should be displayed.  
• **Electronic Prescribing and PDMPs:** As discussed in section IV.B.2,
we are proposing to  
remove the current 2015 Edition electronic prescribing certification
criterion (§  
170.315(b)(3)) and replace this criterion with a new electronic
prescribing certification  
criterion (§ 170.315(b)(11)) that would support improved patient safety
and prescription  
accuracy, create workflow efficiencies, reduce testing requirements, and
increase  
configurability of systems. This new proposed criterion includes the
addition of Risk  
Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) messages. We believe this
proposal would help  
address challenges discussed in the CMS Hospital Inpatient Prospective
Payment Systems  
final rule (83 FR 41651) and Medicare Physician Fee Schedule proposed
rule (83 FR 35704)  
by strengthening clinical and administrative efficiency, helping move
the industry forward by  
adopting more current standards for electronic prescribing, and
harmonizing efforts across  
federal agencies in the prevention and treatment of OUD. In addition,
the FDA has enacted  
an opioids medications REMS program for opioid
analgesics[49](ONCs.html#151)mandating prescriber and  
patient education to encourage proper patient screening and appropriate
monitoring.  
Adoption of the new proposed criterion also supports the efficient and
accurate exchange of  
medication history transactions between providers and pharmacies, and
between pharmacies  
and state PDMPs.

In addition to the certification criteria established in the 2015
Edition final rule and  
proposed in this rule, ONC is engaged in a number of health IT and
standards initiatives  
exploring innovation and emerging standards to inform future health IT
policy. In some cases,  
these efforts may not be mature enough or best suited for adoption in
the Program; however, we  
seek comment on the potential consideration of these initiatives for
future direction of ONC  
policy.  
• **CDS Hooks:** Improving how opioids are prescribed through
evidence-based guidelines can  
ensure patients have access to safer, more effective chronic pain
treatment while reducing the  
risk of opioid misuse, abuse, or overdose from these drugs. In response
to the critical need  
for consistent and current opioid prescribing guidelines, the Centers
for Disease Control and  
Prevention (CDC) released the Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for
Chronic Pain.[50](ONCs.html#152)While  
progress has been made in training prescribers and fostering the
adoption of the CDC  
guideline, the President’s Opioid
Commission[51](ONCs.html#152)acknowledged that “not all states have  
adopted the guideline, not all physicians are aware of them, and sound
opioid prescribing  
guidelines are far from universally followed.” Clinical decision support
(CDS) Hooks is a  
health IT specification that has the potential to positively affect
prescriber adoption of  
evidence-based prescribing guidelines by invoking patient-specific
clinical support from  
within the clinician’s EHR workflow. ONC is currently collaborating with
CDC on a project  
to translate the CDC guideline into standardized, shareable, computable
decision support  
artifacts using CDS Hooks. We recognize that CDS Hooks is still an
emerging technology

prescribing and  
OUD prevention and treatment. We also request public comment on other
health IT solutions  
and effective approaches to improve opioid prescription practices and
clinical decision

• **Care Plan FHIR Resource:** A shared care plan is a critical concept
for managing an  
individual’s health across a continuum that includes both clinical and
non-clinical settings[52](ONCs.html#153)  
and can help enable more informed and useful connections among all the
stakeholders  
engaged in preventing or treating OUD. For those in recovery from OUD,
the care plan can  
enable patients to access their care plan information and coordinate
their care with approved  
community care providers which is critical and part of evidence-based
recovery treatment  
services. In 2015, the ONC HITPC recommended that the National
Coordinator accelerate  
the implementation of dynamic, shared, longitudinal care plans that
incorporate information  
from both clinical and non-clinical services and empower individuals to
manage their own  
health and care.[53](ONCs.html#153) A consideration for HHS as part of
this earlier recommendation included  
looking at the future standards development needed to transition from
the static care plan  
documentation (document template in C-CDA R2.1) to a dynamic shared care
plan that  
supports more robust care coordination.[54](ONCs.html#153)We believe HL7
standards and standardized APIs  
can elevate care coordination and care management across the continuum,
including for those  
providers without EHRs, whether for opioid use disorder related
treatment, primary health, or  
other problems. Indeed, numerous efforts are underway within HL7 and
other
collaborations

to standardize “care plans” and their content using FHIR and the C-CDA.
From a technical  
perspective and in the context of the proposals focused on the USCDI
standard, the ARCH  
standard, the new proposed API certification criterion at
170.315(g)(10), and the voluntary  
Standards Version Advancement Process Maintenance of Certification
requirement described  
in section VII.B.5 of this proposed rule, we can see a future where a
(g)(10)-certified API  
would be capable of supporting care plan data. We request public comment
on the current  
maturity of existing and forthcoming technical specifications to support
care plan/care plan  
data as well as specific information that could be prioritized within a
future USCDI data class  
focused on care plans.  
In addition to commenting on the criteria noted in this section, we also
encourage  
stakeholders to participate in the ISA process.[55](ONCs.html#154) The
ISA represents the model by which ONC

standards and implementation specifications identified in the ISA as
applicable to the specific  
interoperability needs they seek to address and encourages pilot testing
and other industry  
experience adopting standards and implementation specifications
identified as “emerging” in the  
ISA. The web-based version of the ISA documents known limitations,
preconditions, and  
dependencies, and provide suggestions for security best practices in the

Additionally, through the ISA process, stakeholders are encouraged to
comment on the  
outlined standards and implementation specifications, as ONC updates the
ISA regularly. ONC  
has developed and has plans to develop further ISA content to highlight
standards and  
implementation specifications that support the prevention and treatment
of OUD/ substance use  
disorder (SUD). For example, the NCPDP SCRIPT standard allows a
prescriber to request a  
patient’s medication history from a state PDMP via the RxHistoryRequest
and  
RxHistoryResponse. ONC is also working to enhance the ISA to make it
easier for stakeholders  
to find standards and implementation specifications related to
high-priority use cases, such as  
OUD/SUD. The ISA has a comment process that occurs each year56 and we
encourage  
stakeholders to participate in that process to comment on other
standards and implementation  
specifications that currently exist in the ISA or that the industry and
its stakeholders feel should  
be added to the ISA that support OUD/SUD prevention, treatment,
monitoring, and care  
coordination.  
4\. Additional Comment Areas  
We further seek comment on effective approaches for the successful
dissemination and  
adoption of standards including the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard (see
section IV.B.2) that  
can support the exchange of PDMP data for integration into EHRs and also
enable further  
adoption and use of Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances
(EPCS). Regarding  
integration of health IT with PDMPs and EPCS, we believe there are real
and perceived  
challenges and opportunities that involve policy and technical
components. As we explore these  
issues in collaboration with industry and stakeholders, we seek comment
on the priority

challenges and opportunities for these topics and on any technical and
policy distinctions, as  
appropriate.  
We also note that there are many federal initiatives separate from ONC
proposed  
rulemaking and the Program that exist within HHS programs including, but
not limited to, CMS  
Medicaid and Medicare programs. For example, Medicare now provides
separate payment for  
psychiatric collaborative care model/behavioral health integration and
chronic care management  
services (see 81 FR 80233, and 80247), and Medicaid issued guidance on
leveraging technology  
to address the opioid crisis at enhanced funding
matches[56](ONCs.html#156)and also includes SUD health IT in  
standard terms and conditions as part of 1115 waiver requirements.  
In addition, CMS sought comment for consideration through separate
rulemaking in both  
the 2019 Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule (83 FR 35923) and Hospital
Inpatient  
Prospective Payment Systems proposed rule (83 FR 20528) regarding
whether they should adopt  
the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard to facilitate future reporting of the
proposed Query of  
PDMP quality measure. As noted in the Hospital Inpatient Prospective
Payment Systems final  
rule, a few commenters supported the use of NCPDP Script Standard
Implementation Guide  
Version 2017071 medication history transactions for PDMP queries and
response. Additionally,  
CMS encourages advances in standards and their use to deliver
innovative, interoperable  
solutions that will seamlessly integrate PDMP query functionality into
clinician-friendly, patient-  
centered CEHRT-enabled workflows that facilitate safer, more informed
prescribing practices  
and improved patient outcomes (83 FR
41651).

We seek comment on how successful implementation of health IT that
supports OUD can  
aid in the achievement of national and programmatic goals, especially
where they may align with  
initiatives across HHS and with stakeholder and industry led efforts.  
Finally, we seek comment on a topic that involves health IT for both
pediatric care and  
OUD prevention and treatment – Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (or NAS). In
its September  
2018 report, *Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General’s
Spotlight on Opioids,* the  
HHS Office of the Surgeon General describes how the incidence of
Neonatal Abstinence  
Syndrome (or NAS), has increased dramatically in the last decade along
with increased opioid  
misuse. Newborns may experience NAS, a withdrawal syndrome, following
exposure to drugs  
while in the mother’s womb. NAS is an expected and treatable condition
following repeated  
maternal substance use and abuse during pregnancy, which may have
long-term health  
consequences for the infant.  
Immediate newborn NAS signs include neurological excitability,
gastrointestinal  
dysfunction, and autonomic dysfunction. Newborns with NAS are more
likely than other babies  
to have low birthweight and respiratory complications. ONC believes the
pediatric clinical health  
IT recommendations proposed in this rule (including Priority 8, which
includes the linkage of  
health data in records of the mother and newborn) are important for
supporting newborns at birth  
and as they grow and receive care in various settings. As such, we
invite comment on:  
• The effective use of health IT itself in support of the NAS use case
as involves provider  
training, establishing workflow, and other related safety and usability
considerations.

• Existing and potential tools, such as decision support or clinical
quality measurement, for  
supporting children with NAS and on the specific data elements related
to the care of  
these children and use of these tools in practice.  
• Identification of any related criteria and the respective
corresponding proposed pediatric  
recommendation for the voluntary certification of health IT for use in
pediatric care that  
supports the NAS use case including but not limited to recommendation
number 8 noted  
above.  
We welcome public comment on these health IT policies, functionalities
and standards to  
support providers engaged in the treatment and prevention of OUD.  
**VII. Conditions and Maintenance of Certification**  
****  
Section 4002 of the Cures Act requires the Secretary of HHS, through
notice and  
comment rulemaking, to establish Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification requirements for  
the Program. Specifically, health IT developers or entities must adhere
to certain Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification requirements concerning information
blocking; appropriate  
exchange, access, and use of electronic health information;
communications regarding health IT;  
application programming interfaces (APIs); real world testing for
interoperability; attestations  
regarding certain Conditions and Maintenance of Certification
requirements; and submission of  
reporting criteria under the EHR reporting program.  
*A.* *Implementation*  
  
To implement Section 4002 of the Cures Act, we propose an approach
whereby the  
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification express both initial
requirements for health IT  
developers and their certified Health IT Module(s) as well as ongoing
requirements that must be

met by both health IT developers and their certified Health IT Module(s)
under the Program. If  
these requirements are not met, then the health IT developer may no
longer be able to participate  
in the Program and/or its certified health IT may have its certification
terminated. We propose to  
implement each Cures Act Condition of Certification with further
specificity as it applies to the  
Program. We also propose to establish the Maintenance of Certification
requirements for each  
Condition of Certification as standalone requirements. This approach
would establish clear  
baseline technical and behavior Conditions of Certification requirements
with evidence that the  
Conditions of Certification are continually being met through the
Maintenance of Certification  
requirements.  
*B. Provisions*  
  
1\. Information Blocking  
The Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and
Maintenance of  
Certification under the Program, not take any action that constitutes
"information blocking" as  
defined in section 3022(a) of the PHSA (see 3001(c)(5)(D)(i) of the
PHSA). We propose to  
establish this information blocking Condition of Certification in §
170.401. The Condition of  
Certification prohibits any health IT developer under the Program from
taking any action that  
constitutes information blocking as defined by section 3022(a) of the
PHSA and proposed in  
§ 171.103.  
  
We clarify that this proposed “information blocking” Condition of
Certification and its  
requirements would be substantive requirements of the Program and would
use the definition of  
"information blocking" established by section 3022(a) of the PHSA and as
also proposed in §  
171.103, as it relates to health IT developers of certified health IT.
In addition to ONC's statutory

authority for this Condition of Certification, the HHS Office of the
Inspector General (OIG) has  
both investigatory and enforcement authority over information blocking
and may issue civil  
money penalties for information blocking conducted by health IT
developers of certified health  
IT, health information networks and health information exchanges. OIG
may also investigate  
health care providers for information blocking for which health care
providers could be subject  
to disincentives.  
We refer readers to section VII.D of this proposed rule for additional
discussion of  
ONC’s enforcement of this and other proposed Conditions and Maintenance
of Certification  
requirements. We also refer readers to section VIII of this proposed
rule for our proposals to  
implement the information blocking provisions of the Cures Act,
including proposed § 171.103.  
****  
We do not, at this time, propose any associated Maintenance of
Certification  
requirements for this Condition of Certification.  
2\. Assurances ****  
  
The **** Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition
and Maintenance of  
Certification under the Program, provide assurances to the Secretary,
unless for legitimate  
purposes specified by the Secretary, that it will not take any action
that constitutes information  
blocking as defined in section 3022(a) of the PHSA, or any other action
that may inhibit the  
appropriate exchange, access, and use of electronic health information
(EHI). We propose to  
implement this Condition of Certification and accompanying Maintenance
of Certification  
requirements in § 170.402. As a Condition of Certification requirement,
a health IT developer  
must comply with the Condition as recited here and in the Cures Act. We
refer readers to section

VIII of this proposed rule for the proposed reasonable and necessary
activities specified by the  
Secretary, which constitute the exceptions to the information blocking
definition.  
We also propose to establish more specific Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification  
requirements for a health IT developer to provide assurances that it
does not take any action that  
may inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of EHI. These
proposed requirements  
serve to provide further clarity under the Program as to how health IT
developers can provide  
such broad assurances with more specific actions.  
a. Full Compliance and Unrestricted Implementation of Certification
Criteria  
Capabilities  
  
We propose, as a Condition of Certification, that a health IT developer
must ensure that  
its health IT certified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program
(Program) conforms to  
the full scope of the certification criteria to which its health IT is
certified. This has always been an  
expectation of ONC and users of certified health IT and, importantly, a
requirement of the Program.  
We believe, however, that by incorporating this expectation and
requirement as a Condition of  
Certification under the Program, there would be assurances, and
documentation via the  
“Attestations” Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements
proposed in § 170.406,  
that all health IT developers fully understand their responsibilities
under the Program, including not  
to take any action with their certified health IT that may inhibit the
appropriate exchange, access,  
and use of EHI. To this point, certification criteria are designed and
issued so that certified health  
IT can support interoperability and the appropriate exchange, access,
and use of electronic health  
information.

process. The document published in the Federal Register is the official
HHS-approved document.  

-----

<span id="162"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **162** of **724**  
  
  
We propose that, as a complementary Condition of Certification, health
IT developers of  
certified health IT must provide an assurance that they have made
certified capabilities available  
in ways that enable them to be implemented and used in production
environments for their  
intended purposes. More specifically, developers would be prohibited
from taking any action that  
could interfere with a user’s ability to access or use certified
capabilities for any purpose within  
the scope of the technology’s certification. Such actions may inhibit
the appropriate access,  
exchange, or use of EHI and are therefore contrary to this proposed
Condition of Certification  
and the statutory provision that it implements. While such actions are
already prohibited under  
the Program (80 FR 62711), making these existing requirements explicit
would ensure that  
health IT developers are required to attest to them on a regular basis
pursuant to the Condition of  
Certification proposed in § 170.406, which will in turn provide
additional assurances to the  
Secretary that developers of certified health IT support and do not
inhibit appropriate access,  
exchange, or use of EHI.  
By way of example, actions that would violate this aspect of the
proposed Condition  
include failing to fully deploy or enable certified capabilities;
imposing limitations (including  
restrictions) on the use of certified capabilities once deployed; or
requiring subsequent developer  
assistance to enable the use of certified capabilities, contrary to the
intended uses and outcomes  
of those capabilities (*see* 80 FR 62711). The Condition would also be
violated were a developer  
to refuse to provide documentation, support, or other assistance
reasonably necessary to enable  
the use of certified capabilities for their intended purposes (*see* 80
FR 62711). More generally,  
any action that would be likely to substantially impair the ability of
one or more users (or  
prospective users) to implement or use certified capabilities for any
purpose within the scope of

<span id="163"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **163** of **724**  
  
applicable certification criteria would be prohibited by this Condition
(*see* 80 FR 62711). Such  
actions may include imposing limitations or additional types of costs,
especially if these were not  
disclosed when a customer purchased or licensed the certified health IT
(*see* 80 FR 62711).  
b. Certification to the “Electronic Health Information Export”
Criterion  
We propose, as a Condition of Certification requirement, that a health
IT developer that  
produces and electronically manages EHI must certify health IT to the
2015 Edition “electronic  
health information export” certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(10).
We discuss the proposed  
“electronic health information (EHI) export” criterion in section IV.B.4
of this proposed rule.  
Further, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement, we propose that
a health IT developer  
that produces and electronically manages EHI must provide all of its
customers of certified  
health IT with health IT certified to the functionality included in §
170.315(b)(10) within 24  
months of a subsequent final rule’s effective date or within 12 months
of certification for a health  
IT developer that never previously certified health IT to the 2015
Edition, whichever is longer.  
Consistent with these proposals, we also propose to amend § **** 170.550
to require that ONC-ACBs  
certify health IT to the proposed 2015 Edition “EHI export” when the
health IT developer of the  
health IT presented for certification produces and electronically
manages EHI.  
As discussed in section IV.C.1 of this proposed rule, the availability
of the capabilities in  
the proposed 2015 Edition “EHI export” certification criterion to
providers and patients would  
promote access, exchange, and use of EHI to facilitate health care
providers in switching  
practices and health IT systems and patients’ electronic access to all
their health information  
stored by a provider. As such, health IT developers with health IT
certified to the proposed 2015  
Edition “EHI export” certification criterion that is made available to
its customers provides

<span id="164"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **164** of **724**  
  
assurances that the developer is not taking actions that constitute
information blocking or any  
other action that may inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use
of EHI.  
c. Records and Information Retention  
  
We propose that, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement, a health
IT developer  
must, for a period of 10 years beginning from the date of certification,
retain all records and  
information necessary that demonstrate initial and ongoing compliance
with the requirements of  
the ONC Health IT Certification Program. In other words, records and
information should be  
retained starting from the date a developer first certifies health IT
under the Program and applies  
separately to each unique Health IT Module (or Complete EHR, as
applicable) certified under  
the Program. This retention of records is necessary to verify health IT
developer compliance with  
Program requirements, including certification criteria and Conditions of
Certification. We  
believe that 10 years is an appropriate period of time given that many
users of certified health IT  
participate in various CMS programs, as well as other programs, that
require similar periods of  
records retention. We also refer readers to section VII.D.3.c of this
preamble for additional  
discussion of records access to information necessary to enforce the
Conditions and Maintenance  
of Certification.  
  
In an effort to reduce administrative burden, we also propose, that in
situations where  
applicable certification criteria are removed from the Code of Federal
Regulations before the 10  
years have expired, records must only be kept for 3 years from the date
of removal for those  
certification criteria and related Program provisions unless that
timeframe would exceed the  
overall 10-year retention period. This “3-year from the date of removal”
records retention period

also aligns with the records retention requirements for ONC-ACBs and
ONC-ATLs under the  
Program.  
  
We encourage comment on these proposals and whether the proposed
requirements can  
provide adequate assurances that certified health IT developers are
demonstrating initial and  
ongoing compliance with the requirements of the Program; and thereby
ensuring that certified  
health IT can support interoperability, and appropriate exchange,
access, and use of EHI.  
d. Trusted Exchange Framework and the Common Agreement – Request for  
Information  
The Cures Act added section 3001(c)(9) to the PHSA, which requires the
National  
Coordinator to work with stakeholders with the goal of developing or
supporting a Trusted  
Exchange Framework and a Common Agreement (collectively, “TEFCA”) for
the purpose of  
ensuring full network-to-network exchange of health information. Section
3001(c)(9)(B) outlines  
a process for establishing a TEFCA between health information networks
(HINs)—including  
provisions for the National Coordinator, in collaboration with the NIST,
to provide technical  
assistance on implementation and pilot testing of the TEFCA. In
accordance with section  
3001(c)(9)(C), the National Coordinator shall publish the TEFCA on its
website and in the  
**Federal Register,** as well as annually publish on its website a
directory of the HINs that have  
adopted the Common Agreement and are capable of trusted exchange
pursuant to the Common  
Agreement. The process, application, and construction of the TEFCA are
further outlined in  
section 3001(c)(9)(D), including requiring that the Secretary shall
through notice and comment  
rulemaking, establish a process for HINs that voluntarily adopt the
TEFCA to attest to such  
adoption. We request comment as to whether certain health IT developers
should be required to

<span id="166"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **166** of **724**  
  
participate in the TEFCA as a means of providing assurances to their
customers and ONC that  
they are not taking actions that constitute information blocking or any
other action that may  
inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of EHI. We would
expect that such a  
requirement, if proposed in a subsequent rulemaking, would apply to
health IT developers that  
have a Health IT Module(s) certified to any of the certification
criteria in §§ 170.315(b)(1),  
(c)(1) and (c)(2), (e)(1), (f), and (g)(9) through (11); and provide
services for connection to  
health information networks (HINs). These services could be routing EHI
through a HIN or  
responding to requests for EHI from a HIN.  
We have identified health IT developers that certify health IT to the
criteria above  
because the capabilities included in the criteria support access and
exchange of EHI. Therefore,  
we believe such health IT developers, as opposed to a health IT
developer that only supports  
clinical decision support (§ 170.315(a)(9)) with its certified health
IT, would be best suited to  
participate in the Trusted Exchange Framework and adhere to the Common
Agreement.  
Similarly, we believe that many such health IT developers with the
identified certified health IT  
would be in position, and requested by customers, to provide connection
services to HINs. When  
such criteria are met (certified to the identified criteria above and
actually providing connection  
services), participation in the Trusted Exchange Framework and adherence
to the Common  
Agreement are consistent with this Condition and Maintenance of
Certification as specified by  
the Cures Act, the intent of Congress to establish widespread
interoperability and exchange of  
health information without information blocking, and supports ONC’s
responsibility, as  
established by the HITECH Act, to develop and support a nationwide
health IT infrastructure  
that allows for the electronic use and exchange of information. More

certification  
criteria we have identified as the basis for health IT developer
participation in the Trusted  
Exchange Framework and adherence to the Common Agreement, other
certification criteria that  
would serve as a basis for health IT developer participation in the
Trusted Exchange Framework  
and adherence to the Common Agreement, and whether the current structure
of the Trusted  
Exchange Framework and Common Agreement are conducive to health IT
developer  
participation and in what manner. ****  
3\. Communications  
  
The Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and
Maintenance of  
Certification under the Program, does not prohibit or restrict
communication regarding the  
following subjects:  
• The usability of the health information technology;  
• The interoperability of the health information technology;  
• The security of the health information technology;  
• Relevant information regarding users' experiences when using the
health information  
technology;

• The business practices of developers of health information technology
related to exchanging  
electronic health information; and  
• The manner in which a user of the health information technology has
used such technology.  
  
We propose to implement this Condition of Certification and its
requirements in §  
170.403. The Cures Act placed no limitations on the protection of the
communications  
delineated above (referred to hereafter as “protected communications”).
As such, we propose to  
broadly interpret the subject matter of communications that are
protected from developer  
prohibition or restriction as well as the conduct of developers that
implicate the protection  
afforded to communications by this Condition of Certification and
discuss this proposed  
approach in detail below. While we propose to implement a broad general
prohibition against  
developers imposing prohibitions and restrictions on protected
communications, we also  
recognize that there are circumstances where it is both legitimate and
reasonable for developers  
to limit the sharing of information about their products. As such, we
propose to allow developers  
to impose prohibitions or restrictions on protected communications in
certain narrowly defined  
circumstances. In order for a prohibition or restriction on a protected
communication to be  
permitted, we propose that it must pass a two-part test. First, the
communication that is being  
prohibited or restricted must not fall within a class of communication
about which no restriction  
or prohibition would ever be legitimate or reasonable—such as
communications required by law,  
made to a government agency, or made to a defined category of safety
organizations—and which  
we refer to hereafter as “communications with unqualified protection.”
Second, to be permitted,  
a developer’s prohibition or restriction must also fall within a
prescribed category of  
circumstances for which we propose it is both legitimate and reasonable
for a developer to limit

the sharing of information about its products. This would be because of
the nature of the  
relationship between the developer and the communicator or because of
the nature of the  
information that is, or could be, the subject of the communication
(referred to hereafter as  
“permitted prohibitions and restrictions”). A restriction or prohibition
that does not satisfy this  
two-part test will contravene this Condition of Certification. As
discussed in more detail below,  
we propose that this two-part test strikes a reasonable balance between
the need to promote open  
communication about health IT and related business practices, and the
need to protect the  
legitimate interests of health IT developers and other entities.  
a. Background and Purpose  
  
This Condition of Certification addresses industry practices that
severely limit the ability  
and willingness of health IT customers, users, researchers, and other
stakeholders who use and  
work with health IT to openly discuss and share their experiences and
other relevant information  
about the performance of health IT, including the ability of health IT
to exchange health  
information electronically. These practices result in a lack of
transparency around health IT that  
can contribute to and exacerbate patient safety risks, system security
vulnerabilities, and product  
performance issues. As discussed below, these issues have been
documented and reported on  
over a number of years.  
  
The challenges presented by health IT developer actions that prohibit or
restrict  
communications have been examined for some time. The problem was
identified in a 2012 report  
by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (IOM) entitled
“Health IT and Patient

Safety: Building Safer Systems for Better Care”[57](ONCs.html#170)(IOM
Report). The IOM Report stated that  
health care providers, researchers, consumer groups other health IT
users lack information  
regarding the functionality of health IT.[58](ONCs.html#170)The IOM
Report observed, relatedly, that many  
developers restrict the information that users can communicate about
developers’ products  
through nondisclosure clauses, confidentiality clauses, intellectual
property protections, hold-  
harmless clauses, and other boilerplate contract
language.[59](ONCs.html#170)Importantly, the IOM Report found  
that such clauses discourage users from sharing information about
patient safety risks related to  
health IT, which significantly limits the ability of health IT users to
understand how health IT  
impacts patient safety.[60](ONCs.html#170) The report stressed the need
for health IT developers to enable the free  
exchange of information regarding the experience of using their health
IT products, including the  
sharing of screenshots.[61](ONCs.html#170)  
  
Other close observers of health IT have similarly noted that broad
restrictions on  
communications can inhibit the communication of information about errors
and adverse events.[62](ONCs.html#170)  
Concerns have also been raised by researchers of health IT
products,[63](ONCs.html#170) who emphasize that  
confidentiality and intellectual property provisions in contracts often
place broad and unclear

limits on authorized uses of information related to health IT, which in
turn seriously impacts the  
ability of researchers to conduct and publish their
research.[64](ONCs.html#171)  
  
The issue of health IT developers prohibiting or restricting
communications about health  
IT has been the subject of a series of hearings by the Senate Committee
on Health, Education,  
Labor and Pensions (HELP Committee), starting in the spring of 2015.
During several hearings,  
stakeholders emphasized the lack of transparency around the performance
of health IT in a live  
environment, noting that this can undermine a competitive marketplace,
hinder innovation, and  
prevent improvements in the safety and usability of the technology.[65,
66](ONCs.html#171) Additionally, the HELP  
Committee indicated serious concerns regarding the reported efforts of
health IT developers to  
restrict, by contract and other means, communications regarding user
experience, including  
information relevant to safety and
interoperability.[67](ONCs.html#171)When one Senator asked a panel of  
experts—which included a health IT developer—if there were any reasons
for health IT contracts  
to have confidentiality clauses restricting users of health information
technology from discussing  
their experience of using the health IT, all panel members agreed that
such clauses should be  
prohibited.[68](ONCs.html#171)  
  
Prior to the HELP Committee hearings described above, the issue of
developers  
prohibiting and restricting communications about the performance of
their health IT was also

addressed in House Energy and Commerce Committee hearings when committee
members heard  
testimony and held discussions related to the Cures
Act.[69](ONCs.html#172)Commentary by witnesses at the  
hearings emphasized the need to ensure that health IT products are safe
and encouraged the  
availability of information around health IT products to improve quality
and ensure patient  
safety.  
Developer actions that prohibit or restrict communications about health
IT have also been  
the subject of investigative reporting.[70](ONCs.html#172) A September
2015 report examined eleven contracts  
between health systems and major health IT developers and found that,
with one exception, all of  
the contracts protected large amounts of information from being
disclosed, including information  
related to safety and performance issues.[71](ONCs.html#172)The report
stated that broad confidentiality and  
intellectual property protection clauses were the greatest barriers to
allowing the communication  
of information regarding potential safety issues and adverse
events.[72](ONCs.html#172)  
  
Finally, ONC has itself been made aware of health IT developer contract
language that  
purports to prohibit the disclosure of information about health IT,
including even a customer’s or  
user’s opinions and conclusions about the performance and other aspects
of the technology. Our  
extensive interactions with health care providers, researchers, and
other stakeholders consistently  
indicate that such terms are not uncommon and that some developers may
actively enforce them  
and engage in other practices to discourage communications regarding
developers’ health IT  
products and related business practices.

This proposed Condition of Certification is needed to significantly
improve transparency  
around the functioning of health IT in the field. This will help ensure
that the health IT ultimately  
selected and used by health care providers and others functions as
expected, is less likely to have  
safety issues or implementation difficulties, enables greater
interoperability of health  
information, and more fully allows users to reap the benefits of health
IT utilization, including  
improvements in care and quality, and reductions in costs.  
b. **** Condition of Certification Requirements  
i. Protected Communications and Communicators  
  
We propose that the protection afforded to communicators under this
Condition of  
Certification would apply irrespective of the form or medium in which
the communication is  
made. Developers must not prohibit or restrict communications whether
written, oral, electronic  
or by any other method if they concern protected communications, unless
permitted otherwise by  
this Condition of Certification. Similarly, this Condition of
Certification does not impose any  
limit on the identity of the communicators that are able to benefit from
the protection afforded,  
except that employees and contractors of a health IT developer may be
treated differently when  
making communications that are not afforded unqualified protection under
§ 170.403(a)(2)(i).  
This Condition of Certification is not limited to communications by
health IT customers (e.g.,  
providers) who have contracts with health IT developers. Entities or
individuals who enter into  
agreements with a developer in connection with the developer’s health IT
– for example, a data  
analytics vendor who is required to sign a non-disclosure agreement
before being granted access  
to the developer’s health IT – would also be covered by the protection
afforded to  
communicators under this Condition of Certification. Patients, health IT
researchers, industry

groups, and health information exchanges would be able to make protected
communications  
about the health IT free of impermissible prohibitions or restrictions.
Similarly, the Condition of  
Certification would also extend to potential customers of health IT who
are provided with  
product or software demonstrations, irrespective of whether they proceed
with the acquisition of  
the technology. Examples of other protected communications include, but
are not limited to:  
• a post made to an online forum;  
• the sharing of screenshots, subject to certain proposed restrictions
on their general  
publication;  
• an unattributed written review by a health IT user;  
• a quote given by a health care executive to a journalist;  
• a presentation given at a trade show;  
• a social media post;  
• a product review posted on a video-sharing service such as YouTube;  
• the statements and conclusions made in a peer-reviewed journal; and  
• private communications made between health IT customers about the
health IT.  
ii. Protected Subject Areas  
  
The Cures Act (and § 170.403(a)(1)) identifies a list of subject areas
about which  
developers cannot prohibit or restrict communications. These subject
areas address health IT  
performance and usability, health IT security, and the business
practices related to exchanging  
EHI. For the reasons discussed below, we propose that the terms used to
describe the subject  
areas should be construed broadly, consistent with the scope of
communications that Congress

specified in the Act. We encourage comment on whether the types of
subject matter we identify  
below are adequate to protect the full range of communications
contemplated by the Cures Act.  
*(A) Usability of Health Information Technology *****  
The term “usability” is not defined in the Cures Act nor in any other
relevant statutory  
provisions. In the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Usability Initiative,  
NIST describes “usability” of health IT by referencing the
ISO[73](ONCs.html#175) standard, ISO9241: usability is  
"the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve
specified goals with  
effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of
use."[74](ONCs.html#175)Separately, HIMSS[75](ONCs.html#175)  
has recognized the following principles of software usability:
Simplicity; Naturalness;  
Consistency; Forgiveness and Feedback; Effective Use of Language;
Efficient Interactions;  
Effective Information Presentation; Preservation of Context; and
Minimize Cognitive Load.[76](ONCs.html#175) As  
these organizations have expressed, there are a multitude of factors
that contribute to any  
judgment about “usability,” and any assessment about the usability of
health IT should  
appropriately rest on the factors contributing to the effectiveness,
efficiency, and performance  
offered. As such, we propose that the “usability” of health IT be
construed broadly to include  
both an overall judgment on the “usability” of a particular health IT
product, as well as any  
factor that contributes to usability. Factors of usability that could be
the subject of protected  
communications include, but are not limited to: the user interface

of information;  
cognitive burden; cognitive support; error tolerance; clinical decision
support; alerts; error  
handling; customizability; use of templates; mandatory data elements;
the use of text fields; and  
customer support.  
*(B) Interoperability of Health Information Technology *****  
  
Section 3000(9) of the PHSA, as amended by the Cures Act, provides a
definition of  
“interoperability” that describes a type of health IT that demonstrates
the necessary capabilities  
to be interoperable. For the purposes of this Condition of
Certification, we propose that protected  
communications regarding the “interoperability of health IT” would
include communications  
about whether a health IT product and associated developer business
practices meet the  
interoperability definition described in section 3000(9) of the PHSA,
including communications  
about aspects of the technology or developer that fall short of the
expectations found in that  
definition. This will include communications about the interoperability
capabilities of health IT  
and the practices of a health IT developer that may inhibit the access,
exchange, or use of EHI,  
including information blocking. ****  
*(C) Security of Health IT *****  
  
The security of health information technology is primarily addressed
under the HIPAA  
Security Rule[77](ONCs.html#176), which establishes national standards
to protect individuals’ electronic protected  
health information (ePHI) that is created, received, maintained, or
transmitted by a covered entity  
or business associate. Covered entities and business associates must
ensure the confidentiality,

<span id="177"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **177** of **724**  
  
integrity, and availability of all such ePHI; protect against any
reasonably anticipated threats or  
hazards to the security or integrity of such information; and protect
against any reasonably  
anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are not
permitted or required under the  
HIPAA Privacy Rule.[78](ONCs.html#177) HIPAA requires that health IT
developers, to the extent that they are  
business associates of HIPAA-covered entities, implement appropriate
administrative, physical,  
and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and
security of ePHI.  
  
We propose that the matters that fall within the topic of health IT
security should be  
broadly construed to include any safeguards, whether or not required by
the Security Rule, that  
may be implemented (or not implemented) by a developer to ensure the
confidentiality, integrity,  
and security of the wider set of EHI (including ePHI), together with the
health IT product’s  
performance regarding security. For example, a developer may not
prohibit or restrict a potential  
communicator from communicating about, without limitation:  
• the approach to security adopted for the health IT at issue (e.g.,
architectural approach or  
authentication methodology);  
• the resilience of the health IT;  
• identified security flaws in the developer’s health IT; or  
• the response to cyber threats or security breaches by the developer.  
*(D) User Experiences *****  
  
The phrase “user experience” is not defined in the Cures Act nor in any
other relevant  
statutory provisions. We propose to afford these terms their ordinary
meaning. To qualify as a  
“user experience,” the experience must be one that is had by a user of
health IT. However,  
  
78 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164.  
****  
**NOTICE**  
**** This HHS-approved document has been submitted to the Office of the
Federal Register (OFR) for publication and  
has not yet been placed on public display or published in the Federal
Register. The document may vary slightly  
from the published document if minor editorial changes have been made

process. The document published in the Federal Register is the official
HHS-approved document.  

-----

<span id="178"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **178** of **724**  
  
beyond this, we do not propose to qualify the types of experiences that
would receive protection  
under the Condition on the basis of the “user experience” subject area.
This reflects the great  
variety of experiences that users may have with health IT and the often
subjective nature of such  
experiences. Thus, we believe that if the user had the experience, the
experience is relevant.  
  
To illustrate the breadth of potential user experiences that would be
protected by this  
Condition of Certification, we propose that communications about
“relevant information  
regarding users' experiences when using the health IT” would encompass,
for example,  
communications and information about a person or organization’s
experience acquiring,  
implementing, using, or otherwise interacting with health IT. This
includes experiences  
associated with the use of the health IT in the delivery of health care,
together with  
administrative functions performed using the health IT. User experiences
would also include the  
experiences associated with configuring and using the technology
throughout implementation,  
training, and in practice. Further, user experiences would include
patients’ and consumers’ user  
experiences with consumer apps, patient portals, and other
consumer-facing technologies. To be  
clear, a “relevant user experience” includes any aspect of the health IT
user experience that could  
positively or negatively impact the effectiveness or performance of the
health IT.  
*(E) Manner in Which a User has Used Health IT *****  
  
We propose that protected communications regarding the “manner in which
a user has  
used health IT” would encompass any information related to how the
health IT has been used in  
practice. This subject area largely overlaps with the matters covered
under the “user experience”  
subject area but may include additional perspectives or details beyond
those experienced by a

• the specific conditions under which a user used the health IT, such as
information about  
constraints imposed on health IT functionality due to implementation
decisions; and  
• information about the ways in which health IT could not be used or did
not function as was  
represented by the developer.  
*(F) Business Practices Related to Exchange *****  
  
We propose that the subject matter of “developer business practices
related to exchanging  
electronic health information” should be broadly construed to include
developer policies and  
practices that facilitate the exchange of electronic health information,
and developer policies and  
practices that impact the ability of health IT to exchange health
information. We further propose  
that the exchange of electronic health information encompasses the
appropriate and timely  
sharing of electronic health information.  
  
We propose that protected communications include, but are not limited
to:  
• the costs charged by a developer for products or services that support
the exchange of  
electronic health information (e.g., interface costs, API licensing fees
and royalties,  
maintenance and subscription fees, transaction or usage-based costs for
exchanging  
information);

• the timeframes and terms on which developers will or will not enable
connections and  
facilitate exchange with other technologies, individuals, or entities,
including other health IT  
developers, exchanges, and networks;  
• the developer’s approach to participation in health information
exchanges and/or networks;  
• the developer’s licensing practices and terms as it relates to making
available APIs and other  
aspects of its technology that enable the development and deployment of
interoperable  
products and services; and  
• the developer’s approach to creating interfaces with third-party
products or services,  
including whether connections are treated as “one off” customizations,
or whether similar  
types of connections can be implemented at a reduced cost.  
Importantly, we further propose that information regarding business
practices related to  
exchanging electronic health information would include information about
the switching costs  
imposed by a developer, as we are aware that the cost of switching
health IT is a significant  
factor impacting health care providers adopting the most
exchange-friendly health IT products  
that are available.  
iii. Meaning of “Prohibit or Restrict” **  
  
The terms “prohibit” and “restrict” are not defined in the Cures Act or
in any other  
relevant statutory provisions. As discussed in detail below,
communications can be prohibited or  
restricted through contractual terms or agreements (e.g., non-disclosure
agreements, non-  
disparagement clauses) as well as through conduct, including punitive or
retaliatory business  
practices that are designed to create powerful disincentives to engaging
in communications about  
developers or their products. Therefore, we propose that this Condition
of Certification would

not be limited to only formal prohibitions or restrictions (such as by
means of contracts or  
agreements) and would encompass any conduct by a developer that would be
likely to restrict a  
communication or class of communications protected by this Condition, as
discussed in detail  
below.  
  
The conduct in question must have some nexus to the making of a
protected  
communication or an attempted or contemplated protected communication.
That is, conduct by a  
developer that may be perceived as intimidating or punitive would not
implicate this Condition  
of Certification unless that conduct was designed to directly or
indirectly influence the making of  
a protected communication. Similarly, health IT contracts may include
terms that govern the  
manner in which the parties conduct themselves, and those terms would
not implicate this  
Condition of Certification unless the operative effect of a term was to
restrict or prohibit a  
protected communication. For abundant clarity, we note that the fact
that a customer’s health IT  
product is not performing in the manner the customer expected, or in the
manner that the  
developer promised, would not, in itself be evidence that the developer
is engaging in conduct  
that restricts or prohibits a protected communication. Rather, a nexus
must exist between the  
alleged poor performance and the making of (or attempting or
contemplating to make) a  
protected communication.  
We note that contractual prohibitions or restrictions on communications
can, in limited  
circumstances, be legitimate and serve an important role in protecting
proprietary information  
and intellectual property that are essential for health IT developers to
innovate and compete. On  
this basis, we propose to permit certain types of prohibitions and
restrictions, subject to strict

conditions to ensure that they are narrowly tailored and do not restrict
protected communications.  
These permitted prohibitions and restrictions are discussed in section
VII.B.3.b.v below.  
*(A) Prohibitions or Restrictions Arising by Way of Contract *****  
  
The principal way that health IT developers can control the disclosure
of information  
about their health IT is through contractual prohibitions or
restrictions. Such prohibitions or  
restrictions can arise in contractual provisions that address, for
example, confidentiality  
obligations, intellectual property protections, hold-harmless
requirements, nondisclosure  
obligations, non-compete obligations, and publicity rights.  
There are different ways that contractual prohibitions or restrictions
arise. In some  
instances a contractual prohibition or restriction will be expressed,
and the precise nature and  
scope of the prohibition or restriction will be explicit from the face
of the contract or agreement.  
For example, a contract will say that the health IT customer must not
disclose screenshots of the  
health IT. However, more often, a contract will impose prohibitions or
restrictions in less precise  
terms. For example, a health IT contract might use broad language when
describing the  
information or materials that customers and users are forbidden from
disclosing pursuant to a  
confidentiality clause, casting a vague net over the developer’s
“proprietary” information and  
purporting to cover information that may be neither confidential,
secret, nor protected by law. A  
contract does not need to expressly prohibit or restrict a protected
communication in order to  
have the effect of prohibiting or restricting that protected
communication. The use of broad or  
vague language that obfuscates the types of communications that can and
cannot be made may  
be treated as a prohibition or restriction if it has the effect of
restricting legitimate  
communications about health IT.

<span id="183"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **183** of **724**  
  
  
Restrictions and prohibitions found in contracts used by developers to
sell or license their  
health IT products can apply to customers directly and can require that
the customer “flow-  
down” obligations onto the customer’s employees, contractors, and other
individuals or entities  
that use or work with the developer’s health IT. Such contract
provisions would not comply with  
this Condition of Certification if they prohibit or restrict protected
communications. Prohibitions  
or restrictions on communications can also be found in separate
nondisclosure agreements  
(NDAs) that developers require their customers—and in some instances the
users of the health  
IT—to enter into in order to receive or access the health IT. We propose
that such agreements are  
covered by this Condition of Certification. Finally, health IT
developers typically may require  
third-party contractors used by their customers (such as a data
analytics vendor engaged by a  
health care provider to analyze the provider’s data) to enter into a NDA
with the developer  
before commencing their contract activities. In some extreme cases, the
employees of these  
third-party contractors are required to sign NDAs in their personal
capacities. These NDAs  
typically include obligations that prohibit or restrict communications
about the developer’s  
health IT products, and we propose that any such prohibitions or
restrictions within the context  
of protected communications as defined here would be subject to this
Condition of Certification.  
*(B) Prohibitions or Restrictions that Arise by Way of Conduct *****  
  
We are aware that some health IT developers engage in conduct that has
the effect of  
prohibiting or restricting protected communications. This conduct may
arise despite the  
developer’s contract and/or business associate agreement being silent
on, or even expressly  
permitting, the protected communication. The effect of such conduct can
be significant, as health  
care providers are dependent on their health IT developer in order to
receive critical software

updates or other maintenance services, and sometimes have little
bargaining power. Similarly, a  
third-party developer is dependent on a health IT developer’s
authorization in order to perform  
work in connection with the developer’s health IT.  
  
We propose that conduct that has the effect of prohibiting or
restricting a protected  
communication would be subject to this Condition of Certification. We
emphasize that, as  
discussed above, the conduct in question must have some nexus to the
making of a protected  
communication or an attempted or contemplated protected communication.
As such, developer  
conduct that was alleged to be intimidating, or health IT performance
that was perceived to be  
substandard, would not, in and of itself, implicate this Condition of
Certification unless there was  
some nexus between the conduct or performance issue and the making of
(or attempting or  
threatening to make) a protected communication. Examples of conduct that
could implicate this  
Condition of Certification include, but are not limited to:  
• Taking steps to enforce, including by threatening to enforce, a right
arising under contract  
that contravenes this Condition of Certification.  
• Taking steps to enforce, including by threatening to enforce, a legal
right that purports to  
prohibit or restrict a protected communication. This would include, for
example, the making  
of threats, such as via a cease and desist letter, to a researcher who
has made a protected  
communication.  
• Employing a technological measure (within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. §
1201) that a user  
would have to circumvent in order to make a protected communication, for
example, a  
technological measure that a health IT user would need to circumvent in
order to take a  
screenshot of the developer’s health IT.

• Discouraging the making of protected communications by:  
o Making threats against a health care customer (e.g., by threatening to
withhold the  
latest version of the developer’s software) in response to the customer
making or  
attempting to make a protected communication.  
o Taking retaliatory action against a person or entity that has made a
protected  
communication (e.g., withholding support, delaying the provider’s
adoption of a new  
software release, or removing a provider from the developer’s “preferred
customer”  
list).  
• Having policies that disadvantage persons or entities that make
protected communications  
(e.g., a policy that bars a provider from qualifying for the developer’s
“preferred customer”  
list if it shares screenshots in a manner protected by this Condition of
Certification).  
• Refusing to publish—or refusing to remove or delete—protected
communications made in an  
online forum that the developer moderates or controls.  
• Causing the removal or deletion of a protected communication from any
publication (e.g., a  
YouTube Copyright Take-down Notice that does not raise a legitimate
copyright claim).  
iv. Communications with Unqualified Protection  
  
We propose, and discuss below, a narrow class of
communications—consisting of five  
specific types of communications—that would receive unqualified
protection from developer  
prohibitions or restrictions. With respect to communications with
unqualified protection, a  
developer would be prohibited from imposing *any* prohibition or
restriction. As discussed below,  
we propose that this narrow class of communications warrants unqualified
protection because of  
the strength of the public policy interest being advanced by the
communication and/or the

sensitivity with which the identified recipient treats, and implements
safeguards to protect the  
confidentiality and security of, the information received. A developer
that imposes a prohibition  
or restriction on a communication with unqualified protection would fail
the first part of the two-  
part test for allowable prohibitions or restrictions, and as such would
contravene the Condition of  
Certification.  
  
  
  
  
*(A)* *Disclosures Required by Law*  
  
We propose that where a communication relates to subject areas
enumerated in  
§ 170.403(a)(1) and there are federal, state, or local laws that would
require the disclosure of  
information related to health IT, developers must not prohibit or
restrict in any way protected  
communications made in compliance with those laws. We note that we
expect that most health  
IT contracts would allow for, or at the very least not prohibit or
restrict, any communication or  
disclosure that is required by law, such as responding to a court or
Congressional subpoena, or a  
valid warrant presented by law enforcement. We further propose that if
required by law, a  
potential communicator should not have to delay any protected
communication under this  
Condition of Certification. Furthermore, we propose that the reasonable
limitations and  
prohibitions that are discussed below and permitted by § 170.403(a)(2)
do *not* apply to these  
types of protected communications.  
*(B) Communicating Information About Adverse Events, Hazards,*  
*and Other Unsafe Conditions to Government Agencies, Health*  
*Care Accreditation Organizations, and Patient Safety*  
*Organizations*  
****

Federal Register (OFR) for publication and  
has not yet been placed on public display or published in the Federal

<span id="187"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **187** of **724**  
  
  
It is well established that there is a strong public interest in
allowing open communication  
of information regarding health care hazards, adverse events, and unsafe
conditions. Given the  
central role played by health IT in the delivery of care, information
about health IT is a critical  
component of any investigation into the cause of hazards, adverse
events, or unsafe conditions.  
On the basis of this public policy interest alone, we propose there is
an overwhelming interest in  
ensuring that all communications about health IT that are necessary to
identify patient safety  
risks, and to make health IT safer, not be encumbered by prohibitions or
restrictions imposed by  
health IT developers that may affect the extent or timeliness of
communications. In addition to  
the public policy interest in promoting uninhibited communications about
health IT safety, the  
recognized communication channels for adverse events, hazards, and
unsafe conditions provide  
protections that help ensure that any disclosures made are appropriately
handled and kept  
confidential and secure. Indeed, the class of recipients to which the
information can be  
communicated under this category of communications with unqualified
protection should  
provide health IT developers with comfort that there is very little risk
of such communications  
prejudicing the developer’s intellectual property rights. For example,
government agencies  
impose appropriate controls on information they receive, mitigating any
risk that developers may  
feel arises from the disclosure of information about their health IT.
Similarly, accrediting bodies  
for health care delivery observe strict confidentiality policies for
information received or  
developed during the accreditation process and in connection with
complaints received.  
Finally, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005
(PSQIA)[79](ONCs.html#187)provides for  
privilege and confidentiality protections for information that meets the
definition of patient  
  
79 Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005, 42 U.S.C. 299b-21
– b-26 (P.L.109-41).

safety work product (PSWP). This means that PSWP may only be disclosed
as permitted by the  
PSQIA and its implementing regulations. We clarify that to the extent
activities are conducted in  
accordance with the PSQIA, its implementing regulation, and section
4005(c) of the Cures Act,  
no such activities shall be construed as constituting restrictions or
prohibitions that contravene  
this Condition of Certification.  
We understand that the nature of the information about health IT that
would ordinarily be  
disclosed by a health care provider when reporting an adverse event,
hazard, or unsafe conditions  
to government agencies, health care accreditation organizations, and
patient safety organizations,  
would not ordinarily contain intellectual property or trade secrets.
Notwithstanding this, in light  
of the public policy interest and established reporting mechanisms
described above, we do not  
consider the potential inclusion of intellectual property or trade
secrets in the communication  
should prohibit or restrict a health care provider from making a
complete and timely report. For  
example, proposed § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(D) permits developers to impose
certain restrictions on  
the general publication of screenshots, but we do not consider that such
restrictions should be  
permitted when the communication is made for one of the purposes, and to
one of the recipients,  
identified in § 170.403(a)(2)(i)(B).  
  
We seek comment on whether the unqualified protection afforded to
communications  
made to a patient safety organizations about adverse events, hazards,
and other unsafe conditions  
should be limited. Specifically, we seek comment on whether the
unqualified protection should  
be limited by the nature of the patient safety organization to which a
communication can be  
made, or the nature of the communication that can made—such as limiting
to only material that  
was created as PSWP.

*(C)* *Communicating Information About Cybersecurity Threats and*  
*Incidents to Government Agencies*  
  
We propose that if health IT developers were to impose prohibitions or
restrictions on the  
ability of any person or entity to communicate information about **
cybersecurity threats and  
incidents to government agencies, such conduct would not comply with
this Condition of  
Certification. Government agencies such as the United States Computer
Emergency Readiness  
Team (US-CERT) respond to and protect both the government and private
industry from cyber  
threats. Their work helps protect the entire health care system from
cybersecurity threats and  
relies on the timely reporting of security issues and vulnerabilities by
health care providers and  
health IT users. These agencies impose appropriate controls on
information they receive, which  
mitigates any risk that developers may feel arises from the disclosure
of information about their  
health IT. The US-CERT, for example, provides secure forms for such
reporting, and we are  
confident that reporting security incident information to US-CERT and
other government  
agencies would be unlikely to pose any threat to health IT developer
intellectual property or  
trade secrets. Additionally, the information likely reported regarding
such an incident would  
generally not reveal trade secrets. Where circumstances may require
collection of more sensitive  
and confidential information related to a developer’s intellectual
property, we believe that  
appropriate protections would likely apply and that the public benefit
of thoroughly investigating  
and addressing cybersecurity issues outweighs any potential harm.  
  
Communications about security issues related to health IT may alert
nefarious individuals  
or entities to the existence of a security vulnerability which could be
exploited before a  
developer has time to fix the vulnerability. However, we propose that
this concern must be

balanced against the imperative of ensuring that health IT customers are
aware of security  
vulnerabilities so that they can respond by deploying reactive measures
independent of the  
developer, such as ceasing health information exchange with a
compromised system. We seek  
comment on whether it would be reasonable to permit health IT developers
to impose limited  
restrictions on communications about security issues so as to safeguard
the confidentiality,  
integrity, and security of eHI. For example, should health IT developers
be permitted to require  
that health IT users notify the developer about the existence of a
security vulnerability prior to,  
or simultaneously with, any communication about the issue to a
government agency? ****  
*(D)* **** *Communicating Information About Information Blocking and*  
*Other Unlawful Practices to a Government Agency* ****  
  
As in the circumstances described above, we believe that the public
benefit associated  
with the communication of information to government agencies on
information blocking, or any  
other unlawful practice, outweighs any concerns developers might have
about the disclosure of  
information about their health IT. We believe that reporting information
blocking, as well as  
other unlawful practices, to a government agency would not cause an
undue threat to a health IT  
developer’s intellectual property or trade secrets. Generally speaking,
agencies collecting reports  
would protect all information received and keep it confidential to the
extent permitted by law.  
*(E)* *Communicating Information About a Health IT Developer’s*  
*Failure to Comply with a Condition of Certification or Other*  
*Program Requirement*  
  
We propose that the benefits to the public and to users of health IT of
communicating  
information about a health IT developer’s failure to comply with a

other Program requirement (45 CFR part 170) justify prohibiting
developers of health IT from  
placing any restrictions on such protected communications. Information
regarding the failure of a  
health IT product to meet any Condition of Certification or other
Program requirement is vital to  
the effective performance and integrity of the Program, which certifies
that health IT functions  
consistent with its certification. While the current procedures for
reporting issues with certified  
health IT encourage providers to contact developers in the first
instance to address certification  
issues, users of health IT should not hesitate to contact ONC-Authorized
Certification Bodies  
(ONC-ACBs), or ONC itself, if the developer does not provide an
appropriate response, or the  
matter is of a nature that should be immediately reported to an ONC-ACB
or to ONC. ****  
v. Permitted Prohibitions and Restrictions **  
  
We propose that, *except for communications with unqualified protection
discussed above*  
*and enumerated in § 170.403(a)(2)(i)*, health IT developers would be
permitted to impose certain  
narrow kinds of prohibitions and restrictions discussed below and
specified in §  
170.403(a)(2)(ii). We believe this policy strikes a reasonable balance
between the need to  
promote open communication about health IT and related business
practices and the need to  
protect the legitimate interests of health IT developers and other
entities. Specifically, with the  
exception of communications with unqualified protection, developers
would be permitted to  
prohibit or restrict the following communications, subject to certain
conditions:  
• Communications of their own employees;  
• Disclosure of non-user-facing aspects of the software;  
• Certain communications that would infringe the developer’s or another
person’s intellectual  
property rights;

• Publication of screenshots in very narrow circumstances; and  
• Communications of information that a person or entity knows only
because of their  
participation in developer-led product development and testing.  
  
As discussed in detail in the sections that follow, the proposed
Condition of Certification  
carefully delineates the circumstances under which these types of
prohibitions and restrictions  
would be permitted, including certain associated conditions that
developers would be required to  
meet. To be clear, any prohibition or restriction not expressly
permitted would violate the  
Condition. Additionally, it would be the developer’s burden to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of  
ONC that the developer has met all associated requirements. Further, as
an additional safeguard,  
we propose that where a developer seeks to avail itself of one of the
permitted types of  
prohibitions or restrictions, the developer must ensure that potential
communicators are clearly  
and explicitly notified about the information and material that can be
communicated, and that  
which cannot. We propose this would mean that the language of health IT
contracts must be  
precise and specific. Contractual provisions or public statements that
support a permitted  
prohibition or restriction on communication should be very specific
about the rights and  
obligations of the potential communicator. Contract terms that are vague
and cannot be readily  
understood by a reasonable health IT customer will not benefit from the
qualifications to this  
Condition of Certification outlined below. ****

*(A)* **** *Developer employees and contractors* ****  
  
We recognize that health IT developer employees, together with the
entities and  
individuals who are contracted by health IT developers to deliver
products and/or services (such  
as consultants), may be exposed to highly sensitive, proprietary, and
valuable information in the

course of performing their duties. We also recognize that the proper
functioning of a workforce  
depends, at least in part, on the ability of an employer to regulate how
and when the organization  
communicates information to the public, and that employees owe
confidentiality obligations to  
their employers. We propose that on this basis, developers are permitted
to impose prohibitions  
or restrictions on the communications of employees and contractors to
the extent that those  
communications fall outside of the class of communications with
unqualified protection as  
discussed above.  
  
  
  
  
*(B) Non-user-facing aspects of health IT*  
  
The purpose of this Condition of Certification is to ensure that health
IT users and other  
potential communicators are not restrained in their ability to
communicate—publicly or  
privately—about certain protected subject areas. We propose that this
purpose can generally be  
achieved without communicators disclosing information about those parts
of health IT that are  
legally protected trade secrets. As such, we propose this Condition of
Certification will permit  
health IT developers to impose prohibitions and restrictions on
communications that are not  
communications with unqualified protection to the extent necessary to
ensure that  
communications do not disclose “non-user-facing aspects of health IT.”  
  
A “non-user-facing aspect of health IT” is, for the purpose of this
Condition of  
Certification, an aspect of health IT that is not a “user-facing aspect
of health IT.” A “user-facing  
aspect of health IT” means those aspects of health IT that that are
disclosed and evident to  
anyone running, using, or observing the operation of health IT. That is,
a user-facing aspect of  
health IT comprises those aspects of the health IT that are manifest in
how the health IT software  
works. User-facing aspects of health IT include the design concepts and
functionality that is

<span id="194"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **194** of **724**  
  
readily ascertainable from the health IT’s user interface and screen
display. They do not include  
those parts of the health IT that are not exposed to persons running,
using, or observing the  
operation of the health IT. We propose that non-user-facing aspects of
health IT would include  
source and object code, software documentation, design specifications,
flowcharts, and file and  
data formats. We welcome comments on whether these and other aspects of
health IT should be  
treated as not being user-facing.  
For clarity, we note that the terminology of “user-facing aspects of
health IT” is not  
intended to afford only health IT users with specific protections
against developer prohibitions or  
restrictions on communications. Rather, the terminology is agnostic as
to the identity of the  
communicator and is instead focused on describing those aspects of
health IT that are readily  
ascertainable from the health IT’s user interface and screen display.
Numerous other potential  
communicators will also be exposed to “user-facing aspects of health
IT,” such as third-party  
contractors, health information exchange organizations, recipients of a
software demonstration,  
and trade groups or researchers that observe the operation of health IT
in the field.  
We propose that this approach reasonably implements the Cures Act,
which, in direct  
response to strict confidentiality obligations, broad intellectual
property clauses, and non-  
disclosure provisions in EHR contracts, identified a list of protected
subject areas for disclosure  
(enumerated at section 3001(c)(5)(D)(iii) of the PHSA) that largely
targeted the aspects of health  
IT that are apparent to, and known by, individuals and entities that use
or interact with health IT.  
We propose that if a health IT user were prohibited from describing the
user-facing aspects of  
their health IT product, they could not sensibly communicate useful
information about the  
usability or interoperability of the product, or their experiences as a
health IT user. These subject

areas are fundamentally tied to the way that the health IT product
works, its design, and its  
functionality.  
  
Protecting the communication of “user-facing aspects of health IT” is
also consistent with  
the treatment of software products under trade secret law, where the
public-facing aspects of  
software products are not generally considered secret because they are
evident to anyone running  
the software program. Moreover, this approach is appropriate given the
manner in which health  
IT is deployed and used by health IT customers. Unlike software products
that are deployed and  
used in a cloistered setting where access to the software is highly
restricted, health IT is typically  
deployed in a setting in which the operation of the health IT can be
readily observed by a wide  
range of persons. Health IT used in a physician’s consulting room can be
observed by the patient.  
Health IT deployed in a hospital can be observed by numerous individuals
in addition to those  
who are “authorized users” of the health IT system, including, for
example, the patient, the  
patient’s family, volunteer staff, law enforcement, and clergy. As such,
because health IT is of a  
nature that license terms or nondisclosure obligations do not act as a
genuine control over the  
disclosure of those aspects of the software that are “user-facing,”
communications about such  
aspects should be afforded protection from developer prohibitions and
restrictions under this  
proposed Condition of Certification.  
  
  
  
  
*(C) Intellectual Property*  
  
Many aspects of health IT—including software and documentation—will
contain  
intellectual property that belongs to the health IT developer (or a
third party) and is protected by  
law. Health IT products may have portions in which copyrighted works
exist, or that are subject  
to patent protection. As in other technology sectors, health IT
developers place a high value on

their intellectual property and go to significant lengths to protect it,
including intellectual  
property provisions in their health IT contracts.  
  
This Condition of Certification is not intended to operate as a *de
facto* license for health  
IT users and others to act in any way that might infringe the legitimate
intellectual property  
rights of developers. Indeed, we propose that health IT developers are
permitted to prohibit or  
restrict communications that would infringe their intellectual property
rights so long as the  
communication in question is not a communication with unqualified
protection. However, any  
prohibition and restriction imposed by a developer must be no broader
than legally permissible  
and reasonably necessary to protect the developer’s legitimate
intellectual property interests. We  
are aware that some health IT contracts contain broad intellectual
property provisions (and  
related terms, such as nondisclosure provisions) that purport to prevent
health IT customers and  
users from using copyright material in ways that are lawful. On this
basis, while we are  
providing an exception for the protection of intellectual property
interests, we want to clarify that  
under this Condition of Certification health IT developers are not
permitted to prohibit or restrict,  
or purport to prohibit or restrict, communications that would be a “fair
use” of any copyright  
work comprised in the developer’s health IT. That is, a developer is not
permitted to prohibit or  
restrict communications under the guise of copyright protection (or
under the guise of a  
confidentiality or non-disclosure obligation) when the communication in
question makes a use of  
the copyright material in a way that would qualify that use as a “fair
use.”[80](ONCs.html#196)  
We welcome comments on whether an appropriate balance has been struck
between  
protecting legitimate intellectual property rights of developers and
ensuring that health IT

customers, users, researchers, and other stakeholders who use and work
with health IT can  
openly discuss and share their experiences and other relevant
information about the performance  
of health IT.  
  
  
  
  
*(D)* *Faithful Reproductions of Health IT Screenshots*  
  
We propose that health IT developers generally would not be permitted to
prohibit or  
restrict communications that disclose screenshots of the developer’s
health IT. We consider  
screen displays an essential component of health IT performance and
usability, and their  
reproduction may be necessary in order for a health IT user or other
health IT stakeholder to  
properly make communications about the subject matters enumerated in §
170.403(a)(1). We  
acknowledge that some health IT developers have historically and
aggressively sought to  
prohibit the disclosure of such communications. We consider that
developers may benefit from  
screen displays being faithfully reproduced so that health IT users and
other stakeholders can  
form an objective opinion on any question raised about usability in
communications protected by  
this proposed Condition of Certification. Moreover, we consider that the
reproduction of  
screenshots in connection with the making of a communication protected
by this Condition of  
Certification would ordinarily represent a “fair use” of any copyright
subsisting in the screen  
display, and developers should not impose prohibitions or restrictions
that would limit that fair  
use.  
Notwithstanding the above, we propose to permit certain prohibitions and
restrictions on  
the communication of screenshots. Except in connection with
communications with unqualified  
protection, developers would be permitted to impose certain restrictions
on the disclosure of  
screenshots, as described below.

Federal Register (OFR) for publication and  
has not yet been placed on public display or published in the Federal

-----

<span id="198"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **198** of **724**  
  
In order to ensure that disclosures of screenshots are reasonable and
represent a faithful  
reproduction of the developer’s screen design and health IT, we propose
that developers would  
be permitted to prevent communicators from altering screenshots, other
than to annotate the  
screenshot or to resize it for the purpose of publication. We consider
this a reasonable limitation  
on the disclosure of screenshots and one that would help developers’
health IT avoid being  
misrepresented by communicators seeking to make a communication
protected by this proposed  
Condition of Certification.  
  
We also propose that health IT developers could impose restrictions on
the disclosure of a  
screenshot on the basis that it would infringe third-party intellectual
property rights (on their  
behalf or as required by license). However, to take advantage of this
exception, the developer  
would need to first put all potential communicators on sufficient
written notice of those parts of  
the screen display that contain trade secrets or intellectual property
rights and cannot be  
communicated, and would still need to allow communicators to communicate
redacted versions  
of screenshots that do not reproduce those parts.  
Finally, we also recognize that health IT developers may have
obligations under HIPAA  
as a business associate and that it would be reasonable for developers
to impose restrictions on  
the communication of screenshots that contain protected health
information, provided that  
developers permit the communication of screenshots that have been
redacted to conceal  
protected health information, or the relevant individual’s consent or
authorization had been  
obtained.  
  
  
  
  
*(E) Testing and development*

has not yet been placed on public display or published in the Federal

<span id="199"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **199** of **724**  
  
  
We are aware that some health IT developers expose aspects of their
health IT to health  
care providers and others for the purpose of testing and development
prior to a product’s  
“general availability” release. Such disclosures may relate to beta
releases that are shared with  
certain customers for testing prior to the software being made generally
available to the market,  
or may be made as part of a joint-venture or cooperative development
process. In these  
circumstances, we propose that a health IT developer would be justified
in keeping information  
about its health IT confidential, and we do not intend that the
protection afforded to  
communicators under this Condition of Certification would allow
disclosures of this information.  
This permitted prohibition or restriction would allow developers to seek
appropriate intellectual  
property protection and freely discuss novel, “unreleased” product
features with their customer  
base, which has significant public policy benefits for research and
innovation in the health IT  
industry.  
  
As with the other allowable restrictions listed above, we propose that
this permitted  
restriction would be limited and does not apply to communications which
are communications  
with unqualified protection as described above and specified in §
170.403(a)(2)(i). For example,  
information that is learned as part of development and testing, such as
the hard-coding of test  
procedure processes that raise serious patient safety concerns, could be
communicated for one of  
the limited purposes specified in § 170.403(a)(2)(i) if the software is
certified or released to  
market. We propose that this permitted restriction would also not apply
to communications about  
the released version of the health IT once the health IT has been
released to market or has been  
certified, provided that the communications otherwise meet all other
requirements to be afforded

protection under this Condition of Certification and the information
communicated could be  
discovered by any ordinary user of the health IT.  
  
For example, a health IT developer and a large health system enter into
an agreement for  
members of the health IT developer’s engineering team to work with
members of the health  
system’s clinical team to develop a customization for the system’s use
of the developer’s EHR.  
In order to properly protect any intellectual property rights, or
proprietary information, arising  
from this work, the developer and health system enter into a contract
which imposes on the  
system and affected members of its clinical team strict nondisclosure
related to testing and  
development of the health IT. This would be reasonable and would not
contravene this Condition  
of Certification, provided that: 1) the nondisclosure obligations were
narrowly targeted toward  
the work product associated with the testing and development; and 2) the
obligations ceased  
immediately upon any resultant software being deployed in the health
system, to the extent that  
the information fell within one of the subject areas enumerated in §
170.403(a)(1) and would be  
apparent to an ordinary user of the health IT. ￼  
  
To ensure that this permitted prohibition/restriction is not abused,
such as by maintaining  
a product in beta release for an indefinite or lengthy period of time,
we request comment on  
whether we should limit the time this protection would apply for testing
purposes. This could be  
no longer than a year after release of a product or update. We also
request comment on whether  
we should set specific parameters for covered testing. For example, we
note above our  
expectations that a product would be shared with *certain* customers for
testing prior to the  
software being made *generally available* to the market. As such, for

prohibition/restriction to apply, should we more specifically limit the
extent a product can be  
distributed to customers for testing purposes?  
  
  
c. Maintenance of Certification Requirements  
  
We propose that to maintain compliance with this Condition of
Certification a health IT  
developer must not establish or enforce any contract or agreement
provision that contravenes this  
Condition of Certification. We are aware that some developers currently
have in place health IT  
contracts that contain provisions that contravene this proposed
Condition of Certification  
because they impose impermissible prohibitions or restrictions on
communications. In some  
instances, the provisions in question will be expressly at odds with
this Condition, imposing  
obligations on health IT customers, or creating rights in favor of the
developer, that prohibit or  
restrict communications that are protected. In other instances, a
contract will include a provision  
that contravenes this Condition because it has been drawn in such broad
terms—such as an  
overly-expansive definition of confidential information—that a
reasonable reader of the  
provision would consider the making of a communication protected by this
Condition a breach of  
the contract.  
  
Health IT contracts are typically for a significant duration—e.g., 5
years or more—or  
include an automatic renewal whereby the then current terms roll over
for any renewal period.  
The implementation of this proposed Condition of Certification cannot
therefore wait until health  
IT contracts that contravene this Condition expire in the ordinary
course. As such, we are  
requiring that health IT developers take immediate steps to become in
compliance with this  
Condition of Certification.

<span id="202"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **202** of **724**  
  
  
We propose that a health IT developer must notify all customers and
those with which it  
has contracts/agreements, within six months of the effective date of a
subsequent final rule for  
this proposed rule, that any communication or contract/agreement
provision that contravenes this  
Condition of Certification will not be enforced by the health IT
developer. Further, we propose  
that this notice would need to be provided annually up to and until the
health IT developer  
amends the contract or agreement to remove or make void any contractual
provision that  
contravenes this Condition of Certification. We further propose as a
Maintenance of Certification  
requirement in § 170.405(b)(2) that health IT developers must amend
their contracts or  
agreements to remove or make void any provisions that contravene the
Condition of Certification  
within a reasonable period of time, but not later than two years from
the effective date of a  
subsequent final rule for this proposed rule.  
We believe this is an appropriate approach as we understand that health
IT developers are  
in regular contact with their customers, and so the provision of a
notice that satisfies this  
requirement should not present an undue burden for a developer. We would
also expect that  
developers have kept good records of nondisclosure agreements that they
have entered into with  
other organizations or individuals, such as third-party developers, and
can communicate with  
those organizations or individuals as necessary to satisfy this
requirement. In the event that a  
health IT developer cannot, despite all reasonable efforts, locate an
entity or individual that  
previously entered into an agreement with the developer that prohibits
or restricts  
communications protected by this Condition, the developer would not be
in contravention of this  
Condition so long as it takes no step to enforce the prohibition or
restriction. For clarity, we do  
not propose that health IT developers be required to furnish to ONC or
their ONC-ACB copies of

notices made to customers, or copies of contracts or agreements revised,
in satisfaction of this  
Maintenance of Certification requirement, although those communications
may be requested by  
ONC or an ONC-ACB in the usual course of business. To this point, under
the “Enforcement”  
section of this proposed rule (VII.D), we describe our general
enforcement approach outlining a  
corrective action process for ONC to review instances where Conditions
and Maintenance of  
Certification requirements are not being met by a health IT developer
under the Program.  
  
We note that another approach we considered proposing would have been to
require that  
developers amend their current health IT contracts immediately. We have,
however, relied on the  
proposed requirement that developers not enforce contractual terms that
contravene this  
proposed Condition of Certification until they can amend their contracts
in a reasonable period of  
time, but not later than two years from the effective date of a
subsequent final rule for this  
proposed rule. We seek comment on whether this is an adequate approach
to removing  
prohibitions and restrictions on protected communications and ensuring
that health IT customers,  
users, researchers, and other stakeholders are aware of their right to
engage in such  
communications notwithstanding existing contracts or agreements to the
contrary.  
4\. Application Programming Interfaces  
As a Condition of Certification (and Maintenance thereof) under the
Program, the **** Cures  
Act requires health IT developers to publish APIs that allow “health
information from such  
technology to be accessed, exchanged, and used without special effort
through the use of APIs or  
successor technology or standards, as provided for under applicable
law.” The Cures Act’s API  
Condition of Certification also states that a developer must, through an
API, “provide access to

all data elements of a patient’s electronic health record to the extent
permissible under applicable  
privacy laws.”  
  
The Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification includes several key
phrases and  
requirements for health IT developers that go beyond just the technical
functionality of the  
products they present for certification. In this section of the preamble
we outline our proposals to  
implement the Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification in order to
provide compliance clarity  
for health IT developers.  
These proposals include new standards, new implementation
specifications, and a new  
certification criterion as well as detailed Conditions and Maintenance
of Certification  
requirements. We also propose to modify the Base EHR definition. We note
that health IT  
developers should also consider these proposals in the context of what
could warrant review  
from an information blocking perspective in so far as action (or
inaction) that would be  
inconsistent with this proposed rule’s API Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification  
requirements.  
  
  
a. Statutory Interpretation and API Policy Principles  
  
One of the most significant phrases in the Cures Act’s API Condition of
Certification  
concerns the deployment and use of APIs “without special effort.”
Specifically, the Cures Act  
requires health IT developers to publish APIs and allow health
information from such technology  
“to be accessed, exchanged, and used without special effort.” In this
context, we interpret the  
“effort” exerted (i.e., by whom) to be focused on the API users, which
could include third-party  
software developers, the health care providers that acquired this API
technology, and patients,  
health care providers, and payers that use apps/services that connect to
API technology.

<span id="205"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **205** of **724**  
  
  
As we considered the meaning and context associated with the phrase
“without special  
effort” and what would make APIs included in certified health IT truly
“open,” we focused on  
key attributes that could be used to refine our interpretation and guide
our proposals. We  
interpret “without special effort” to require that APIs, and the health
care ecosystem in which  
they are deployed, have three attributes: *standardized*, *transparent*,
and *pro-competitive*. Each of  
these attributes is briefly described in more detail below and all of
our subsequent proposals  
address one or a combination of these attributes.  
• *Standardized* – meaning that all health IT developers seeking
certification would have to  
implement the same technical API capabilities in their products (using
modern, computing  
standards such as RESTful interfaces and XML/JSON). Technical
consistency and  
implementation predictability are fundamental to scale API-enabled
interoperability and  
reduce the level of custom development and costs necessary to access,
exchange, and use  
health information. Further, from a regulatory standpoint, health IT
developers would gain  
certainty in regards to pre-certification testing requirements and
post-certification “real world  
testing” expectations. Equally, from an industry standpoint, a
consistent and predictable set  
of API functions would provide the health IT ecosystem with known
technical requirements  
against which “app” developers and other innovative services can be
built.  
• *Transparent* – meaning that all health IT developers seeking
certification would need to  
make the specific business and technical documentation necessary to
interact with the APIs  
in production freely and publicly accessible. Such transparency and
openness is  
commonplace in many other industries and has fueled innovation, growth,
and competition.

• *Pro-competitive* – meaning that all health IT developers seeking
certification would need to  
abide by business practices that promote the efficient access, exchange,
and use of EHI to  
support a competitive marketplace that enhances consumer value and
choice. Moreover,  
health care providers should have the sole authority and autonomy to
unilaterally permit  
third-party software developers ** to connect to the API technology they
have acquired. In other  
words, health IT developers **must not** interfere with a health care
provider’s use of their  
acquired API technology in any way, especially ways that would impact
its equitable access  
and use based on (for example) another software developer’s size,
current client base, or  
business line. It also means that developers (together with health care
providers that deploy  
APIs) are accountable to patients who, as consumers of health care
services, have paid for  
their care and the information generated from such care. Thus, patients
should be able to  
access their EHI via any API-enabled app they choose without special
effort, including  
without incurring additional costs and without encountering access
requirements that impede  
their ability to access their information in a persistent manner.  
  
  
b. Key Terms  
To clearly convey the stakeholders on which our proposals focus and are
meant to  
support, we propose to use the following terms to reflect these meanings
and/or roles:  
• The term “*API technology*” (with a lowercase “t”) generally refers to
the capabilities of  
certified health IT that fulfill the API-focused certification criteria
adopted or proposed for  
adoption at 45 CFR 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(11).  
• “*API Technology Supplier*” refers to a health IT developer that
creates the API technology  
that is presented for testing and certification to any of the
certification criteria adopted or

proposed for adoption at 45 CFR 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(11). We
propose to adopt this  
term in § 170.102.  
• “*API Data Provider*” refers to the organization that deploys the API
technology created by  
the “API Technology Supplier” and provides access via the API technology
to data it  
produces and electronically manages. In some cases, the API Data
Provider may contract  
with the API Technology Supplier to perform the API deployment service
on its behalf.  
However, in such circumstances, the API Data Provider retains control of
what and how  
information is disclosed and so for the purposes of this definition is
considered to be the  
entity that deploys the API technology. We propose to adopt this term in
§ 170.102.  
• “*API User*” – refers to persons and entities that use or create
software applications that  
interact with the APIs developed by the “API Technology Supplier” and
deployed by the  
“API Data Provider.” An API User includes, but is not limited to,
third-party software  
developers, developers of software applications used by API Data
Providers, patients, health  
care providers, and payers that use apps/services that connect to API
technology. We propose  
to adopt this term in § 170.102.  
We also use:  
• The term “*(g)(10)-certified API*” for ease of reference throughout
the preamble to refer to  
health IT certified to the certification criterion proposed for adoption
in 45 CFR  
170.315(g)(10).  
• The term “*app*” for ease of reference to describe any type of
software application that would  
be designed to interact with the (g)(10)-certified APIs. This generic
term is meant to

include, but not be limited to, a range of applications from mobile and
browser-based to  
comprehensive business-to-business enterprise applications administered
by third parties.  
c. Proposed API Standards, Implementation Specifications, and
Certification  
Criterion  
APIs can be thought of as a set of commands, functions, protocols,
and/or tools published  
by one software developer (“software developer A”) that enable other
software developers (X, Y,  
and Z) to create programs and applications that interact with A’s
software without needing to  
know the “internal” workings of A’s software. APIs can facilitate more
seamless access to health  
information and it is important to note for context that ONC adopted
three 2015 Edition  
certification criteria that specified API capabilities for Health IT
Modules (criteria adopted in 45  
CFR 170.315(g)(7), (g)(8), and (g)(9)). The following sections detail
our proposals to adopt  
standards, implementation specifications, and a new API certification
criterion. Together, these  
proposals account for the technical requirements we propose to associate
with the Cures Act’s  
API Condition of Certification and are reinforced through the
condition’s policy proposals.  
  
  
  
i. Proposed Adoption of FHIR DSTU2 Standard  
  
Overall, and on balance, we have structured our standards and
implementation  
specifications proposals to best meet the health IT industry where it is
most prepared to comply  
today. As a result, we propose to adopt the HL7® Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources  
(FHIR®) standard as a foundational standard within our suite of
proposals. Specifically, we  
propose to adopt FHIR Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU) 2 (hereafter
referred to as “FHIR  
Release 2”) as a baseline standard conformance requirement. In so doing,
we can work with  
industry to support a conformance testing infrastructure for a full
suite of proposals focused on

one FHIR release (its associated implementation specifications) and
complementary security and  
app registration protocols, compared to numerous
versions.[81](ONCs.html#209)  
The 2015 Edition final rule did not include specific standards or
implementation  
specifications to describe the way in which APIs needed to be designed
to meet § 170.315(g)(8).  
Instead, we specified a functional certification criterion and
encouraged the industry to coalesce  
around a standardized specification for its API functionality, such as
the FHIR standard. We did,  
however, require health IT developers to make their technical API
documentation publicly  
available and we subsequently made such information accessible via the
CHPL.  
Upon reviewing health IT developers certified to § 170.315(g)(8),
approximately 32%  
have published via the CHPL that they are using FHIR, specifically FHIR
Release 2, as of mid-  
September 2018. Additionally, nearly 51% of health IT developers appear
to be using a version  
of FHIR and OAuth 2.0 together. We also note that when viewed from the
perspective of how  
many providers are served by these FHIR implementers, we estimate that
approximate 87% of  
hospitals and 57% of clinicians are served by developers with a FHIR
Release 2 API and 87% of  
hospitals and 69% of clinicians are served by developers with a FHIR API
of any version. In the  
years since the 2015 Edition final rule, industry stakeholders have made
rapid progress to  
advance the FHIR standard. This includes substantial investments in
industry pilots, specification  
development led through the Argonaut Project[82](ONCs.html#209)
production deployment of APIs conformant to  
FHIR Release 2 following the Argonaut specifications, and the support
for FHIR Release 2 in  
Apple’s iOS 11.3, which includes a new “health records” app for the
iPhone based on these

<span id="210"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **210** of **724**  
  
specifications.[83](ONCs.html#210) Therefore, the industry is well
prepared and ready to adopt the FHIR standard.  
Thus, we propose to adopt FHIR Release 2 as the baseline standard in a
new API standards  
section of our rules at 45 CFR 170.215(a)(1). Additionally, as discussed
in further detail below,  
we reference FHIR Release 2 for use in the new API certification
criterion proposed for adoption  
in § 170.315(g)(10).  
  
Although FHIR Release 3 is published and some health IT developers have
included  
varied support for it in their product(s) at this time, there is limited
evidence that its production  
deployment is as widespread as FHIR Release 2. Thus, we believe that
FHIR Release 2 is the  
most appropriate version to propose to adopt as part of proposed §
170.315(g)(10)’s  
conformance requirements. This approach would provide a stable and
consistent direction in  
which the industry can go when it comes to deploying (g)(10)-certified
APIs that support data  
access to the USCDI. FHIR Release 2 best reflects the industry’s current
maturity and  
implementation readiness, it has been more rigorously tested, and it is
largely implemented in  
most 2015 Edition health IT systems that have and are being deployed in
production. Thus, the  
incremental burden for many health IT developers to get certified to the
proposed criterion in §  
170.315(g)(10) would be largely limited to the added security and
registration conformance  
requirements we have proposed to include. We recognize, however, that
some health IT  
developers certified to § 170.315(g)(8) chose not to use FHIR and will
have more substantial  
changes to make in order to meet this
proposal.

Additionally, FHIR Release 4 has now been published[84](ONCs.html#211)
and updated associated  
implementation specifications are expected to follow. FHIR Release 4 has
several key  
improvements, including certain foundational aspects in the standard and
“FHIR resources”  
designated as “normative” for the first time. This will lead to acycle
of more mature US FHIR  
Core profiles aligned with Release 4 and additional implementation
guidance that explicitly  
specifies how to handle populations of patient data (batch exports) via
FHIR to more efficiently  
enable population and learning health system-oriented services.
Likewise, from an industry  
update trajectory, we believe that FHIR Release 4’s normative resources
will be compelling from  
a maturity and stability perspective such that many health IT developers
will either rapidly  
progress to FHIR Release 4 from Release 3 or skip wide-scale production
deployment of FHIR  
Release 3 altogether, making FHIR Release 4 the next de facto version
the industry would move  
toward and coalesce behind.  
Given FHIR Release 4’s public release and that the industry will begin
to implement  
Release 4 in parallel with this rulemaking, we request comment on the
following options we  
could pursue for a final rule.  
*Option 1 (proposed in regulation text)*: Adopt just FHIR Release 2 for
reference in  
proposed § 170.315(g)(10). This option would require health IT
developers seeking certification  
to build, test, and certify systems solely to FHIR Release 2 and its
associated implementation  
specifications. Under this option, if the National Coordinator approved
the use of FHIR Release  
3 or 4 (pursuant to the Standards Version Advancement Process) it would
occur, at the earliest,  
one year after a final rule was issued. Given that timing, and the
compliance deadlines proposed

later in this section, it would mean that health IT developers would
have no option but to develop  
to FHIR Release 2 in order to meet the proposed compliance deadlines.  
*Option 2:* Adopt FHIR Release 2 and FHIR Release 3 in order to
introduce optionality  
into how health IT developers are able to demonstrate compliance with
proposed §  
170.315(g)(10). In other words, by adopting and referencing both FHIR
Release 2 and 3 in  
proposed § 170.315(g)(10) it would permit a health IT developer to use
either one to meet the  
criterion (i.e., both versions would not be required to be supported and
demonstrating only one  
would be needed to meet certification). Similarly, under this option, if
the National Coordinator  
approved the use of FHIR Release 4 (pursuant to the Standards Version
Advancement Process) it  
would occur, at the earliest, one year after a final rule was issued.
Given that timing, and the  
compliance deadlines proposed later in this section, it would mean that
health IT developers  
would have no option but to develop to FHIR Release 2 or Release 3 in
order to meet the  
proposed compliance deadlines.  
*Option 3:* Adopt FHIR Release 2 and FHIR Release 4 in order to
introduce flexibility  
into how health IT developers are able to demonstrate compliance with
proposed §  
170.315(g)(10). The full implementation of this option would depend on
all applicable  
corresponding FHIR Release 2 implementation specifications also being
published in their FHIR  
Release 4 formats and available prior to the issuance of a final rule.
Provided these FHIR  
Release 4 implementation specifications are published in time for a
final rule, this option would  
appear to be the best near- and long-term option for the industry. We
anticipate this being the  
case because it would let lagging health IT developers catch up to the
FHIR Release 2 baseline  
while at the same time enable leading health IT developers to move
directly and immediately to

FHIR Release 4 as a means to meet proposed § 170.315(g)(10)’s compliance
timelines. In other  
words, unlike Options 1 and 2, the Standards Version Advancement Process
would not be  
necessary and the trajectory of leading health IT developers would be
well supported by the  
certification criterion. We also request comment on a variant of Option
3 that would include a  
pre-defined cut-over for the permitted use of and certification to FHIR
Release 2. We note that if  
this variant were implemented as part of Option 3, we would likely also
need to add a  
maintenance of certification requirement in the final rule to establish
an upgrade timeline to  
FHIR Release 4 for those health IT developers who originally sought
certification for FHIR  
Release 2. Such a maintenance requirement would seem necessary in order
to bring the industry  
into closer alignment with respect to a more up-to-date national
baseline for FHIR.  
*Option 4:* Adopt solely FHIR Release 4 in the final rule for reference
in proposed §  
170.315(g)(10). This option would require health IT developers seeking
certification to build,  
test, and certify systems solely to FHIR Release 4 and its associated
implementation  
specifications. Again, provided all applicable FHIR Release 4
implementation specifications are  
published in time for a final rule, this option would appear to be a
close preference to Option 3  
for industry. We believe this would be the case because by the time a
final rule associated with  
these proposals is issued, it is likely that health IT developers would
have close to or over a  
year’s worth of development experience with FHIR Release 4. As a result,
many may be poised  
to introduce their first round of generally available FHIR Release 4
products into production. If  
ONC were to offer certification to FHIR Release 2 (as in Option 3) this
flexibility could  
unintentionally delay the industry’s transition to FHIR Release 4 and
slow progress associated  
with FHIR-based interoperability. The following compliance timeline
example attempts to make

this point clearer. If, for example, the final rule was effective
January 2020, based on other  
proposals associated with the API Conditions of Certification, health IT
developers would have  
up to 2 years to rollout their (g)(10)-certified API technology, which
would mean January 2022.  
At that point, FHIR Release 4 would have been published for nearly 3
years and FHIR Release 2  
would have been published for nearly 6 years. Without a pre-defined
cut-over for FHIR Release  
2 in Option 3, that certification approach would permit FHIR Release 2
APIs to be deployed in  
2022 and used for an indeterminate period of time.  
In preparing your comments, please fully review our proposed
certification criterion in §  
170.315(g)(10) and the accompanying Conditions of Certification
attributed to the API-oriented  
certification criteria. Notably, if we were to adopt another FHIR
Release in a final rule as an  
alternative to FHIR Release 2 for the proposed API criterion in §
170.315(g)(10), then we would  
also adopt the applicable implementation specifications and FHIR
profiles (the US FHIR Core  
profiles) associated with the FHIR Release in order to support USCDI
data access. We highly  
encourage stakeholders to express their perspective and explicitly note
their preferred option in  
comments.  
ii. Proposed Adoption of Associated FHIR Release 2 Implementation  
Specifications  
Our proposal to adopt the FHIR standard alone, however, is insufficient
to provide the  
level of consistent implementation that will be necessary to realize the
“without special effort”  
provision in this Condition of Certification. FHIR, much like other
standards that are initially  
developed to be internationally applicable, requires additional
implementation specifications in  
order to further constrain implementation choices and reflect US-based
standards policies (such

as the use of RxNorm for representing medications). In FHIR, the
additional constraints placed  
on “base FHIR resources” are expressed through what are called “FHIR
profiles.” FHIR Profiles  
typically provide additional rules about which resource elements must be
used and what  
additional elements have been added that are not part of the base FHIR
resource. This can  
include, but not be limited to, rules about which API features are used
and how as well as rules  
about which terminologies are used in particular elements. The term
“profile” is a general term  
that is used in the FHIR standard to describe either an individual FHIR
resource, or an entire  
implementation specification consisting of multiple FHIR resources.
Accordingly, we propose to  
adopt three implementation specifications that will establish a
standardized baseline and further  
constrain API conformance to help assure that APIs can be used “without
special effort.”  
We propose to adopt in § 170.215(a)(2) an implementation specification
that would list a  
set of base FHIR resources that Health IT Modules certified to the
proposed criterion in §  
170.315(g)(10) would need to support. We refer to this proposed initial
set of FHIR resources as  
the “API Resource Collection in Health” or “the ARCH.” The ARCH would
align with and be  
directed by the data policy specified in the proposed US Core Data for
Interoperability (USCDI)  
standard (discussed in section IV.B.1 of this proposed rule).  
As a result, we propose to include 15 FHIR resources in the ARCH’s first
version. Based  
on prior industry efforts, including the Argonaut Project to map FHIR
resources to the previously  
defined Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), we know that the following 13
FHIR resources map  
to and support the equivalent data classes specified in the USCDI:
AllergyIntolerance; CarePlan;  
Condition; Device; DiagnosticReport; Goal; Immunization; Medication;
MedicationOrder;  
MedicationStatement; Observation; Patient; and Procedure. We also
propose to include,

specifically for the Patient resource that the “Patient.address” and
“Patient.telecom” elements  
must be supported as part of the Patient resource. These elements are
neither required in the base  
FHIR resource or additional implementation specifications; however, they
are necessary to align  
with the USCDI’s data requirements. With respect to the Device resource,
we propose to require  
that the “Device.udi” element follow the human readable representation
of the unique device  
identifier (UDI) found in the recommendation, guidance, and conformance
requirements section  
of the “HL7 Version 3 Cross Paradigm Implementation Guide: Medical
Devices and Unique  
Device Identification (UDI) Pattern, Release 1,” a document hosted by
HL7.[85](ONCs.html#216) Developers  
would be held responsible only for the recommendation, guidance, and
conformance  
requirements for HL7 FHIR in the implementation guide and would not be
held responsible for  
other requirements in the implementation guide specific to other
standards, including  
requirements for HL7 Version 2 and HL7 Version 3. For clarity, these
proposed requirements are  
part of the ARCH Version 1 standard.  
In addition to these 13 FHIR resources, we have included two additional
FHIR resources:  
1\) the Provenance resource; and 2) the DocumentReference resource to
accommodate clinical  
notes. These additions would make for a total of 15 FHIR resources to
reflect the direction of the  
USCDI v1. With respect to clinical notes, we understand from our own
analysis and technical  
discussions within HL7 that the FHIR DocumentReference resource is best
capable of handling  
the exchange of clinical notes. Since the CCDS was defined over two
years ago, we have most  
frequently heard from provider stakeholders that access to “clinical
notes” is key, impactful, and  
highly desirable data that should be accessible via the C-CDAs they
exchange as well as
via

APIs. While we realize the industry may need to develop additional
implementation guidance to  
support clinical notes via FHIR, we believe that including FHIR
resources in ARCH Version 1  
directly addresses the steady requests we have received from providers
to include a focus on the  
access, exchange, and use of “clinical notes” as part of certification.
Thus, we propose to include  
the FHIR DocumentReference resource in the ARCH to support clinical
notes. We also clarify  
that the clinical note text included in this FHIR resource would need to
be represented in its  
“raw” text form. In other words, it would be unacceptable for the note
text to be converted to  
another file or format (e.g., .docx, PDF) when it is provided as part of
an API response. With  
respect to the Provenance resource, we believe its inclusion in the ARCH
is paramount to the  
long-term success and use of FHIR-based APIs. While C-CDA’s are often
critiqued due to their  
relative “length,” the C-CDA often represents the output of a clinical
event and includes relevant  
context. The same will not always be true in an API-context. This is due
to the fact that FHIR-  
based APIs make it significantly easier for apps to request specific
data (e.g., just a patient’s  
active medications). Thus, it is equally important over the long-term
that the industry not lose  
sight of the metadata (i.e., the who, what, when, where, why, and how)
behind the data that was  
created. As a result, we believe that this early stage of FHIR
deployment is the best time for the  
industry to build in support for the Provenance resource. Otherwise, if
we were to expand the  
ARCH in future years to include this FHIR resource, we estimate that the
developer burden and  
overall industry impact would be greater than building this support in
“from the start.”  
Specifically, and to remain consistent with the USCDI, we propose to
require that the  
“Provenance.recorded” (for the author’s time stamp) and
“Provenance.agent.actor” (for the  
author and author’s organization) elements be supported as part of the
Provenance resource.

Over time, and as the USCDI is expanded, we also expect to update this
implementation  
specification to expand the ARCH beyond these 15 FHIR resources.
Equally, consistent with the  
Maintenance of Certification requirements described in section VII.B.5
of this proposed rule (the  
Standards Version Advancement Process proposals), which would permit
health IT developers to  
voluntarily implement and use a new version of an adopted standard or
implementation  
specification so long as certain conditions are met including that the
new version is approved by  
the National Coordinator for use in certification through the Standards
Version Advancement  
Process, health IT developers would be able to update their certified
health IT to include (g)(10)-  
certified API access to a broader set of data once a new version of the
ARCH is approved.  
The next implementation specification for the FHIR standard we propose
to adopt in §  
170.215(a)(3) is the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide version 1
(Argonaut IG),  
hosted by HL7.[86](ONCs.html#218)This implementation guide has been
pilot tested and is now being implemented  
for production use by health IT developers. Notably, it specifies FHIR
profile constraints for 13  
of the associated FHIR resources we propose to include in the ARCH
Version 1 and these FHIR  
profiles support the data included in the USCDI (v1).  
The next implementation specification for the FHIR standard we propose
the Secretary  
adopt in § 170.215(a)(4) is the specific portion of the Argonaut IG that
refers to the “Argonaut  
Data Query Implementation Guide Server” conformance requirements. While
it could be implied  
through our proposed adoption of the Argonaut IG that these conformance
requirements would  
be included, we seek to make this an explicit requirement for the API
certification criterion  
proposed in § 170.315(g)(10). Conformance to this implementation
specification is essential in

order to ensure that all FHIR servers are consistently configured to
support the defined data  
queries and “supported searches” associated with each Argonaut profiled
FHIR resource. For  
clarity, conformance testing would focus on and be limited to the
“SHALL” requirements. We  
also note that the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide Server
includes conformance  
requirements for the “DocumentReference Profile,” which defines “how a
provider or patient can  
retrieve a patient’s existing clinical document.” This particular
specification was produced in  
support of the 2015 Edition certification criterion adopted in §
170.315(g)(9). As a result, we  
clarify that this specific portion of the Server IG and conformance
requirement would be out of  
scope for the purposes of proposed § 170.315(g)(10).  
  
We have separately proposed the FHIR standard and each of these
implementation  
specifications so that the National Coordinator may evaluate industry
progress and make a  
unique or combined determination as to the appropriate time to approve
for voluntary upgrade  
pursuant to the standards version advancement process discussed in more
detail in section  
VII.B.5 as well as subsequently go through rulemaking to adopt a new
version of: the FHIR  
standard, the ARCH, implementation specifications that “profile” the
resources in the ARCH,  
and implementation specifications for FHIR server conformance
capabilities. While the proposed  
implementation specifications relate to one another, they can also be
updated independently of  
each other as time goes on. For instance, the National Coordinator could
approve a new version  
of the FHIR standard “Release 5” in the future in accordance with the
standards version  
advancement process. In so doing, the National Coordinator could leave
the scope of the ARCH  
the same and update (necessarily) the implementation specifications for
the FHIR profiles and  
FHIR server conformance requirements accordingly to align with the new
FHIR version. As an

alternative example, the National Coordinator could leave the FHIR
standard version the same  
and approve a new version of the ARCH to include more FHIR resources.  
  
We note that other federal agencies may be adopting the FHIR standard
and additional  
FHIR implementation guides for their program requirements. We plan to
coordinate with such  
other agencies to focus on strategic alignment among the FHIR standard
versions, applicable  
implementation guides, and use cases.  
iii. Proposed Adoption of Standards and Implementation Specifications
to  
Support Persistent User Authentication and App Authorization  
To enable and support persistent user authentication and app
authorization processes, we  
propose to adopt a standards and additional implementation specification
for the FHIR standard.  
First, we propose to adopt the “OpenID Connect Core 1.0 incorporating
errata set 1” standard in  
§ 170.215(b) as it complements the SMART Application Launch Framework
Implementation  
Guide Release 1.0.0[87](ONCs.html#220) (SMART Guide). The OpenID
standard is typically paired with OAuth 2.0  
implementations and focuses on user authentication. Second, we propose
to adopt the SMART  
Guide ** in § 170.215(a)(5) as an additional implementation
specification associated with the FHIR  
standard. This guide is referenced by the Argonaut IG and is generally
being implemented by the  
health IT community as a security layer with which FHIR deployment is
being combined (from  
both a FHIR server and FHIR application perspective). Further, while the
SMART Guide  
includes certain mandatory requirements, we believe three specific
aspects are necessary to  
specifically require in order for certification to enable consistent
industry-wide implementation.

<span id="221"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **221** of **724**  
  
The SMART Guide specifies the use of “refresh tokens” as optional. We
believe that this  
requirement is necessary in order to enable persistent access by apps,
especially in a patient  
access context. Thus, we propose to make their use mandatory with a
minimum refresh token life  
of 3 months. While this technique would need to be supported for both
types of API-enabled  
services we propose be supported through § 170.315(g)(10), we wish to
emphasize that  
implementing refresh token support is directly intended to enable a
patient’s “persistent access”  
to their electronic health information without special effort (i.e.,
without having to frequently re-  
authenticate and re-authorize while using their preferred app). This
proposal aligns with the  
industry developed security best practice guidelines for OAuth 2.0
implementations, which  
require support for a short-lived “access token” and a long-lived
“refresh token” that could be  
subsequently used by the app to obtain a new “access token” after the
original “access token”  
expires. We believe this approach enhances the seamlessness of a
patient’s data access and  
reduces the “friction” they would otherwise experience having to
re-authenticate and re-  
authorize. At the same time, because the access token is short lived,
this minimizes the risk of a  
patient’s information being accessed by unauthorized users if for some
reason the access token is  
compromised. The technical capabilities that we intend to explicitly
test are referenced as part of  
the proposed API certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(10).  
We also propose to require that the “Standalone Launch” and “EHR
Launch”  
requirements specified in the SMART Guide be supported. We believe that
requiring API  
Technology Suppliers to demonstrate both of these capacities will help
ensure greater  
standardization and ease of use among (g)(10)-certified APIs. When a
third-party “app” first  
connects to a FHIR server, it often requires some contextual data to
make the app more “user

friendly.” This information could include things such as the most recent
patient encounter or  
hospital visit. The contextual information depends on how the “app” is
launched.  
When an app is launched from “outside of an EHR,” such as from a
patient’s smartphone  
or web browser, then the app is considered to be launched in a
“Standalone” mode. In this mode,  
the app has to request that the FHIR server provide appropriate
contextual information, which  
can then be used to customize the app’s display for the patient. The
SMART Guide has  
standardized the information that such apps can request from FHIR
servers and defined it as  
“Standalone Launch.”  
In other contexts, apps can be launched from “within the EHR.” This is
typically the case  
when a third-party app is integrated as part of an EHR technology. In
this case, the app is  
considered to have been launched in the “EHR” mode. Typically, when such
an app is launched  
from within an EHR, the user (e.g., provider, nurse) has a patient’s
record “open” or “active” in  
the EHR and expects the app to directly open the same patient when it is
launched. In order for  
this to happen, the app has to request that the FHIR server provides
information about the patient  
record that is currently “open” in the EHR. The SMART Guide has
standardized this interaction  
and defined it as “EHR Launch.”  
iv. Proposed Adoption of a New API Certification Criterion in §  
170.315(g)(10)  
**Proposal Overview**  
To implement the Cures Act, we propose to adopt a new criterion in §
170.315(g)(10) to  
replace the certification criterion adopted in § 170.315(g)(8).
Currently, the criterion adopted in §  
170.315(g)(8) focuses on a Health IT Module’s ability to provide API
functionality that can

respond with data for each of the data categories specified in the
Common Clinical Data Set.  
Moreover, its focus on read-access/response to requests for specific
types of data most directly  
aligns with the API uses envisioned by industry stakeholders and the
Cures Act, which is why  
we believe it is necessary and appropriate to replace § 170.315(g)(8).
In contrast, we do not  
propose that it is necessary to replace the certification criteria
adopted in § 170.315(g)(7) and  
(g)(9) because the former does not prescribe specific technical
approaches (and can continue to  
be met as technology evolves) and the latter supports a discrete use
case relative to an API  
function that responds with a C-CDA.  
  
We propose our approach to adopt a replacement for § 170.315(g)(8) that
will provide  
clear regulatory compliance requirements for stakeholders because: (1)
2015 Edition testing and  
certification to § 170.315(g)(8) will continue throughout this
rulemaking; (2) presuming we  
adopt this (or a modified version of this) proposal in a final rule, it
will be easier for the industry  
to distinguish compliance requirements between two separate
certification criteria compared to a  
time/context-sensitive “version” of § 170.315(g)(8); and (3) §
170.315(g)(8) is currently  
specified in the Base EHR definition so its replacement has compliance
effects on health care  
providers participating in **every** **program** that requires the use
of Certified EHR Technology,  
which references the Base EHR definition.  
At a high-level, we propose that this new API certification criterion
would require FHIR  
servers to support two types of API-enabled services:  
• services for which a single patient’s[88](ONCs.html#223) data is at
focus; and  
  
88 We recognize that individuals may not always be in an active role as
a “patient” when they use an application to  
access their data. However, we believe it is clearer for the purposes of
readability and policy intent to use the term  
“patient” as opposed to “individual.”

<span id="224"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **224** of **724**  
  
• services for which multiple patients’ data are at focus, which,
hereafter, we refer to as  
“population-level” to convey the grouped and cohort scope on which the
data associated with  
these services would be focused (e.g., a specific provider’s patient
panel, all of the patients  
covered by a particular health plan, a group of patients cared for
through an alternative  
payment model).  
This proposed certification criterion would only require mandatory
support for “read”  
access for both identified services, though we envision a future version
of this certification  
criterion that could include specific “write” conformance requirements
(for example, to aid  
decision support) once FHIR-based APIs are widely adopted. In all cases,
this proposed criterion  
will require that the two types of API services have appropriate
security controls implemented.  
These controls would ensure a user fully authenticates to the
API-enabled data source to which  
the request is being made and that the user’s software application is
appropriately authorized to  
request specified data.  
API services that focus on a single patient would include, but not be
limited to, those that  
interact with software applications controlled and used by a patient to
access their data as well as  
software applications implemented by a provider to enhance their own
“internal” clinical care  
tools and workflow (e.g., a specialized calculation app). Most, if not
all, of these types of  
interactions are typically orchestrated in a synchronous, real to
near-real-time mode via APIs.  
Conversely, API services that focus on multiple patients would include,
but not be  
limited to, software applications used by a health care provider to
manage various internal  
patient populations as well as external services a health care provider
may contract for to support  
quality improvement, population health management, and cost
accountability vis-à-vis the

provider’s partners (e.g., health plans). Historically, access to this
kind of computing has often  
been cumbersome, opaque, and required one-off scripting and significant
engineering labor with  
no overarching standardized methods. By shifting this paradigm to a
FHIR-based API, we  
anticipate that the market will be able to respond with a new slate of
innovative solutions.  
  
Across this spectrum of population-level uses, the scope or quantity of
the data may  
range from a small group to many hundreds or thousands of patients.
Moreover, when “external”  
applications and services are provided access to patient data by the
provider, we expect that such  
access and associated privacy and security protocols would be
established consistent with  
existing legal requirements under the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules
(including business  
associate agreements), other data use agreements (as applicable), and
any other state or federal  
applicable law. Principally, for the purposes of the proposed
certification criterion, we seek to  
include and ensure through testing and certification that a set of
baseline API functionality exists  
and is deployed for providers to use at their discretion to support
their own clinical priorities as  
well as to use to engage with their partners, such as software
developers and developers of third-  
party applications.  
  
We have explicitly proposed to include support for API services that are
population-level  
focused in this certification criterion because the current
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(8)  
has largely been tested, certified, and deployed to support the “patient
data request” use case. In  
comparison, population-level focused API services are envisioned to
support FHIR-based apps  
that not only improve clinical workflow and decision support but also
help advance a learning  
health system. In so doing, providers, payers, and other stakeholders
will be able to make  
incrementally better use of FHIR’s RESTful API and JSON payload to apply
modern computing

techniques, including big data analyses and machine learning, to account
for, assess, and inform  
the quality and effectiveness of care delivered. As noted in the
proposed API standards section,  
FHIR Release 4 includes technical specifications to enable standardized
population-level  
services via FHIR-based APIs in a more efficient manner than currently
possible. If “Option 3”  
or “Option 4” is preferred by industry in terms of the FHIR standards
options for this  
certification criterion, these approaches would be demonstrable.
Alternatively, if the National  
Coordinator were to approve FHIR Release 4 for use under this proposed
certification criterion  
(following the Standards Version Advancement Process described in
Section VII.B.5 of this  
preamble) then it would be able to be used to meet these technical
expectations.  
Lastly, as we considered the necessary oversight responsibilities the
Cures Act adds to  
the Program, we have determined that it would be essential to include a
specific population-level  
API conformance requirement as part of this criterion so that such
capabilities could be evaluated  
post-certification for compliance with (among other requirements) this
API Condition of  
Certification and the information blocking and real world testing
Conditions of Certification.  
**Specific Proposals**  
In general, we have approached framing § 170.315(g)(10) in the same way
we framed §  
170.315(g)(8). This new proposed criterion, however, includes some
important differences and  
specificity compared to § 170.315(g)(8). Taken together, the following
proposals are designed to  
establish a consistent set of API implementation requirements aimed at
the API Condition of  
Certification’s “without special effort” requirement. We propose that
API technology presented  
by a health IT developer (otherwise considered an API Technology
Supplier in this context) for

testing and certification to the proposed certification criterion in §
170.315(g)(10) would need to  
meet the requirements outlined below. We seek comment on all of the
following proposals.  
**  
*Data Response*  
  
We propose in § 170.315(g)(10)(i) that the health IT presented for
testing and  
certification must be capable of responding to requests for data on a
single patient and multiple  
patients associated with each of the FHIR resources specified in ARCH
Version 1 and consistent  
with FHIR Release 2 and the Argonaut IG implementation specification.
More specifically, we  
clarify that all data elements indicated as “mandatory” and “must
support” by the proposed  
standards and implementation specifications must be supported and would
be in scope for  
testing. Through this approach, certification will provide for a
consistent and predictable starting  
scope of data from which apps and other services can be developed.  
*Search Support*  
  
We propose to require in § 170.315(g)(10)(ii) that the health IT
presented for testing and  
certification must be capable of responding to all of the “supported
searches” specified in the  
Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide Server, which as a reminder we
have proposed for  
adoption as an implementation specification in §
170.215(a)(4).[89](ONCs.html#227) Given that there is not yet a  
consistent, standardized specification for FHIR servers to handle
searches for multiple patients,  
we clarify that a health IT developer would be permitted to approach
searches for multiple  
patients in the manner it deems most efficient to meet this proposed
certification criterion. We  
note, consistent with the implementation specifications current scope,
that conformance would  
focus on search associated with a single patient’s data. However, we
reiterate the health IT

presented for testing and certification and as implemented must support
searches for multiple  
patients independent of a required standard for such searches.  
For the DocumentReference and Provenance resources, which are currently
present in the  
base FHIR standard, we request comments on the minimum “search”
parameters that would need  
to be supported.  
*App Registration*  
  
We propose in § 170.315(g)(10)(iii) that health IT presented for testing
and certification  
must be capable of enabling apps to register with an “authorization
server.” This proposed  
conformance requirement would require an API Technology Supplier to
demonstrate its  
registration process, but would not require that it be done according to
a specific standard. We  
considered proposing the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration
Protocol[(RFC 7591)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591) standard  
(“Dynamic Registration”) as the only way to support registration for
this certification criterion  
and request public comment on whether we should require its support as
part of a final rule’s  
certification criterion. For clarity, we note that while we have not
explicitly required Dynamic  
Registration as the only way to demonstrate conformance with this
specific portion of the  
certification criterion, API Technology Suppliers would still be allowed
to use Dynamic  
Registration if they so choose.  
  
While requiring Dynamic Registration could create a more consistent
registration  
experience for health IT developers, we did not expressly include this
standard because of its  
relatively low adoption and implementation in the health IT ecosystem.
Notably, while the  
SMART Guide covers a majority of technical steps necessary for an app to
connect a FHIR  
server, it is neutral on the registration process API Technology
Suppliers could take. Much like

we did with § 170.315(g)(8) in the initial 2015 Edition final rule by
not requiring FHIR, we  
believe that a prudent approach for registration is to require that it
be addressed from a functional  
perspective while the industry reaches consensus on the best techniques
to enable registration.  
Note, that while this portion of proposed § 170.315(g)(10) focuses on
the technical  
standards conformance, we have also included a specific “maintenance
requirement” associated  
with the API Condition of Certification around the timeliness of this
registration process in  
production settings as applicable to API Technology Suppliers. This
proposed requirement will  
ensure that patients are able to use their apps in a timely manner.  
  
We do not intend to test registration capabilities for apps that would
be executed within  
an API Data Provider’s clinical environment. We believe this discretion
is warranted as API  
Technology Suppliers and API Data Providers are best poised to innovate
and execute various  
methods for app registration within a clinical environment. However, we
request comment on  
this perspective.  
*Secure connection, authentication and authorization*  
  
We propose in § 170.315(g)(10)(iv) that the health IT presented for
testing and  
certification must be capable of establishing a secure and trusted
connection with an application  
that requests patient data in accordance with the SMART Guide*.* In the
context of this proposed  
criterion, this would require that an “authorization server” be deployed
and support, at a  
minimum, “authorize” and “token” endpoints and the publication of the
endpoint URLs via  
FHIR server’s metadata as specified in the SMART Guide to enable
automated discovery by  
apps. Again, we note, consistent with this implementation
specification’s current scope, that

in mind. Given that there is not yet a consistent, standardized
specification for FHIR servers to  
handle secure connection parameters for multiple patients, we clarify
that a health IT developer  
would be permitted to approach secure connections for multiple patients
in the manner it deems  
most efficient to meet this proposed certification criterion.  
  
When an application connects to request data for the first time, we
propose in §  
170.315(g)(10)(v)(A) that health IT presented for testing and
certification must be capable of  
demonstrating support for user authentication according to the OpenID
Connect Core 1.0  
incorporating errata set 1[90](ONCs.html#230)standard. It should be
noted that the OpenID Connect Standard is  
agnostic to the actual authentication mechanism used by the health IT
while providing a standard  
way for health IT to exchange the authentication information to the app.
The primary benefit  
being that it lets apps verify the identity of the end-user based on the
authentication performed by  
the Authorization Server without having the apps to take additional
responsibility for  
authenticating the user. We also propose in § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(B) that
health IT presented for  
testing and certification must demonstrate that users can authorize
applications (in the  
appropriate context) to access data in accordance with the SMART
Guide*.* Pursuant to this  
proposed implementation specification described above, we also intend to
test health IT in the  
“Standalone Launch” and “EHR Launch” modes. Additionally, we clarify
that for the purposes  
of testing and certification, we propose to require that health IT
support only a limited set of  
capabilities related to the OpenID Connect Standard—specifically, only
those that are specified  
in the SMART Guide.

Further, in order to enable patients and providers to get persistent
access to health  
information without having to re-authenticate and re-authorize, we
propose to require that a  
“refresh token” must be provided with an expiration period of at least 3
months from the date  
issued. The “refresh token” could be subsequently used by the app to
obtain a new “access  
token” after the expiration of the original “access token.” Note the
proposed refresh token  
requirement is different than providing an “access token” with an
extended life, which is  
typically discouraged from a security best practice perspective so as to
prevent unauthorized  
access if for some reason the access token were to be acquired for use
by an unauthorized  
application.  
  
We propose in § 170.315(g)(10)(vi) that health IT presented for testing
and certification  
must demonstrate that it can support subsequent connections by an app
and requests data without  
requiring the user to re-authorize and re-authenticate when a valid
refresh token is supplied.  
Further, we propose that once a valid refresh token has been used to get
a new access token that  
the FHIR server must demonstrate that it can issue a new refresh token
to the app, which must be  
for a new period no shorter than three months. For example, if an
application were issued a  
refresh token that was good for three months upon its first-ever
connection and then  
subsequently connected to the FHIR server one month later, the FHIR
server would need to  
enable that connection to occur without re-authentication and
re-authorization, and it would need  
to issue a new refresh token for a new three-month period from that
access date. Again, we  
intend to test health IT in the “Standalone Launch” and “EHR Launch”
contexts pursuant to the  
SMART Guide.

<span id="232"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **232** of **724**  
  
We have proposed this renewal requirement because industry stakeholders
at various  
meetings and conferences at which we have attended have indicated that a
constant need for  
patients to re-authenticate and re-authorize their apps creates
usability challenges and may  
otherwise contradict the Cures Act’s intent associated with the phrase
“without special effort.”  
Further, we are not aware of a standard, consistent methodology for
specifying the lifetime of  
refresh tokens in published technical specifications. As a result, we
believe our approach would  
improve the current user experience for patients and providers alike.
Additionally, authorization  
servers maintain binding between the refresh token and the application
to whom it was issued,  
and hence can protect against misuse by unauthorized applications.  
We believe that the three-month period is a reasonable length given the
proposal for the  
re-issuance of a new refresh token. However, we acknowledge that this
same policy outcome we  
discuss above could be achieved by, for example, having a two-month
period. Accordingly, we  
seek comment on whether there are available specifications we should
review as well as whether  
there should be a reasonable upper bound from a timing perspective
(e.g., one year) after which  
the user should be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize.  
For both the first time connection and subsequent connection proposals,
we recognize  
that there is not yet a consistent, standardized specification for FHIR
servers to handle data  
requests for multiple patients. As noted above, we expect that FHIR
Release 4 will have such  
specificity. However, for the purposes of meeting this proposed
certification criterion, we clarify  
that a health IT developer would be permitted to approach requests for
multiple patients in the  
manner it deems most efficient.  
**Transparency through the Publication of API Documentation**

In the 2015 Edition final rule we included transparent documentation
requirements for all  
three of the API-focused certification criteria adopted in §
170.315(g)(7) through (g)(9). These  
requirements specified that documentation associated with API syntax
(and other technical  
descriptors), the software components and configurations that would be
necessary in order for a  
deployed API to successfully work, and the terms of use for the API be
made publicly available.  
We continue to believe that such a requirement is important for proposed
§ 170.315(g)(10),  
especially in light of the Cures Act’s “without special effort”
provision. Such transparency and  
openness is commonplace in many other industries and has fueled
innovation, growth, and  
competition. Further, we believe that full transparency is necessary to
ensure that software  
developers building to a health IT developer’s (g)(10)-certified API
have a thorough  
understanding of any requirements against which their software will need
to be designed.  
In reconciling the 2015 Edition final rule’s API documentation
requirements with the  
new expectations set forth by the Cures Act regarding a health IT
developer’s practices, we have  
determined that revisions are necessary. Accordingly, we propose to
revise the documentation  
provision in the API certification criteria adopted in § 170.315(g)(7)
through (g)(9) as well as  
reflect the same revision in proposed § 170.315(g)(10) and (11).
Specifically, we propose to  
focus the documentation requirement set forth by the certification
criteria on solely the technical  
documentation associated with the API technology. As a result, we
propose to remove the  
provision in § 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(9) associated with “terms of
use” as this type of  
documentation could be considered more reflective of business practice
and better placed with  
other similar requirements. Consistent with the Cures Act’s API
Condition of Certification, we  
have proposed more detailed Condition of Certification requirements
associated with a health IT

developer’s API terms of use in order to address business practices that
could interfere with and  
create special effort on the part of an API User.  
With respect to the technical documentation that would need to be made
publicly  
available, we recognize that our proposed formal adoption of the FHIR
standard and the  
associated implementation specifications (for § 170.315(g)(10)) would be
consistent across all  
health IT presented for certification. As a result there may be minimal
additional documentation  
needed for these capabilities beyond what is already documented in these
standards and  
specifications. However, pursuant to the limited mandatory scope
proposed for “data response”  
(for § 170.315(g)(10)), we believe that API Technology Suppliers should
disclose any additional  
data their (g)(10)-certified API supports in the context of FHIR
resources referenced in ARCH  
Version1 and associated implementation specifications. For example, the
Argonaut IG “Patient  
Profile” includes optional elements for marital status, photo, and
contact (as in contact person  
like a guardian or friend). To the degree that a (g)(10)-certified API
supports such optional data  
an API Technology Supplier would be required to convey this support in
its published technical  
documentation. Additionally, we note that other specifications, like the
RFC 7591, provide  
developers some latitude in terms of the information that could be
supplied for the purposes of  
registration.  
Thus, we propose in § 170.315(g)(10)(vii) that an API Technology
Supplier would need  
to provide detailed information for all aspects of its (g)(10)-certified
API, especially for any  
unique technical requirements and configurations, such as how the FHIR
server handles requests  
for multiple patients (until such time as there is an approved
standardized approach that can be  
cited) as well as app registration requirements. For aspects that are
not unique and are fully

specified by the FHIR standard and associated implementation
specifications, the developer  
could include hyperlinks to this information as part of its overall
documentation. Further, we  
propose to include the word “complete” in the documentation provision in
order to make this  
point explicit and link this obligation to the associated transparency
conditions proposed as part  
of the overall Condition of Certification. We note for health IT
developers that the  
documentation published must be of the sort and to the level of
specificity, precision, and detail  
that the health IT developer customarily provides to its own employees,
contractors, and/or  
partners who develop software applications for production
environments.  
Lastly, we note that all of the documentation referenced by this
criterion must be  
accessible to the public via a hyperlink without additional access
requirements, including,  
without limitation, any form of registration, account creation,
“click-through” agreements, or  
requirement to provide contact details or other information prior to
accessing the documentation.  
It would also require that such documentation needs to be submitted as
part of testing for this  
certification criterion and subsequently to ONC-ACBs for review prior to
issuing a certification.  
  
  
d. Condition of Certification Requirements  
To implement the Cures Act, we have designed this API Condition of
Certification in a  
manner that will complement the technical capabilities described in our
other proposals, while  
addressing the broader technology and business landscape in which these
API capabilities will be  
deployed and used.  
  
Consistent with the attributes we have identified for the statutory
phrase “without special  
effort,” our overarching vision for this Condition of Certification is
to ensure that (g)(10)-  
certified APIs, among all API technology, are deployed in a manner that
supports an experience

that is as seamless and frictionless as possible. To that end, we seek
to promote a standards-based  
ecosystem that is transparent, scalable, and open to robust competition
and innovation.  
The specific requirements of this Condition of Certification are
discussed in several  
sections below. These requirements would address certain implementation,
maintenance, and  
business practices for which clear and consistent parameters are needed
to ensure that API  
technology is deployed in a manner that achieves the policy goals we
have described. The  
proposed requirements would also align this Condition of Certification
with other requirements  
and policies of the Cures Act that promote interoperability and deter
information blocking, as  
discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.  
  
  
  
i. Scope and Compliance  
To start this Condition of Certification, we propose in § 170.404 to
apply this Condition  
of Certification to health IT developers with health IT certified to
**any** of the API-focused  
certification criteria. These criteria include the proposed
“standardized API for patient and  
population services” (§ 170.315(g)(10)) and “consent management for
APIs” (§ 170.315(g)(11))  
as well as the current “application access – patient selection” (§
170.315(g)(7)), “application  
access – data category request” (§ 170.315(g)(8)), “application access –
all data request” (§  
170.315(g)(9)). In other words, this entire Condition of Certification
**would not** apply to health  
IT developers that do not have technology certified to any of these
API-focused certification  
criteria. Similarly, this condition is solely applicable to these
API-focused certification criteria.  
As a result, the proposed policies for this Condition of Certification
**would not** apply to a health  
IT developer’s practices associated with, for example, the immunization
reporting certification  
criterion adopted in § 170.315(f)(1) because that criterion is not one
of the API-focused criteria.

**NOTICE**

process. The document published in the Federal Register is the official
HHS-approved document.  

-----

<span id="237"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **237** of **724**  
  
However, health IT developers should remain mindful that other proposals
in this proposed rule,  
especially those related to information blocking, could still apply to
its practices associated with  
non-API-focused certification criteria.  
Given the proposed applicability of this condition to current
API-focused criteria and that  
health IT developers with products certified to §§ 170.315(g)(7)-(9)
would need to meet new  
compliance requirements associated with such criteria, we also propose
certain compliance  
timelines associated with this Condition of Certification that would
need to be met.  
ii. Cures Act Condition and Interpretation of Access to “All Data  
Elements”  
First, we propose to adopt the Cures Act’s API Condition of
Certification in §  
170.404(a)(1) to fully incorporate the statute’s compliance
requirements. Second, strictly for the  
scope of the API Condition of Certification, we propose to interpret the
meaning of the phrase  
“all data elements of a patient’s electronic health record” as
follows.  
For the reasons discussed above, the proposed § 170.315(g)(10)
certification criterion and  
associated standards and implementation specifications would facilitate
API access to a limited  
set of data elements (i.e., from the FHIR resources that ARCH Version
1). Accordingly, for the  
purposes of meeting this portion of the Cures Act’s API Condition of
Certification, we interpret  
the scope of: the ARCH; its associated implementation specifications;
and the policy expressed  
around the data elements that must be supported by (g)(10)-certified
APIs (i.e., FHIR servers) to  
constitute “all data elements.” Given other proposals related to
permitting the use of updated  
versions of adopted standards and implementation specifications, we
expect that (g)(10)-certified  
APIs will be able to support access to more data over time in response
to updates to the USCDI

<span id="238"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **238** of **724**  
  
and the ARCH. As these updates occur, the industry would be able to
incrementally approach the  
totality of data that can be electronically accessed, exchanged, and
used pursuant to the Cures  
Act’s reference to “all data elements.”  
Again, we reiterate that this specific interpretation **does not**
extend beyond the API  
Condition of Certification and cannot be inferred to reduce the scope or
applicability of other  
Cures Act Conditions of Certification or the information blocking
proposals, which necessarily  
will include a larger scope of data. For example, other Conditions of
Certification will apply to  
health IT developer behaviors associated with data that are not part of
the USCDI or ARCH,  
such as the proposals at 45 CFR 170.402 and the proposals in Part 171,
which apply across  
several stakeholders including health information networks and health
care providers.  
  
  
  
iii. Transparency Conditions  
  
We propose as part of this Condition of Certification that API
Technology Suppliers be  
required to make specific business and technical documentation freely
and publicly accessible.  
Thus, we propose to adopt several transparency conditions as part of §
170.404(a)(2).  
Similar to our policy associated with the API-focused certification
criteria, we propose in  
§ 170.404(a)(2)(i) that all published documentation be complete and
available via a publicly  
accessible hyperlink that allows any person to directly access the
information without any  
preconditions or additional steps. For example, the API Technology
Supplier cannot impose any  
access requirements, including, without limitation, any form of
registration, account creation,  
“click-through” agreements, or requirement to provide contact details or
other information prior  
to accessing the documentation.

In addition to technical documentation, we propose in §
170.404(a)(2)(ii)(A) to require  
API Technology Suppliers to publish all terms and conditions for use of
its API technology. We  
believe that it is important to make this information readily accessible
to API Data Providers,  
API Users, app developers, and other persons. This transparency would
ensure that these  
stakeholders do not experience “special effort” in the form of
unnecessary costs or delays to  
obtain the terms and conditions for API technology. Further, we believe
that full transparency is  
necessary to ensure that app developers have a thorough understanding in
advance of any terms  
or conditions that might apply to them and do not encounter
unanticipated hurdles once they  
have committed to developing software or attempt to implement or deploy
such software in  
production.  
  
We note that this requirement would apply to *all* terms and conditions
that apply to the  
API technology and its use. As noted above, and for the purposes of this
proposal’s scope, “API  
technology” refers to the specified API capabilities for Health IT
Modules certified to §  
170.315(g)(7) through (11) under the Program. We consider “terms and
conditions” to include  
any fees, restrictions, limitations, obligations, registration process
requirements, and other terms  
or conditions that would be material and needed to:  
• develop software applications to interact with the API technology;  
• distribute, deploy, and enable the use of software applications in
production environments  
that use the API technology;  
• use software applications, including to access, exchange, and use EHI
by means of the API  
technology;  
• use any EHI obtained by means of the API technology; and

• register software applications (as discussed in more below).  
In addition, we propose in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(B) that any and all
permitted fees charged  
by an API Technology Supplier for the use of its API technology must be
published and  
described in detailed, plain language as part of its publicly available
terms and conditions. The  
description of the fees must include all material information,
including, but not limited to, the  
persons or classes of persons to whom the fee applies; the circumstances
in which the fee  
applies; and the amount of the fee, which for variable fees must include
the specific variable(s)  
and methodology(ies) that will be used to calculate the fee.  
  
For the purposes of the specific transparency conditions proposed in §
170.404(a)(2) and  
their relationship and applicability to API Technology Suppliers with
products already certified  
to § 170.315(g)(7) , (8), or (9), we propose to establish a compliance
date of six months from the  
final rule’s effective date (which would give developers approximately
eight months from the  
final rule’s publication date) to revise their existing API
documentation to come into compliance  
with the final rule. We also recognize that API Technology Suppliers
will need to update the  
proposed publicly available information from time to time. Thus, for the
purposes of and with  
respect to subsequent updates to this information, we expect API
technology suppliers to make  
clear to the public the timing information applicable to their
disclosures (e.g., effective/as of date  
or last updated date) in order to prevent out of sync discrepancies in
what an API Technology  
Supplier’s public documentation states and what it may be communicating
directly to its  
customers (e.g., a change in fees is directly communicated to customers
but not reflected at the  
publicly available hyperlink pursuant to its responsibilities under this
proposal). If an API  
Technology Supplier’s actions are out of sync with its publicly provided
documentation, the API

Technology Supplier would be at risk of violating this Condition of
Certification. We request  
public comment on whether this expectation should be formally specified
in regulation text or if  
these “effective date” approaches for changes to transparency
documentation are common place  
such that it would be a standard practice as part of making this
documentation available.  
We also note that API Technology Suppliers would be expected to revise
and/or  
construct terms and conditions for its API technology that account for
and reflect the proposals  
associated with this API Condition of Certification and information
blocking policies. In so far  
as an API Technology Supplier would find it necessary to enforce its
published terms and  
conditions, we caution API Technology Suppliers to be mindful of whether
such terms and  
conditions would be acceptable and consistent with the aforementioned
policies in the first  
place—as an impermissible term or condition would be problematic
regardless of whether it was  
actively enforced.  
We propose in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(C) a final transparency condition
associated with API  
Technology Suppliers’ application developer verification processes that
takes into account the  
fact that we did not propose to adopt the Dynamic Registration standard
as part of proposed §  
170.315(g)(10). Had we proposed requiring Dynamic Registration, we would
have also proposed  
a specific Condition of Certification that would have outright
prohibited API Technology  
Suppliers from identity proofing or verifying authenticity of an app
developer when it came to  
apps that were designed to enable patient access.  
On balance, however, we believe that permitting API Technology Suppliers
to institute a  
process to verify the authenticity of application developers will foster
additional trust in the  
growing API ecosystem. We seek comments and recommendations on factors
that would enable

registration with minimal barriers. For example, permitting API
Technology Suppliers to do one-  
time verification of the app developers (or even rely on centralized
vetting by a trusted third  
party), which would allow the developer’s future apps to automatically
register without case-by-  
case checks (or checks for each API Technology Supplier with which the
app developer  
interacts). One risk to consider with Dynamic Registration plus a
prohibition on vetting, for  
instance, is that it would be much easier for a malicious app developer
to spoof another  
legitimate app developer’s app. Such an action could ultimately lead to
confusion and distrust in  
the market. However, the Dynamic Registration option would minimize
barriers to registration  
especially for third-party apps designed to enable patient access. We
seek comments on options  
and trade-offs we should consider.  
Accordingly, and weighing those concerns with the Cures Act’s “without
special effort”  
provision and our proposed information blocking policies, we
specifically propose to permit API  
Technology Suppliers to institute a process to verify the authenticity
of application developers so  
long as such process is completed within five business days
[91](ONCs.html#242) of receipt of an application  
developer’s request to register their software application with the API
technology’s authorization  
server. To clarify, this verification process would need to focus
specifically on the application  
developer—not its software application(s). We also clarify that API
Technology Suppliers would  
have the discretion to establish their verification process so long as
the process is objective and  
the same for all application developers and it can reasonably be
completed within the five  
business days—otherwise such a process could risk implicating/violating
other elements of this  
  
91 We consider a “business day” to include the normal work days and
hours of operation during a week (Monday  
through Friday), excluding federal holidays and weekends.

proposed API Condition of Certification as well as information blocking
behaviors. The  
following includes a few non-exhaustive examples of verification
techniques that could be used  
by an API Technology Supplier to have additional certainty about the
application developer with  
whom they are interacting: instituting a “penny verification” process,
requiring some form of  
corporate documentation, or requesting other forms of authenticating
documentation or  
transactions.  
We believe that five business days is sufficient time for API Technology
Suppliers to  
weed out malicious developers seeking to deceive the API Technology
Supplier, API Data  
Providers or API Users, but request public comment on other timing
considerations. Moreover,  
we clarify that this proposed Condition of Certification is meant to set
the upper bound for a  
verification process an API Technology Supplier would be permitted to
take and should **not** be  
interpreted as compelling API Technology Suppliers to institute such a
process (i.e., API  
Technology Suppliers would not be required to institute a verification
process). Rather, for those  
API Technology Suppliers that see it in their (as well as their
customers and patients) best  
interests to institute such a process, we have laid out the rules that
we believe meet the Cures  
Act’s without special effort expectations. If an API Technology Supplier
chooses not to institute  
an app developer verification process prior to enabling the production
use of an app, it would  
solely need to meet the Maintenance of Certification requirement
associated with enabling apps  
for production use discussed in more detail below.  
We remind stakeholders that even in the case where an API Technology
Supplier chooses  
not to vet app developers, the apps would *not* have carte blanche
access to a health care  
provider’s data. To the contrary, such apps will still be registered and
thus be identifiable and

able to have their access deactivated by an API Technology Supplier or
health care provider  
(API Data Provider) if they behave in anomalous or malicious ways (e.g.,
denial of service  
attack). And a patient seeking access to their data using the app will
need to authenticate  
themselves (using previously issued credentials by a health care
provider or trusted source) and  
authorize: 1) the app to connect to the FHIR server; and 2) specify the
scope of the data the app  
may access.  
  
As a separate matter, we also recognize that in order to assure health
care providers that  
the apps they use within their health IT will operate appropriately,
will fully integrate into  
workflow, and will not degrade overall system performance, that API
Technology Suppliers may  
establish additional mechanisms to vet app developers. Such mechanisms
could fit into the  
“value-added services” permitted fee and result in the app being
acknowledged or listed by the  
health IT developer in some special manner (e.g., in an “app store,”
“verified app” list). While  
our proposals do not specify any explicit limits to the nature and
governance of these approaches,  
we wish to caution health IT developers that even though such processes
have a reasoned basis in  
providing an added layer of trust above and beyond the basic
production-readiness of an app,  
they can equally be used as a means to prevent, limit, and otherwise
frustrate innovation,  
competition, and access to the market. Such an outcome would be
inconsistent with the Cures  
Act, could directly violate the specific Condition of Certification
associated with fees permitted  
for value-added services, and could constitute information blocking.

<span id="245"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **245** of **724**  
  
As part of this API Condition of Certification, we propose to adopt
specific conditions  
that would set boundaries for the fees API Technology Suppliers would be
permitted to charge  
and to whom those permitted fees could be charged. As a reminder, these
proposals would only  
apply to a health IT developer’s business practices associated with its
“API technology” (i.e., the  
capabilities certified to § 170.315(g)(7) through (11)). We seek comment
on all of the following  
proposals.  
In § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(A), we propose to establish a general prohibition
on API  
Technology Suppliers imposing fees associated with API technology. This
general prohibition is  
meant to ensure that API Technology Suppliers do not engage in pricing
practices that create  
barriers to entry and competition for apps and API-based services that
health care providers seek  
to use. These outcomes would be inconsistent with the goal of enabling
API-based access,  
exchange, and use of EHI by patients and other stakeholders without
special effort.  
  
In establishing this general prohibition, we have been mindful of the
need for API  
Technology Suppliers to recover their costs and to earn a reasonable
return on their investments  
in providing API technology that has been certified under the Program.
Accordingly, we have  
identified categories of “permitted fees” that API Technology Suppliers
would be permitted to  
charge and still be compliant with the Condition of Certification and
Program requirements, and  
discuss these proposals below. We emphasize, however, and propose in
detail below, that API  
Technology Suppliers would not be permitted in any way whatsoever to
impose fees on any  
person in connection with an API Technology Supplier’s work to support
the use of API  
technology to facilitate a patient’s ability to access, exchange, or use
their EHI.

<span id="246"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **246** of **724**  
  
We note that other than for fees charged for “value-added services”
(proposed in §  
170.404(a)(3)(iv)), the fees permitted under this Condition of
Certification must arise between an  
API Technology Supplier and an API Data Provider. Any fee that arises in
connection with an  
API User’s use of API technology would need to exist solely between the
API Data Provider and  
the API User. This policy reinforces the autonomy that we believe API
Data Providers should  
have to establish relationships with API Users. However, as discussed in
detail below, API  
Technology Suppliers would be permitted to charge API Data Providers
based on the usage  
activities of API Users.  
We also seek to clarify that while the proposed permitted fees set the
boundaries for the  
fees API Technology Suppliers would be permitted to charge and to whom
those permitted fees  
could be charged, they do not prohibit who may pay the API Technology
Supplier’s permitted  
fee. In other words, these conditions limit the party from which an API
Technology Supplier  
may require payment, but they do not speak to who may pay the fee. For
example, if through  
some type of relationship/agreement an API User or other party offered
to pay the fee an API  
Data Provider owed to an API Technology Supplier, that practice would be
allowed and  
unaffected under these conditions. This is an acceptable practice
because the fee is first arrived at  
between the API Technology Supplier and API Data Provider, and then API
Technology  
Supplier receives payment from another party via the API Data Provider
or directly on behalf of  
the API Data Provider. As a general matter, we note that stakeholders
should be mindful of other  
federal and state laws and regulations that could prohibit or limit
certain types of relationships  
involving remuneration.

We note that the proposed “permitted fees conditions” align with the
requirements of the  
information blocking exceptions proposed in 45 CFR 171.204 and 171.206.
Any fee that would  
not be covered by those exceptions, and that would, therefore, be
suspect under the information  
blocking provision, would equally not be permitted by this API Condition
of Certification. We  
strongly encourage readers to review our proposals associated with those
exceptions, which are  
contained in sections VIII.D.4 and VIII.D.6 of this preamble,
respectively.  
*Permitted Fees – General Conditions*  
We propose in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B) general conditions that an API
Technology  
Supplier’s fee must satisfy in order for such fee to be expressly
permitted and thus not  
contravene the proposed Condition of Certification. First, we propose in
§ 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)*(1)*  
that in order to be a permitted fee, a fee imposed by an API Technology
Supplier must be based  
on objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly applied for all
substantially similar or  
similarly situated classes of persons and requests. This would require
an API Technology  
Supplier to apply fee criteria that, among other things, would lead an
API Technology Supplier  
to come to the same conclusion with respect to the permitted fee’s
amount each time it interacted  
with a class of persons or responded to a request. Accordingly, the fee
could not be based on the  
API Technology Supplier’s subjective judgment or discretion.  
Moreover, in order to be permitted, the fee must not be based in any
part on whether the  
API User is a competitor or potential competitor, or on whether the API
Data Provider or API  
User will be using the data accessed via the API technology in a way
that facilitates competition  
with the API Technology Supplier. This condition is intended to ensure
that any fee charged by  
an API Technology Supplier does not have the purpose or effect of
excluding or creating

impediments for competitors, business rivals, or other persons engaged
in developing or enabling  
the use of API technology. We believe these fee limitations are
necessary in light of the potential  
for API Technology Suppliers to use their control over API technology to
engage in  
discriminatory practices that create barriers to API technology. These
principles are consistent  
with the approach described in section VIII of this preamble
(“information blocking”).  
Second, we propose in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)*(2)* that in order to be a
permitted fee, a fee  
imposed by an API Technology Supplier must be reasonably related to the
API Technology  
Supplier’s costs of supplying and, if applicable, supporting the API
technology to, or at the  
request of, the API Data Provider to whom the fee is charged. For
example, the API Technology  
Supplier would not be permitted to charge a fee when the underlying
costs relevant to the supply  
or service have already been accounted for or recovered through other
fees (regardless of  
whether such fees were charged to the API Data Provider or to other
persons). Moreover, an API  
Technology Supplier that conditioned access to its API technology on
revenue-sharing or the  
entry into a royalty agreement would be at significant risk of imposing
a fee that bore no  
plausible relation to the costs incurred by the API Technology Supplier
to develop the API  
technology or support its use by API Users.  
Third, we propose in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)*(3)* to require that in order
to be a permitted  
fee, the costs of supplying, and if applicable, supporting the API
technology upon which the fee  
is based must be reasonably allocated among all customers to whom the
API technology is  
supplied or for whom it is supported. A reasonable allocation of costs
would require that the API  
Technology Supplier allocate its costs in accordance with criteria that
are reasonable and  
between only those API Data Providers that either cause the costs to be
incurred or benefit from

the associated supply or support of the API technology. If an API
Technology Supplier  
developed API technology that could be supplied to multiple customers
with minimal tailoring,  
the core costs of developing its API technology should be allocated
among those customers when  
recovered as a fee. The API Technology Supplier would not be permitted
to recover the total of  
its core costs from each customer. Similarly, when an API Technology
Supplier uses shared  
facilities and resources to support the usage of API technology, it
would need to ensure that  
those shared costs were reasonably allocated between all of the
customers that benefited from  
them. However, whenever an API Technology Supplier is required to
provide services and incur  
costs that are unique to a particular customer, it would not need to
distribute those costs among  
other customers that had deployed its API technology.  
Last, we propose in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)*(4)* to require that in order
to be a permitted fee,  
the API Technology Supplier must ensure that fees are not be based in
any part on whether the  
requestor or other person is a competitor, potential competitor, or will
be using the API  
technology in a way that facilitates competition with the API Technology
Supplier. The use of  
such criteria would be suspect because it suggests the fee the API
Technology Supplier is  
charging is not based on its reasonable costs to provide the API
technology or services and may  
have the purpose or effect of excluding or creating impediments for
competitors, business rivals,  
or other persons engaged in developing or enabling the use of API
technologies and services.  
We request comments on these general conditions for permitted fees and
whether  
commenters believe we have created effective guardrails to ensure that
fees do not prevent EHI  
from being accessed, exchanged, and used through the use of APIs without
special effort. **

As noted above, we propose that API Technology Suppliers would be
prohibited from  
charging fees associated with API technology unless such fees are
expressly permitted.  
Additionally, as a reminder, the scope of “API technology” subject to
these proposals would only  
include certified health IT that fulfill the API-focused certification
criteria adopted or proposed  
for adoption at 45 CFR 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(11). Thus, all other
API functionality provided  
by a health IT developer with its product(s) that have no link to these
certified capabilities would  
**not** be subject to this Condition of Certification.  
The following proposals outline the specific circumstances in which an
API Technology  
Supplier would be permitted to charge fees associated with API
technology certified under the  
Program. A fee that satisfies one of the permitted fees in §§
170.404(a)(3)(ii)-(iv) must also  
satisfy each of the general conditions in § 170.404(a)(3)(i) in order to
be permitted and for its  
recovery compliant with this Condition of Certification. **  
Permitted Fee for Developing, Deploying, and Upgrading API Technology  
  
In § 170.404(a)(3)(ii), we propose to permit an API Technology Supplier
to charge API  
Data Providers reasonable fees for developing, deploying, and upgrading
API technology. Fees  
for “developing” API technology comprise the API Technology Supplier’s
costs of designing,  
developing, and testing API technology to specifications that fulfill
the requirements of the API-  
focused certification criteria adopted or proposed for adoption at 45
CFR 170.315(g)(7) through  
(g)(11). Fees for developing API technology must not include the API
Technology Supplier’s  
costs of updating the non-API related capabilities of the API Technology
Supplier’s existing  
health IT, including its databases, as part of its development of the
API technology. These costs  
would be connected to past business decisions made by the API Technology
Supplier and

typically arise due to health IT being designed or implemented in
nonstandard ways that  
unnecessarily increase the complexity, difficulty or burden of
accessing, exchanging, or using  
EHI. The recovery of the costs associated with updating an API
Technology Supplier’s health IT  
generally would be inconsistent with the Cures Act requirement that API
technology be deployed  
“without special effort.”  
The API Technology Supplier’s fees for “deploying” API technology
comprise the API  
Technology Supplier’s costs of operationalizing API technology in a
production environment.  
Such fees include, but are not limited to, standing up hosting
infrastructure, software installation  
and configuration, and the creation and maintenance of API Data Provider
administrative  
functions. An API Technology Supplier’s fees for “deploying” API
technology does not include  
the costs associated with managing the traffic of API calls that access
the API technology, which  
an API Technology Supplier can only recover under the permitted fee for
usage support costs  
under § 170.404(a)(3)(iii). For clarity, we reiterate that for the
purpose of this Condition of  
Certification, we consider that API technology is “deployed” by the
customer—the API Data  
Provider—that purchased or licensed it.  
The API Technology Supplier’s fees for “upgrading” API technology
comprise the API  
Technology Supplier’s costs of supplying an API Data Provider with an
updated version of API  
technology. Such costs would include the costs required to bring API
technology into conformity  
with new requirements of the Program, upgrades to implement general
software updates (not  
otherwise covered by development fees or under warranty), or developing
and releasing newer  
versions of the API technology at the request of an API Data Provider.

<span id="252"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **252** of **724**  
  
The nature of the costs that can be charged under this category of
permitted fees will  
depend on the scope of the work to be undertaken by an API Technology
Supplier (i.e., how  
much or how little labor an API Data Provider requires of the API
Technology Supplier to  
deploy and upgrade the API technology being supplied). For example,
where an API Data  
Provider decides to fully outsource the deployment of its API technology
to its API Technology  
Supplier, the API Technology Supplier’s costs will include the work
associated with the  
development of the API technology, the work deploying the API
technology, and any work  
upgrading the API technology.  
We propose that any fees that an API Technology Supplier charges for
developing,  
deploying, or upgrading API technology must be charged solely to the API
Data Provider(s) for  
whom the capabilities are deployed. We propose this limitation because
we believe that these  
costs should be negotiated between the API Technology Supplier that
supplies the capabilities  
and the API Data Provider (i.e., health care provider) that implements
them in its production  
environment. In our view, it is inappropriate to pass these costs on to
API Users as doing so  
would impose considerable costs on the API Data Provider’s current or
potential partners, such  
as those offering third-party applications and services, as well as the
end-users of API  
technology and would amount to the kind of “special effort” that the
Cures Act’s API Condition  
of Certification seeks to prevent.  
Subject to the general conditions proposed in § 170.404(a)(3)(i) and
discussed above,  
API Technology Suppliers can recover the full range of reasonable costs
associated with  
developing, deploying, and upgrading API technology over time. We
believe it is important that  
API Technology Suppliers be able to recover these costs and earn a
reasonable return on their

investments so that they have adequate incentives to make continued
investments in these  
technologies. In particular, we anticipate that API Technology Suppliers
will need to continually  
expand the data elements and upgrade the capabilities associated with
Certified APIs as the  
FHIR standard and its implementation specifications mature, and the
National Coordinator  
expands the USCDI and ARCH.  
Permitted Fee to Recover Costs of Supporting API Usage for Purposes
Other than Patient  
Access, Exchange, and Use  
In § 170.404(a)(3)(iii) we propose to permit an API Technology Supplier
to charge  
usage-based fees to API Data Providers to the extent that the API
technology is used for  
purposes other than facilitating access, exchange, or use of EHI by
patients or their applications,  
technologies, or services.  
We consider “usage-based” fees to be the fees imposed by an API
Technology Supplier  
to recover the costs that would typically be incurred supporting API
interactions at increasing  
volumes and scale within established service levels. That is,
“usage-based” fees recover costs  
incurred by an API Technology Supplier due to the actual use of the API
technology once it has  
been deployed (e.g., costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data,
or number of apps via the  
API technology). We acknowledge that API Technology Suppliers could
adopt a range of pricing  
methodologies when charging for the support of API usage. We expect that
API usage support  
fees would only come into play when the API Technology Supplier acts on
behalf of the API  
Data Provider to deploy its API technology. Thus, the costs recovered
under “usage-based” fees  
would only be able to reflect “post-deployment” costs. As such,
“usage-based” fees **would not**  
be allowed to include any costs necessary to prepare and “get the API
technology up, running,

and ready for use,” which are costs that we propose should be recovered
as part of the  
deployment services delivered by the API Technology Supplier if
permitted under §  
170.404(a)(3)(ii). We believe this Condition of Certification offers the
flexibility necessary to  
accommodate reasonable pricing methodologies and will allow API
Technology Suppliers to  
explore innovative approaches to recovering the costs associated with
supporting API use as a  
permitted fee.  
As discussed above, we expect that API usage support fees would only
come into play  
when the API Technology Supplier acts on behalf of the API Data Provider
to deploy its API  
technology. Conversely, in scenarios where the API Data Provider, such
as a large hospital  
system, assumes full responsibility for the technical infrastructure
necessary to deploy and host  
the API technology it has acquired, the volume and scale of its usage
would be the API Data  
Provider’s sole responsibility. As a result, in this scenario and under
our proposal’s structure, an  
API Technology Supplier would **not** be permitted to charge usage-based
fees. Instead, the API  
Technology Supplier would be limited to the fees it would be permitted
to recover through the  
“development, deployment, upgrade” permitted fee discussed above.  
We reiterate, that “usage-based” fees would need to be settled between
an API  
Technology Supplier and API Data Provider. The API Technology Supplier
would have no  
standing to go around or through the API Data Provider to issue fees to,
for example, a  
population health analytics company engaged by an API Data Provider who
accesses the API  
Data Provider’s data via the API technology.  
We propose that any usage-based fees associated with API technology be
limited to the  
recovery of the API Technology Supplier’s “incremental costs.” An API
Technology Supplier’s

“incremental costs” comprise the API Technology Supplier’s costs that
are directly attributable  
to supporting API interactions at increasing volumes and scale within
established service levels.  
We propose than an API Technology Supplier should “price” its costs of
supporting access to the  
API technology by reference to the additional costs that the API
Technology Supplier would  
incur in supporting certain volumes of API use. In practice, we expect
that this means that API  
Technology Suppliers will offer a certain number of “free” API calls
based on the fact that, up to  
a certain threshold, the API Technology Supplier will not incur any
material costs in supporting  
API technology in addition to the costs recovered for deployment
services. However, after this  
threshold is exceeded, we expect that the API Technology Supplier will
impose usage-based  
costs commensurate to the additional costs that the API Technology
Supplier must incur to  
support API technology use at increasing volumes and scale.  
We expect that API Technology Suppliers would charge fees that are
correlated to the  
incremental ratchetting up of the cost required to meet increased
demand. For example, if, at a  
certain volume of API calls, the API Technology Supplier needed to
deploy additional server  
capacity, the associated incremental cost of bringing an additional
server online could be passed  
on to the API Data Provider because the API technology deployed on
behalf of the API Data  
Provider was the subject of the higher usage. Up until the point that
the threshold is reached, the  
additional server capacity was not required and so the API Technology
Supplier would not be  
permitted to recover the cost associated with it. Moreover, the
additional server capacity would  
support ongoing demand up to a certain additional volume, and so the API
Technology Supplier  
would not be permitted to recover the costs of further additional server
capacity until the then  
current capacity was exhausted.

Notwithstanding the above, we note that API Technology Suppliers may
choose to  
charge for their API usage support services on a “pay as you go” basis,
such as a fee-per-call  
pricing structure. This approach could be consistent with the
requirement that the API  
Technology Supplier only impose its incremental costs, and the
requirements of this Condition of  
Certification more generally. However, depending on the amount being
charged, this pricing  
model is open to abuse, with API Data Providers at risk of paying
unreasonably high fees if the  
volume of API use is high and when the API Data Provider does not share
in the benefits  
enjoyed by the API Technology Supplier when delivering a service at
scale. As such, the API  
Technology Supplier would need to be careful to ensure that the total
fees paid by an API Data  
Provider were reasonably related to the API Technology Supplier’s costs
of supporting the API  
technology. Where the fees paid over a reasonable measuring period were
not reasonably related  
to the API Technology Supplier’s costs, they would not be permitted.  
We are also aware that API Technology Suppliers may offer a pricing
structure for API  
usage support based on unlimited API calls. That is, the API Technology
Supplier may charge a  
flat-fee irrespective of the volume of traffic accessing the API
technology. Such a pricing model  
would be allowed under the proposed condition provided that the API
Technology Supplier’s fee  
for API usage support was reasonably related to the cost of the services
that it had agreed to  
provide. This would mean that the API Technology Supplier would need to
make a realistic  
estimate of the volume of API calls that it would need to support to
fulfill any service level  
promised, and calculate its fee based on the costs of supporting that
call volume. So long as the  
API Technology Supplier made a realistic estimate of the anticipated
volume and support level,

the legitimacy of the API Technology Supplier’s fees, and its ability to
recover them as permitted  
fees, would be unaffected by API Users making lower than expected use of
API technology.  
In the context of this proposed permitted fee’s scope and the proposed
general prohibition  
on fees, we seek to make clear that API Technology Suppliers would be
prohibited from  
charging (or including in their contracts and agreements with API Data
Providers) any usage-  
based fees for API uses that are associated with the access, exchange,
and use of EHI by patients  
or their applications, technologies, or services. This would include,
among other things, API calls  
or other transactions initiated by or on behalf of a patient, including
third parties (e.g., an  
application or any other technology or service) authorized by the
patient or their representative to  
request data on their behalf.  
Usage fees associated with the access, exchange, and use of EHI by
patients is a specific  
example of a prohibited fee that would fit under the general prohibition
of a “fee not otherwise  
permitted” and is based on several considerations. First, such fees
between an API Technology  
Supplier and API Data Provider would likely be passed on directly to
patients, creating a  
significant impediment to their ability to access, exchange, and use
their EHI, without special  
effort, through applications and technologies of their choice. More
fundamentally, most of the  
information contained in a patient’s electronic record has been
documented during the practice of  
medicine or has otherwise been captured in the course of providing
health care services to  
patients. In our view, patients have effectively paid for this
information, either directly or  
through their employers, health plans, and other entities that negotiate
and purchase health care  
items and services on their behalf. Thus, our proposal reflects our
belief that it is inappropriate to  
charge patients additional costs to access this information, whether
those costs are charged

directly to patients or passed on as a result of fees charged to persons
that provide apps,  
technologies, and services on a patient’s behalf.  
To be clear, if an API Data Provider sought to employ API technology for
the limited  
purpose of making EHI available to patients and their apps, the API Data
Provider’s API  
Technology Supplier would have no legitimate basis to charge the API
Data Provider, or any  
other person, for the “patient access” usage-based costs associated with
the API technology.  
Any unreasonable fees associated with a patient’s access to their EHI
may be suspect  
under the information blocking provision. Such fees may also be
inconsistent with an  
individual’s right of access to their PHI under the HIPAA Privacy Rule
(45 CFR 164.524). )  
In addition to our proposal in § 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(A) and detailed
above that this  
permitted fee would not include any costs incurred by the API Technology
Supplier to support  
uses of the API technology that facilitate a patient’s ability to
access, exchange, or use their  
electronic health information, we also propose to explicitly exclude two
additional costs from  
this permitted fee. In § 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(B), we propose that this
permitted fee would not  
include costs associated with intangible assets (including depreciation
or loss of value), except  
the actual development or acquisition costs of such assets. For
instance, an API Technology  
Supplier could not charge an API Data Provider a fee based on the
purported “cost” of allowing  
the API Data Provider to use the API Technology Supplier’s patented API
technology. As  
discussed in more detail in section VIII.D.4 (Information Blocking), we
believe it would be  
inappropriate to permit an actor to charge a fee based on these
considerations, which are  
inherently subjective and could invite the kinds of rent-seeking and
opportunistic pricing  
practices that create barriers to access, use, and exchange of EHI and
impede interoperability.

In § 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(C), we propose that this permitted fee would not
include  
opportunity costs, except for the reasonable forward-looking cost of
capital. These speculative  
costs could include revenues that an API Technology Supplier could have
earned had it not  
provided the API technology. We clarify that the exclusion of
opportunity costs would not  
preclude an API Technology Supplier from recovering its reasonable
forward-looking cost of  
capital. We believe these costs are relatively concrete and that
permitting their recovery will  
protect incentives for API Technology Suppliers to invest in developing
and providing  
interoperability elements (as described in section VIII.D.4).  
Permitted Fee for Value-added Services  
  
In § 170.404(a)(3)(iv) we propose to permit an API Technology Supplier
to charge fees  
to API Users[92](ONCs.html#259) for value-added services supplied in
connection with software that can interact  
with the API technology. These “value-added services” would need to be
provided in connection  
with and supplemental to the development, testing, and deployment of
software applications that  
interact with API technology. Critically, fees would not be permitted if
they interfere with an  
API User’s ability to efficiently and effectively develop and deploy
production-ready software.  
This means that in order to be permitted, an API User could not be
required to incur the fee in  
order to develop and deploy a production-ready software application that
interacts with the API  
technology acquired by the API Data Provider. Rather, a fee will only be
permitted if it relates to  
a service that a software developer can elect to purchase, but is not
required to purchase in order  
to develop and deploy production-ready apps.  
  
92 In this context a health care provider, which could otherwise be an
“API Data Provider” in one context, may  
equally be an API User in a different context. Given this potential dual
role for health care providers, we have  
focused on API Users as the party to whom a fee may be charged for the
purposes of this permitted fee.

<span id="260"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **260** of **724**  
  
We believe it appropriate to permit this type of fee because API
Technology Suppliers  
may offer a wide-range of market differentiating services to make it
attractive for API Users to  
develop software applications that can interact with the API technology
supplied by an API  
Technology Supplier. Such services could include advanced training,
premium development  
tools and distribution channels, and enhanced compatibility/integration
testing assessments. For  
example, an API Technology Supplier would be permitted to charge fees
for value-added  
services that would be associated with but go beyond the scope set by
the (g)(10)-certified API,  
such as write access, co-branded integration into the API Technology
Supplier’s product(s)  
workflow, co-marketing arrangements, and promoted placement in an API
Technology  
Supplier’s app store. That said, we caution API Technology Suppliers
that value-added services  
would have to be made available in a manner that complies with other
requirements of this  
Condition of Certification and with the information blocking
provision.  
To illustrate the scope of the fees permitted under this proposal, we
clarify that the  
permitted value-added services fee would enable an API Technology
Supplier to recover certain  
costs associated with operating an “app store.” However, those fees
cannot interfere with an API  
User’s ability to efficiently and effectively develop and deploy
production-ready apps without  
special effort. We are aware that API Technology Suppliers offer
services associated with the  
listing and promotion of apps beyond basic app placement. Such fees
would be permitted, so  
long as the API Technology Supplier ensured that basic access and
listing in the app store was  
provided free of charge if an app developer depended on such listing to
efficiently and  
effectively develop and deploy production-ready apps without special
effort. Fees charged for  
additional/specialized technical support or promotion of the API User’s
app beyond these basic

access and listing services would also be permitted. In contrast, if an
API Technology Supplier  
required, for example, a software developer’s app to go through a paid
listing process as a  
dependency/precondition to be able to be deployed (and generally
accessible) to the API  
Technology Supplier’s health care provider customers to use, this would
not be a permitted fee  
under this Condition of Certification, would constitute special effort,
and could raise information  
blocking concerns.  
Prohibited Fees  
As discussed above, we proposed that any API-related fee imposed by an
API  
Technology Supplier that is not expressly permitted is prohibited. This
approach is necessary  
because, as discussed in section VIII.C.5.c of this proposed rule, we
continue to receive evidence  
that some health IT developers are engaging in practices that create
special effort when it comes  
to API technology. These practices include fees that create barriers to
entry or competition as  
well as rent-seeking and other opportunistic behaviors. For example,
some health IT developers  
are conditioning access to technical interoperability documentation on
revenue-sharing or royalty  
agreements that bear no plausible relation to the costs incurred by the
health IT developer to  
provide or enable its use. We are also aware of discriminatory pricing
policies that have the  
purpose or effect of excluding competitors from the use of APIs and
other interoperability  
elements. These practices close off the market to innovative
applications and services that could  
empower patients and enable providers to deliver greater value and
choice to health care  
consumers and additional service providers.  
  
To address these concerns we provide the following non-exhaustive
examples of fees for  
services that API Technology Suppliers **would be** **prohibited** from
charging:

• Any fee for access to the documentation that an API Technology
Supplier is required to  
publish or make available under this Condition of Certification.  
• Any fee for access to other types of documentation or information that
a software developer  
may reasonably require to make effective use of API technology for any
legally permissible  
purpose.  
• Any fee in connection with any services that would be essential to a
developer or other  
person’s ability to develop and commercially distribute production-ready
applications that  
use API technology. These services could include, for example, access to
“test  
environments” and other resources that an app developer would need to
efficiently design  
and develop apps. The services could also include access to distribution
channels if they are  
necessary to deploy production-ready software and to production
resources, such as the  
information needed to connect to FHIR servers (endpoints) or the ability
to dynamically  
register with an authorization server.  
*Permitted Fees Request for Comment*  
We request comment on any additional specific “permitted fees” not
addressed above that  
API Technology Suppliers should be able to recover in order to assure a
reasonable return on  
investment. Furthermore, we request comment on whether it would be
prudent to adopt specific,  
or more granular, cost methodologies for the calculation of the
permitted fees. Commenters are  
encouraged to consider, in particular, whether the approach we have
described will be  
administrable and appropriately balance the need to ensure that
patients, providers, app  
developers, and other stakeholders do not encounter unnecessary costs
and other special effort  
with the need to provide adequate assurance to API Technology Suppliers,
investors, and

innovators that they will be able to earn a reasonable return on their
investments in API  
technology. We welcome comments on whether the approach adequately
balances these  
concerns or would achieve our stated policy goals, and we welcome
comments on potential  
revisions or alternative approaches. We encourage detailed comments that
include, where  
possible, economic justifications for suggested revisions or alternative
approaches.  
*Record-keeping requirements*  
  
To provide appropriate accountability, we propose in § 170.404(a)(3)(v)
that API  
Technology Suppliers must keep for inspection detailed records of all
fees charged with respect  
to API technology and all costs that it claims to have incurred to
provide API technology to API  
Data Providers. To provide assurance that the API Technology Supplier’s
fees are reasonably  
related to the API Technology Supplier’s costs, the API Technology
Supplier would need to  
document, with the same level of detail, any fees charged and associated
costs incurred to  
provide other services to which any portion of the costs could
reasonably be attributed. For  
example, if the API Technology Supplier charges a fee that reflects its
costs for internet servers  
used to provide the API technology, the API Technology Supplier would
need to document the  
costs of any other internet-based services it provides, as well as any
other purposes for which the  
internet servers are used.  
  
Separately, an API Technology Supplier would need to document the
criteria it used to  
allocate any costs across relevant customers, requestors, or other
persons. The criteria must be  
documented in a level of detail that would enable determination as to
whether the API  
Technology Supplier’s cost allocations are objectively reasonable and
comply with the cost  
accountability requirements, including whether fees reflect the API
Technology Supplier’s actual

costs reasonably incurred, were allocated reasonably and between only
those API Data Providers  
that either cause the costs to be incurred or benefit from the
associated supply or support of the  
API technology, and were distributed across customers and other relevant
persons in a  
permissible manner, as described above.  
  
We note that an API Technology Supplier must retain its accounting
records consistent  
with the retention requirement proposed for adoption as part of the
Assurances Condition of  
Certification (proposed for adoption in § 170.402). In the event that a
potential violation of this  
Condition and Maintenance of Certification creates a conformance
fact-finding scenario by ONC  
or information blocking is investigated, we believe that this period of
time would provide ONC  
with appropriate visibility into the API Technology Supplier’s business
practices.  
  
We request comment on whether these requirements provide adequate
traceability and  
accountability for costs permitted under this API Condition of
Certification. We also seek  
comment on whether to require more detailed accounting records or to
prescribe specific  
accounting standards.  
  
  
  
iv. Openness and Pro-competitive Conditions  
  
We propose that API Technology Suppliers would have to comply with
certain  
requirements to promote an open and competitive marketplace. As a
general condition, we  
propose in § 170.404(a)(4) that API Technology Suppliers must grant API
Data Providers (i.e.,  
health care providers who purchase or license API technology) the sole
authority and autonomy  
to permit API Users to interact with the API technology deployed by the
API Data Provider. We  
reinforce this general condition through more specific proposed
conditions proposals discussed  
below that would require API Technology Suppliers to provide equitable
access to API

technology, which would include granting the rights and providing the
cooperation necessary to  
enable apps to be deployed that use the API technology to access,
exchange, and use EHI in  
production environments.  
  
As important context for these proposals, we note that the API
technology required by  
this Condition of Certification falls squarely within the concept of
“essential interoperability  
elements” described in section VIII.C.4.b of this preamble and, as such,
are subject to strict  
protections under the information blocking provision. As a corollary, to
the extent that API  
Technology Suppliers claim an intellectual property right or other
proprietary interest in the API  
technology, they must take care not to impose any fees, require any
license terms, or engage in  
any other practices that could add unnecessary cost, difficulty, or
other burden that could impede  
the effective use of the API technology for the purpose of enabling or
facilitating access,  
exchange, or use of EHI. Moreover, even apart from these information
blocking considerations,  
we believe that, as developers of technology certified under the
Program, API Technology  
Suppliers owe a special responsibility to patients, providers, and other
stakeholders to make API  
technology available in a manner that is truly “open” and minimizes any
costs or other burdens  
that could result in special effort. The proposed conditions set forth
below are intended to  
provide clear rules and expectations for API Technology Suppliers so
that they can meet these  
obligations.  
*Non-Discrimination*  
  
We propose in § 170.404(a)(4)(i) that an API Technology Supplier must
adhere to a  
strictly non-discriminatory policy regarding the provision of API
technology. As a starting point,  
we propose to require in § 170.404(a)(4)(i)(A) that API Technology
Suppliers comply with all of

<span id="266"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **266** of **724**  
  
the requirements discussed in section VIII.C.4.b of this proposed rule
regarding the non-  
discriminatory provision of interoperability elements. Accordingly, and
consistent with  
developers’ obligations under the Program and our expectation that API
technology be truly  
“open,” we propose to require that API Technology Suppliers must provide
API technology to  
API Data Providers on terms that are no less favorable than they would
provide to themselves  
and their customers, suppliers, partners, and other persons with whom
they have a business  
relationship. This requirement would apply to both price and non-price
terms and thus would  
apply to any fees that the API Technology Supplier is permitted to
charge under the “permitted  
charges conditions” of this Condition of Certification. We believe this
requirement would ensure  
that API Data Providers (i.e., health care providers) who purchase or
license API technology  
have sole authority and autonomy to permit third-party software
developers to connect to and use  
the API technology they have acquired.  
Next, we propose in § 170.404(a)(4)(i)(B) that any terms and conditions
associated with  
API technology would have to be based on objective and verifiable
criteria that are uniformly  
applied for all substantially similar or similarly situated classes of
persons and requests. For  
example, if the API Technology Supplier applied an “app store”
entry/listing process unequally  
and added arbitrary criteria based on the use case(s) an app was focused
on, such business  
practices would not comply with this specific condition and could also
be in violation of the  
information blocking provision.  
Moreover, we propose in § 170.404(a)(4)(i)(C) that an API Technology
Supplier would  
be prohibited from offering or varying such terms or conditions on the
basis of impermissible  
criteria, such as whether the API User with whom the API Data Provider
has a relationship is a

competitor, potential competitor, or will be using EHI obtained via the
API technology in a way  
that facilitates competition with the API Technology Supplier. The API
Technology Supplier  
would also be prohibited from taking into consideration the revenue or
other value the API User  
with whom the API Data Provider has a relationship may derive from
access, exchange, or use of  
EHI obtained by means of the API technology. We believe these proposals
will help promote  
greater equity and competition in market as well as prevent
discriminatory business practices by  
API Technology Suppliers.  
  
*Rights to Access and Use API Technology*  
  
We propose in § 170.404(a)(4)(ii)(A) that an API Technology Supplier
would have to  
make API technology available in a manner that enables API Data
Providers and API Users to  
develop and deploy apps to access, exchange, and use EHI in production
environments. To this  
end, we propose that an API Technology Supplier must have and, upon
request, must grant to  
API Data Providers and their API Users all rights that may be reasonably
necessary to access and  
use API technology in a production environment. In other words, this
proposal is focused on the  
provision of rights reasonably necessary to access and use API
technology and does not extend  
to other intellectual property maintained by the API Technology
Supplier, especially intellectual  
property that has no nexus with the access and use of API technology. In
situations where such a  
nexus exists, even partially, the API Technology Supplier would have the
duty to determine a  
method to grant the applicable rights reasonably necessary to access and
use the API technology.  
And if practicable, under these partial cases, we note that it would be
possible for the API  
Technology Supplier to exclude the intellectual property that would have
no impact on the access  
and use of the API technology.

Accordingly, following our proposal, API Technology Suppliers would need
to grant API  
Data Providers and their API Users with rights that could include but
not be limited to the  
following in order to sufficiently support the use of the API
technology:  
• For the purposes of developing products or services that are designed
to be interoperable with  
the API Technology Supplier’s health IT or with health IT under the API
Technology  
Supplier’s control.  
• Any marketing, offering, and distribution of interoperable products
and services to potential  
customers and users that would be needed for the API technology to be
used in a production  
environment. Note, API Technology Suppliers, pursuant to the
“value-added services”  
permitted fee, would be able to offer and charge for services such as
preferential marketing  
agreements, co-marketing agreements, and other business arrangements so
long as such  
services are beyond what is necessary for the API technology to be put
into use in a  
production environment.  
• Enabling the use of the interoperable products or services in
production environments,  
including accessing and enabling the exchange and use of electronic
health information.  
  
Relatedly, in § 170.404(a)(4)(ii)(B) we propose to prohibit an API
Technology Supplier  
from imposing any collateral terms or agreements that could interfere
with or lead to special  
effort in the use of API technology for any of the above purposes. We
note that these collateral  
terms or agreements may also implicate the information blocking
provision for the reasons  
described in section VIII.D.3.c of this preamble. These specific
proposed conditions would  
expressly prohibit an API Technology Supplier from conditioning any of
the rights described  
above on the requirement that the recipient of the rights do, or agree
to do, any of the following:

• Pay a fee to license the rights described above, including but not
limited to a license fee,  
royalty, or revenue-sharing arrangement.  
• Not compete with the API Technology Supplier in any product, service,
or market.  
• Deal exclusively with the API Technology Supplier in any product,
service, or market.  
• Obtain additional licenses, products, or services that are not related
to or can be unbundled  
from the API technology.  
• License, grant, assign, or transfer any intellectual property to the
API Technology Supplier.  
• Meet additional developer or product certification requirements.  
• Provide the API Technology Supplier or its technology with reciprocal
access to application  
data.  
  
These prohibitions largely mirror those proposed under the exception to
the information  
blocking definition in § 171.206 and reflect the same concerns expressed
in that context in  
section VIII.D.3.c of this preamble. However, we note the following
important distinction:  
Whereas proposed § 171.206 would permit a developer to charge a
reasonable royalty to license  
interoperability elements, this API Condition of Certification would not
permit any such royalty,  
license fee, or other type of fee of any kind whatsoever pursuant to the
general fee prohibition  
proposed in the “permitted charges condition.” This additional
limitation reflects the more  
exacting standards that apply to API Technology Suppliers with respect
to the provision of API  
technology under this Condition of Certification. While we believe that,
for the reasons  
described in section VIII.D.3.c of this preamble, health IT developers
should generally be  
permitted to charge reasonable royalties for the use of their
intellectual property, we consider  
API technology to be a special case. Certified health IT developers

Suppliers) are required to provide these capabilities as part of their
statutory duty to facilitate the  
access, exchange, and use of patient health information from EHRs
“without special effort.” We  
believe the language requiring that these capabilities be “open”
precludes an API Technology  
Supplier from conditioning access to API technology on the payment of a
royalty or other fee,  
however “reasonable” the fee might otherwise be.  
  
We clarify that the prohibitions explained above against additional
developer or Health  
IT Module certification requirements and, separately, against
requirements for reciprocal access  
to application data, are within the scope of the collateral terms
prohibited by proposed § 171.206  
even though these additional API Technology Supplier requirements are
not explicitly referenced  
by that exception because they are not generally applicable to all types
of interoperability  
elements. Nevertheless, permitting an API Technology Supplier to impose
these kinds of  
additional requirements would be inconsistent with the Cures Act’s
expectation that API  
technology be made available openly and in a manner that promotes
competition. For the same  
reason such practices may raise information blocking concerns.  
  
*API Technology Suppliers – Additional Obligations*  
  
To support the use of API technology in production environments, we
propose in §  
170.404(a)(4)(iii) that an API Technology Supplier must provide all
support and other services  
that are reasonably necessary to enable the effective development,
deployment, and use of API  
technology by API Data Providers and its API Users in production
environments. In general, the  
precise nature of these obligations will depend on the specifics of the
API Technology Supplier’s  
technology and the manner in which it is implemented and made available
for specific  
customers. Therefore, with the following exceptions, we do not delineate
the API Technology

<span id="271"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **271** of **724**  
  
Supplier’s specific support obligations and instead propose a general
requirement to this effect in  
§ 170.404(a)(4)(iii).  
Changes and Updates to API Technology and Terms and Conditions  
  
We propose to require in § 170.404(a)(4)(iii)(A) that API Technology
Suppliers must  
make reasonable efforts to maintain the compatibility of the API
technology they develop and  
assist API Data Providers to deploy in order to avoid disrupting the use
of API technology.  
Similarly, we propose in § 170.404(a)(4)(iii)(B) that prior to making
changes or updates to its  
API technology or to the terms or conditions thereof, an API Technology
Supplier would need to  
provide notice and a reasonable opportunity for its API Data Provider
customers and registered  
application developers to update their applications to preserve
compatibility with its API  
technology or to comply with any revised terms or conditions. Without
this opportunity, clinical  
and patient applications could be rendered inoperable or operate in
unexpected ways  
unbeknownst to the users or software developers.  
Further, we note that this proposal aligns with the exception to the
information blocking  
definition proposed in § 171.206. As explained in section VIII.D.3.c of
this preamble, the  
information blocking definition would be implicated were an API
Technology Supplier to make  
changes to its API technology that “break” compatibility or otherwise
degrade the performance  
or interoperability of the licensee’s products or services that
incorporate the licensed API  
technology. We propose these additional safeguards are important in
light of the ease with which  
an API Technology Supplier could make subtle “tweaks” to its technology
or related services,  
which could disrupt the use of the licensee’s compatible technologies or
services and result in  
substantial competitive and consumer injury.

<span id="272"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **272** of **724**  
  
  
We clarify that this requirement would in no way prevent an API
Technology Supplier  
from making improvements to its technology or responding to the needs of
its own customers or  
users. However, the API Technology Supplier would need to demonstrate
that whatever actions  
it took were necessary to accomplish these purposes and that it afforded
the licensee a reasonable  
opportunity under the circumstances to update its technology to maintain
interoperability.  
Relatedly, we recognize that an API Technology Supplier may have to
suspend access or make  
other changes immediately and without prior notice in response to
legitimate privacy, security, or  
patient safety-related exigencies. Such practices would be permitted by
this Condition of  
Certification provided they are tailored and do not unnecessarily
interfere with the use of API  
technology. From an information blocking standpoint, if such practices
interfered with access,  
exchange, or use of EHI, the API Technology Supplier could seek coverage
under the exceptions  
to the information blocking provision described in section VIII.D of
this preamble. For instance,  
if the suspended access was in response to a privacy exigency, the API
Technology Supplier may  
be able to seek coverage under the exception for promoting the privacy
of EHI at proposed §  
171.202.  
e. Maintenance of Certification Requirements  
  
We propose to adopt Maintenance requirements for this Condition of
Certification. These  
maintenance requirements would be duties that we believe the Cures Act
expected API  
Technology Suppliers (i.e., health IT developers) would need to comply
with in the course of  
maintaining their Health IT Module(s)’ certification.  
  
  
  
i. App Registration Timeliness

<span id="273"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **273** of **724**  
  
  
In the specific context of application registration, we wish to
underscore that to provide a  
frictionless experience for developers of these applications and
individuals that use them, an API  
Technology Supplier would be required to provide all services and other
support necessary to  
ensure that such apps can be deployed and used in production without any
additional assistance  
or intervention by the API Technology Supplier. For this reason, we
propose in § 170.404(b)(1) a  
specific requirement for API Technology Suppliers that they would need
to “register” (in  
connection with the API technology functionality proposed in §
170.315(g)(10)(iii)) and enable  
all applications for production use within one business day of
completing its verification of an  
application developer’s authenticity as described in proposed §
170.404(a)(2)(ii)(C). We propose  
this explicit requirement is necessary in order to ensure that a
patient’s ability to use an app of  
their choice is not artificially or intentionally slowed by an API
Technology Supplier, causing  
special effort on the part of the patient to gain access to their EHI.
We also emphasize that this is  
specific duty for API Technology Suppliers in the course of maintaining
the Health IT  
Module(s)’ certificate to which their API technology is associated. In
instances where an API  
Technology Supplier chooses not to perform app developer verification
processes described in  
proposed § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(C), it would need to solely meet this one
business day requirement  
from the point of having received a request for registration.  
  
  
  
ii. Publication of FHIR Endpoints  
  
In order to interact with a FHIR RESTful API, an app needs to know the
“FHIR Service  
Base URL,” which is often referred to colloquially as a “FHIR server’s
endpoint.”[93](ONCs.html#273)The public  
availability and easy accessibility of this information is a central
necessity to assuring the use of

<span id="274"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **274** of **724**  
  
FHIR-based APIs without special effort, especially for patient access
apps. Accordingly, we  
propose to adopt in § 170.404(b)(2) a specific requirement that an API
Technology Supplier  
must support the publication of Service Base URLs for all of its
customers, regardless of those  
that are centrally managed by the API Technology Supplier or locally
deployed, and make such  
information publicly available (in a computable format) at no charge. In
instances where an API  
Technology Supplier is contracted by an API Data Provider to manage its
FHIR server, we  
expect that this administrative duty will be relatively easy to manage.
In instances where an API  
Data Provider assumes full responsibility to “locally manage” its FHIR
server, the API  
Technology Supplier would be required, pursuant to this proposed
maintenance requirement, to  
obtain this information from its customers. We strongly encourage API
Technology Suppliers,  
health care providers, HINs and patient advocacy organizations to
coalesce around the  
development of a public resource or service from which all stakeholders
could benefit. We  
believe this would help scale and enhance the ease with which Service
Base URLs could be  
obtained and used.  
  
  
  
iii. Providing (g)(10)-Certified APIs to API Data Providers  
We propose in § 170.404(b)(3) that an API Technology Supplier with API
technology  
previously certified to the certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(8)
must provide all API Data  
Providers with such API technology deployed with API technology
certified to the certification  
criterion in § 170.315(g)(10) within 24 months of this final rule’s
effective date. We believe this  
Maintenance of Certification requirement will permit ONC to monitor and
facilitate the rollout to  
health care providers of this important functionality. This is of
particular relevance as we  
propose below to include this functionality in the 2015 Base EHR
definition in place of the

current “application access – data category request” certification
criterion (§ 170.315(g)(8)),  
which means health care providers will need this functionality to meet
the Certified EHR  
Technology (CEHRT) for associated Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS)  
programs.  
  
  
f. 2015 Edition Base EHR Definition  
  
As described in detail above, we have propose to adopt a new
certification criterion in §  
170.315(g)(10) that would replace the current criterion adopted in §
170.315(g)(8) and as  
referenced in the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition expressed in §
170.102. This change is  
necessary to fully implement the Cures Act and ensure that API
Technology Suppliers have the  
requisite incentive to deploy standardized APIs that can be used
“without special effort” and API  
Data Providers have added incentive to adopt such functionality. As
result, we propose to create  
a phase-in for the proposed API certification criterion in §
170.315(g)(10) from the issuance of a  
subsequent final rule. This phase-in period includes separate and
sequential time for API  
Technology Suppliers and API Data Providers.  
Consistent with our proposed compliance timing for the certification
criterion proposed  
for adoption in § 170.315(b)(10), we propose to add compliance timeline
language to the 2015  
Edition Base EHR definition for the transition from § 170.315(g)(8) to §
170.315(g)(10) that  
would reflect a total of 24 months from the final rule’s effective date
(which practically speaking  
would be 25 months because of the 30-day delayed effective date). We
believe this approach is  
best because it identifies a single, specific date for both API
Technology Suppliers and API Data  
Providers by which upgraded API technology needs to be deployed in
production. We also  
believe that 24 months is sufficient for this upgrade because the scope
and nature of our

proposals intersect and reflect a large portion of capabilities API
Technology Suppliers have  
already developed and deployed to meet § 170.315(g)(8). Moreover, this
single date enables API  
Technology Suppliers (based on their client base and IT architecture) to
determine the most  
appropriate timeline for development, testing, certification, and
product release cycles in  
comparison to having to meet an arbitrary “must be certified by this
date” requirement.  
5\. Real World Testing  
  
The Cures Act requires, as a Condition and Maintenance of Certification
under the  
Program, that health IT developers have successfully tested the real
world use of the technology  
for interoperability in the type of setting in which such technology
would be marketed. The  
Cures Act defines interoperability as “health information technology
that enables the secure  
exchange of electronic health information with, and use of electronic
health information from,  
other health information technology without special effort on the part
of the user; allows for  
complete access, exchange, and use of all electronically accessible
health information for  
authorized use under applicable state or federal law; and does not
constitute information  
blocking as also defined by the Cures Act.”[94](ONCs.html#276)We propose
to codify this interoperability  
definition in § 170.102. We further note that we propose in section VIII
of this proposed rule to  
codify the definition of information blocking included in the Cures Act
in § 171.103.  
  
The Program issues, and will continue to issue under our real world
testing approach,  
certifications to health IT through a process whereby health IT is
assessed against the testing  
requirements established by ONC. Often, this means health IT is tested
by an ONC-ATL in a  
laboratory environment through methods that include a testing proctor’s
visual inspection of

functions, review of developer-provided documentation of functions, and
testing tools with  
simulation test data. An ONC-ACB evaluates the results of testing and
makes a determination,  
based on these test results and an assessment of compliance with other
Program requirements, to  
issue the health IT a certificate. Over the course of the Program’s
existence, ONC has  
emphasized the continued conformance of certified health IT products
post-certification in real  
world and clinical settings. For example, ONC expanded the
responsibilities of ONC-ACBs in  
the 2015 Edition final rule to require that they perform in-the-field
surveillance. We did this to  
affirm the Program’s long-standing expectations that certified health IT
continue to operate in  
accordance with certification requirements when implemented in the field
(80 FR 62707-62719).  
These efforts are also in line with the Cures Act’s real world testing
Condition of Certification  
through their focus on system interoperability and exchange of
information as deployed and used  
in care environments—that is to say, in the “real world.”  
  
The objective of real world testing is to verify the extent to which
certified health IT  
deployed in operational production settings is demonstrating continued
compliance to  
certification criteria and functioning with the intended use cases as
part of the overall  
maintenance of a health IT’s certification. Real world testing should
ensure certified health IT  
has the ability to share electronic health information with other
systems. Real world testing  
should assess that the certified health IT is meeting the intended use
case(s) of the certification  
criteria to which it is certified within the workflow, health IT
architecture, and care/practice  
setting in which the health IT is implemented. Accordingly, we propose
that successful real  
world testing means for the purpose of this Condition of Certification
that:

• The certified health IT continues to be compliant to the certification
criteria to which it is  
certified, including the required technical standards and vocabulary
codes sets;  
• The certified health IT is exchanging electronic health information in
the care and practice  
settings for which it is intended for use; and  
• Electronic health information is received by and used in the certified
health IT.  
  
We propose to limit the applicability of this Condition of Certification
to health IT  
developers with Health IT Modules certified to one or more 2015 Edition
certification criteria  
focused on interoperability and data exchange, which are:  
• The care coordination criteria in § 170.315(b);  
• The clinical quality measures (CQMs) criteria in § 170.315(c)(1)
through (c)(3);  
• The “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” criterion in §
170.315(e)(1);  
• The public health criteria in § 170.315(f);  
• The application programming interface criteria in § 170.315(g)(7)
through (g)(11); and  
• The transport methods and other protocols criteria in § 170.315(h).  
  
The 2015 Edition certification criteria that are not included in the
proposed list include  
many functionality-based criteria, administrative criteria, and,
overall, criteria that do not focus  
on interoperability *and* exchange of data. In particular, we do not
propose to include the 2015  
Edition paragraph (a) “clinical” certification criteria in this list
because they do not focus on  
interoperability and exchange of data. However, the data in the
paragraph (a) criteria largely will  
be covered through the USCDI as a minimum data set expected for
exchange; the USCDI is  
included in such criteria as “transitions of care” (§ 170.315(b)(1)),
“view, download, and  
transmit to 3rd party” (§ 170.315(e)(1)), and the API criteria (i.e., §
170.315(g)(9) and (10)).

We solicit comment on whether to include the “patient health information
capture”  
certification criteria in § 170.315(e)(3), including the value of real
world testing these  
functionalities compared to the benefit for interoperability and
exchange. We also solicit  
comment on whether any other 2015 Edition certification criteria should
be included or removed  
from the applicability list for this Condition of Certification.  
  
To fully implement the real world testing Condition of Certification as
described above,  
we propose Maintenance of Certification requirements that would require
health IT developers to  
submit publicly available prospective annual real world testing plans
and retrospective annual  
real world testing results for its certified health IT that include
certification criteria focused on  
interoperability. As we considered the various approaches to implement
this Cures Act  
requirement on health IT developers, we determined that health IT
developers would be best  
positioned to construct how their certified health IT could be tested in
the real world. Moreover,  
by requiring health IT developers to be responsible for facilitating
their certified health IT testing  
in production settings and being held accountable to publicly publish
their results, we would  
balance the respective burden of this statutory requirement with its
intended assurances for  
health care providers. Additionally, ONC is not adequately resourced to
centrally administer a  
real world testing regime among each health IT developer and its
customers, nor do we have the  
specific relationships with health care providers that health IT
developers do. Lastly, even if  
ONC were positioned to support and scale a real world testing regime, we
would run the risk of  
having one-size-fits-all tools that would not necessarily get to the
level of detail and granularity  
necessary and reflective of different health care settings and different
scopes of practice that use  
certified health IT.

hyperlink no later than  
December 15, of each calendar year for each of its certified 2015
Edition Health IT Modules that

the ONC-ACB, the plan would need to be approved by a health IT developer
authorized  
representative capable of binding the health IT developer for execution
of the plan and include  
the representative’s contact information. The plan would need to include
all health IT certified to  
the 2015 Edition through August 31 of the preceding year. The plan would
also need to address  
the health IT developer’s real world testing for the upcoming calendar
year and include, for each  
of the certification criteria in scope:  
• The testing method(s)/methodology(ies) that will be used to
demonstrate real world  
interoperability, including a mandatory focus on scenario- and use
case-focused testing;  
• The care and practice setting(s) that will be tested for real world
interoperability, including  
conformance to certification criteria requirements, and an explanation
for the health IT  
developer’s choice of care setting(s) to test;[95](ONCs.html#280)  
• The timeline and plans for voluntary updates to standards and
implementation specifications  
that ONC has approved (further discussed below);  
• A schedule of key real world testing milestones;  
• A description of the expected outcomes of real world testing;  
  
95 We do not propose to specifically define or limit the care settings
and leave it to the health IT developer to  
determine. As an example, health IT developers can consider categories,
including but not limited to, those used in  
the EHR Incentive
Programs[(https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-  
Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/October2017\_MedicareEHRIncentivePayments.pdf)](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/October2017_MedicareEHRIncentivePayments.pdf);  
long-term and post-acute care; pediatrics; behavioral health; and small,
rural, and underserved settings.

• At least one measurement/metric associated with the real world
testing; and  
• A justification for the health IT developer’s real world testing
approach.  
The intended testing methods/methodologies would need to address testing
scenarios, use  
cases, and workflows associated with interoperability. Testing may occur
in the operational  
setting using real patient data, in an environment that mirrors the
clinical setting using synthetic  
or real patient data, or in the clinical setting with synthetic data
intermixed. Note that when  
Health IT developers who are HIPAA business associates are conducting
testing using ePHI,  
such testing must be conducted consistent with their business associate
agreements and other  
compliance responsibilities. The health IT developer may also partner
with other health IT  
developers to perform real world testing. We would expect developers to
consider such factors as  
the size of the organization that production systems support, the type
of organization and setting,  
the number of patient records and users, system components and
integrations, and the volume  
and types of data exchange in planning for real world testing. We would
also expect developers  
to explain how they will incorporate voluntary standards updates in
their real world testing as  
discussed further below. While we are not proposing a minimum proportion
of the customer base  
that must be covered in real world testing, we highly encourage
developers to find ways to  
ensure, to the extent practical, proportionate coverage of their
customer base that balances the  
goals of real world testing with burden to providers. Health IT
developers would not be required  
to test the certified health IT in each and every setting in which it is
intended for use as this  
would likely not be feasible due to the associated burden; however,
developers must address  
their choice of care and/or practice settings to test and ONC encourages
developers test in as  
many settings as feasible. Additionally, health IT developers would be
required to provide a

justification for their chosen approach. Because our approach provides
great flexibility for health  
IT developers with respect to demonstrating compliance, we believe it is
imperative that they  
provide a justification to explain their methodology. Through the
transparent reporting of their  
real world testing plans, the public will have an opportunity to
consider a health IT developer’s  
chosen approach(es) and whether it is sufficiently comprehensive to
provide assurance that the  
certified health IT has satisfactorily demonstrated its satisfaction of
Program requirements  
including interoperability in real world settings relevant to their
needs.  
  
Health IT developers should consider existing testing tools and
approaches that may be  
used to assess real world interoperability. For example, we encourage
health IT developers to  
consider metrics of use and exchange from existing networks,
communities, and tools including,  
but not limited to, Surescripts, Carequality, CommonWell Health
Alliance, the C-CDA One-  
Click Scorecard, and DirectTrust. We do not believe that testing through
the ONC-approved test  
procedures is sufficient to demonstrate real world use as the test
procedures developed for initial  
laboratory testing and certification are generally setting agnostic,
focused on standards  
conformance, and do not always test the full scope of the certification
criteria’s intended  
functionality. We also clarify that the ONC-approved test procedures are
not intended for use in  
in-the-field surveillance or for real world testing. Further, we do not
believe connect-a-thons are  
a valid approach to testing real world use of health IT because they do
not necessarily assess  
interoperability and functionality in live settings, but rather test
developer/vendor connectivity in  
a closed test environment. Health IT developers may consider working
with an ONC-ACB to  
have the ONC-ACB oversee the execution of the health IT developer’s real
world testing plans,

which could include in-the-field surveillance per § 170.556, as an
acceptable approach to meet  
the requirements of the real world testing Condition of Certification.  
  
We propose that health IT developers with multiple certified health IT
products that may  
include the same interoperability-focused certification criteria
intended to be implemented in the  
same settings have the discretion to design their real world testing
plans in a way that efficiently  
tests a combination of products. Likewise, health IT developers may find
portions of their real  
world testing plans are transferrable to their other certified products;
thus a health IT developer  
could choose to submit a real world testing plan that covers multiple
certified products as  
appropriate and as long as there is traceability to the specific
certified Health IT Modules. To be  
clear, developers of health IT products deployed through the cloud who
offer their products for  
multiple types of settings would be required to test the same capability
for those different  
settings. However, we solicit comment on whether we should offer an
exemption for services  
that truly support all of a developer’s customers through a single
interface/engine and whether  
this would be sufficient to meet the intent of the real world testing
Condition of Certification.  
Additionally, while the developers’ plans must address each of the
interoperability-focused  
certification criteria in their certified health IT, developers can and
should design scenario-based  
test cases that incorporate multiple functionalities as appropriate for
the real world workflow and  
setting.  
We propose that a health IT developer would submit annual real world
testing results to  
their ONC-ACBs via a publicly accessible hyperlink no later than January
31, of each calendar  
year for the preceding calendar year’s real world testing. Real world
testing results for each  
interoperability-focused certification criterion must address the
elements required in the previous

year’s testing plan, describe the outcomes of real world testing with
any challenges encountered,  
and provide at least one measurement or metric associated with the real
world testing. As noted  
above, developers are encouraged to use metrics demonstrating real world
use from existing  
networks and communities. We seek comment on whether ONC should require
developers  
submit real world testing results for a minimum “core” set of general
metrics/measurements and  
examples of suggested metrics/measurements. We also invite comment on
the proposed annual  
frequency and timing of required real world testing results reporting.  
We acknowledge that a subsequent final rule for this proposed rule may
not provide  
sufficient time for health IT developers to develop and submit plans for
a full year of real world  
testing in 2020. If such a situation comes to fruition, we expect to
provide an appropriate period  
of time for developers to submit their plans and potentially treat 2020
as a “pilot” year for real  
world testing. We would expect that such pilot testing conform to our
proposed real world testing  
to the extent practical and feasible (e.g., same criteria but for a
shorter duration and without the  
same consequences for non-compliance). We welcome comments on this
potential approach.  
We clarify, and propose, that even if a health IT developer does not
have customers or  
has not deployed their certified Health IT Module at the time the real
world testing plan is due,  
the health IT developer would still need to submit a plan that addresses
its prospective testing for  
the coming year for any health IT certified prior to August 31 of the
preceding calendar year. If a  
health IT developer does not have customers or has not deployed their
certified Health IT  
Module when the annual real world testing results are due, we propose
that the developer would  
need to report as such to meet the proposed Maintenance of Certification
requirement. For

further clarity, a developer would not need to report on any health IT
certified after August 31, in  
the preceding year.  
*Standards Version Advancement Process*  
As new and more advanced versions[96](ONCs.html#285) become available
for adopted standards and  
implementation specifications applicable to criteria subject to the real
world testing Condition  
and Maintenance of Certification Requirements, we believe that a health
IT developer’s ability to  
conduct ongoing maintenance on its certified Health IT Module(s) to
incorporate these new  
versions is essential to support interoperability in the real world.
Updated versions of standards  
reflect insights gained from real-world implementation and use. They
also reflect industry  
stakeholders’ interests to improve the capacity, capability, and clarity
of such standards to meet  
new, innovative business needs, which earlier standards versions cannot
support. Therefore, as  
part of the real world testing Condition of Certification, we propose a
Maintenance of  
Certification flexibility that we refer to as the Standards Version
Advancement Process. The  
Standards Version Advancement Process would permit health IT developers
to voluntarily use in  
their certified Health IT Modules newer versions of adopted standards so
long as certain  
conditions are met, not limited to but notably including successful real
world testing of the  
Health IT Module using the new version(s).  
We propose to establish the Standards Version Advancement Processnot
only to meet the  
Cures Act’s goals for interoperability, but also in response to the
continuous stakeholder  
feedback that ONC has received through prior rulemakings and
engagements, which requested  
  
96 We note that standards development organizations and consensus
standards bodies use various nomenclature, such  
as “versions,” to identify updates to standards and implementation
specifications.

that ONC establish a predictable and timely approach within the Program
to keep pace with the  
industry’s standards development efforts. Rulemaking has not kept up
with the pace of standards  
development and deployment in the health care market. There is no better
evidence of this reality  
than by example from our 2015 Edition rulemaking finalized approximately
three years ago and  
before the Cures Act added Conditions and Maintenance of Certification
provisions to the  
PHSA. Two version updates of the National Health Care Survey standard
(versions 1.1 and 1.2)  
have been issued since we adopted version 1.0 in the 2015 Edition final
rule (October 16, 2015).  
Health IT developer and health care provider compliance and use of these
versions has and will  
be necessary for submission to Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) even though  
the certification criterion adopted in § 170.315(f)(7) continues to
require conformance to version  
1.0. Similarly, many other adopted standards have seen multiple newer
versions introduced to the  
market since we issued the 2015 Edition final rule, such as for eCQM
reporting or e-prescribing.  
The proposed Standards Version Advancement Process flexibility gives
health IT developers the  
option to avoid such unnecessary costs and can help reduce market
confusion by enabling  
certified Health IT Modules keep pace with standards advancement and
market needs including  
but not limited to those related to emerging public health concerns.  
We have also been informed by stakeholders that, in other cases, ONC’s
inability to more  
nimbly identify and incorporate newer versions to standards and
implementation specifications  
that were already adopted by the Secretary into the Program has
perversely impacted standards  
developing organization (SDO) processes. Although SDOs can rapidly
iterate version updates to  
standards and implementation specifications to address ambiguities and
implementation  
challenges reported from the field and to particularly address matters
that adversely impact

interoperability, the lack of a clear path for that work effort to be
timely realized as part of the  
Program’s certification requirements has had a chilling effect on the
pace of change. It can also  
affect the willingness of volunteers at these SDOs to devote their time
to make updates that  
would be outdated by the time ONC goes through a rulemaking, which can
be years.  
Stakeholders have indicated that certified health IT developers,
customers and users of certified  
health IT, and the SDO industry have been technologically restricted and
innovation-stunted as a  
result of our prior regulatory approach, which focused on certification
assuring compliance only  
to the version of a standard adopted in regulation and did not provide
an avenue for the Program  
to accommodate iterative updates to standards during the time between
rulemakings. With the  
passage of the “maintenance of certification” provision in § 4002 of the
Cures Act, we believe  
the approach proposed here is in line with our new statutory authority
regarding Conditions of  
Certification and Maintenance of Certification and would better and more
timely support market  
demands for widespread interoperability.  
In supporting more rapid advancement of interoperability, we believe the
proposed  
Standards Version Advancement Process approach will benefit patient
care, improve  
competition, and spur additional engagement in standards development. To
this point, currently,  
if the USCDI v1 were adopted as currently proposed in § 170.213 and then
needed to be updated  
to add just one data class or data element (e.g., a new demographic
element), we would need to  
initiate notice and comment rulemaking to incorporate that USCDI version
change into the  
Program. Likewise, similar updates to standards included in our 2015
Edition final rule are made  
annually (or more frequently) by SDOs. In order to attempt to keep pace
with such updates,  
which are published at different times of the year, ONC would need to
continuously engage in

rulemaking cycles, perhaps even more than once per year. We believe that
the proposed  
Standards Version Advancement Process would allow for more advanced
versions of standards  
and implementation specifications to be approved for use under the
Program in a more timely  
and flexible manner that helps to ease the concerns stakeholders have
reported. Stakeholder input  
throughout the Program’s existence has informed ONC that updating large
groupings of  
standards’ versions while also adopting new standards through
rulemakings that only occur about  
once every three years can create an artificial market impact in a
number of ways. Such “all-in-  
one” updates affect all health IT developers and the vast majority of
health care providers at the  
same time across all sectors rather than enabling a more incremental and
market-based upgrade  
cycle in response to interoperability, business, and clinical needs.  
The Standards Version Advancement Process and corresponding proposed
revisions to §§  
170.550 and 170.555 would introduce two types of administrative
flexibility for health IT  
developers participating in the Program. First, for those health IT
developers with an existing  
certified Health IT Module, the Health IT Modules would be permitted to
be upgraded (in the  
course of ongoing maintenance) to a new version of an adopted standard
within the scope of the  
certification (without having to retest or recertify) so long as such
version was approved by the  
National Coordinator for use in certification through the Standards
Version Advancement  
Process. Second, for those health IT developers seeking to have a Health
IT Module’s initial  
certificate issued, the Health IT Module would be permitted to be
presented for certification to a  
new version of an adopted standard so long as such version was approved
by the National  
Coordinator through the Standards Version Advancement Process. This
policy flexibility is  
similar to the flexibility we introduced several years ago for “minimum
standards” code sets, but

we would require ONC-ACBs to offer certification under the Standards
Version Advancement  
Process to National-Coordinator-approved newer versions of all standards
to which Real World  
Testing requirements apply.[97](ONCs.html#289)  
In order to ensure equitable treatment under the Program and in order
for ONC to  
maintain the Program’s overall integrity, each developer that chooses to
leverage the proposed  
Standards Version Advancement Process Maintenance of Certification
Program flexibilities  
would need to satisfy the following.  
*Health IT Developers Updating Already Certified Health IT*  
In instances where a health IT developer has certified a Health IT
Module, including but  
not limited to instances where its customers are already using the
certified Health IT Module, if  
the developer intends to update pursuant to the Standards Version
Advancement Process  
election, the developer would be required to provide advance notice to
all affected customers and  
its ONC-ACB: (a) expressing its intent to update the software to the
more advanced version of  
the standard approved by the National Coordinator through the Standards
Version Advancement  
Process; (b) the developer’s expectations for how the update will affect
interoperability of the  
affected Health IT Module as it is used in the real world; and (c)
whether the developer intends  
to continue to support the certificate for the existing Health IT Module
version for some period  
of time and how long, or if the existing version of the Health IT Module
certified to prior  
version(s) of applicable standards will be deprecated (e.g., that the
developer will stop supporting  
  
97 For purposes of clarity, we note that the Standards Version
Advancement Process would not affect the established  
minimum standards code sets flexibility. Consistent with § 170.555,
under the Program, health IT could continue to  
be certified or upgraded to a newer version of identified minimum
standards code sets (*see* 80 FR 62612) than even  
the most recent one the National Coordinator had approved for use in the
Program via the Standards Version

the earlier version of the module and request to have the certificate
withdrawn). The notice  
would be required to be provided sufficiently in advance of the
developer establishing its  
planned timeframe for implementation of the upgrade to the more advanced
standard(s)  
version(s) in order to offer customers reasonable opportunity to ask
questions and plan for the  
update. We request public comment on the minimum time prior to an
anticipated implementation  
of an updated standard or implementation specification version update
that should be considered  
reasonable for purposes of allowing customers, especially health care
providers using the Health  
IT Module in their health care delivery operations, to adequately plan
for potential implications  
of the update for their operations and their exchange relationships. We
would also be interested  
to know if commenters believe that there are specific certification
criteria, standards,  
characteristics of the certified Health IT Module or its implementation
(such as locally hosted by  
the customer using it versus software-as-a-service type of
implementation), or specific types or  
characteristics of customers that could affect the minimum advance
notice that should be

Health IT Modules the  
ONC-ACB has certified, and propose to require in the Principles of
Proper Conduct for ONC-  
ACBs that they are ultimately responsible for this information being
made publicly available on  
the CHPL. We request public comment on any additional information about
updated standards  
versions that may be beneficial to have listed with certified Health IT
Modules on the CHPL.

the updated  
standards versions approved by the National Coordinator for use in
certification through the

Standards Version Advancement Process the developer seeks to include in
its updated certified  
Health IT Module and would be able to do so on an itemized basis. In
other words, if the  
National Coordinator were to approve for use through the Standards
Version Advancement  
Process several different new versions of adopted standards that
affected different certification  
criteria within the scope of a certified Health IT Module, the developer
would be able to just  
update one certification criterion to one or more of the applicable new
standards and would not

at once in order to be able to take advantage of this proposed

*Health IT Developers Presenting a New Health IT Module for
Certification and*  
*Leveraging the Standards Version Advancement Process*  
  
In instances where a health IT developer presents a Health IT Module for
certification for  
which no prior certificate can serve as the basis for using the
Standards Version Advancement  
Process, we propose that the health IT developer would be permitted to
use and implement any  
and all of the newer versions of adopted standards the National
Coordinator approves through the  
Standards Version Advancement Process. We have implemented this proposed
policy through  
necessary adjustments to the way in which ONC-ACBs process
certifications in § 170.550. We  
recognize that this proposed flexibility reflects certain programmatic
and policy trade-offs. On  
one hand, a health IT developer would be permitted to use the most
recent version of standards  
approved by the National Coordinator instead of having to build in
potentially “outdated”  
standards just to get certified. On the other hand, the Program’s
testing infrastructure (which is  
now inclusive of government- developed and non-government-developed
tools) may experience  
certain lag times in terms of when updated test tools to support the
approved version

advancements would be available to test Health IT Modules for
certification purposes. As a  
result, we propose to provide the ability for ONC-ACBs to accept a
developer self-declaration of  
conformity as to the use, implementation, and conformance to a newer
version of a standard  
(including but not limited to implementation specifications) as
sufficient demonstration of  
conformance in circumstances where the National Coordinator has approved
a version update of  
a standard for use in certification through the Standards Version
Advancement Process but an  
associated testing tool is not yet updated to test to the newer version.
Again, we clarify that a  
health IT developer would be able to choose which National
Coordinator-approved standard  
version(s) it seeks to include in a new or updated certified Health IT
Module and would be able  
to do so on an itemized basis.  
On balance, we believe that this programmatic flexibility and the
potential  
interoperability improvements from the use of newer versions of
standards outweighs the  
subsequent oversight challenges. Moreover, these oversight challenges
can be mitigated by the  
Standards Version Advancement Process itself (i.e., the National
Coordinator not approving a  
new version if the Program or industry is not ready) and the
corresponding Conditions of  
Certification that continue with the use of National
Coordinator-approved new versions of  
adopted standards. We also believe that this approach will continue to
hold developers  
accountable for, and shift the focus of Health IT Module performance
demonstration to, real  
world testing for interoperability for deployed Health IT Modules. As
described above, we  
understand the limitations of test methods used prior to certification
and further emphasize the  
importance of continued conformance of Health IT Modules in the field.
However, we request  
comment on specific Program impacts we should consider.

*General Requirements Associated with Health IT Modules Certified using
the Standards  
Version Advancement Process  
  
*In all cases, regardless of whether a health IT developer is updating
an existing certified  
Health IT Module or presenting a new Health IT Module for certification
to new versions of  
adopted standards approved by the National Coordinator through the
Standards Version  
Advancement Process, it would need to adhere to the following once it
elects to takes advantage  
of this proposed flexibility:  
• The developer would need to ensure its mandatory disclosures in §
170.523(k)(1)  
appropriately reflect its use of any National Coordinator-approved newer
versions of  
standards.  
• The developer would need to address and adhere to all Conditions of
Certification and  
Maintenance of Certification requirements proposed that are otherwise be
applicable to its  
certified Health IT Modules regardless of whether those Health IT
Modules were certified to  
the exact same versions of adopted standards that are listed in the text
of 45 CFR part 170 or  
National Coordinator-approved newer version(s) of the standard(s). For
instance, the  
developer would need to ensure that its real world testing plan and
performance included the  
National Coordinator-approved standards versions to which it is claiming
conformance.  
In terms of compliance with the real world testing Condition and
Maintenance of  
Certification requirements, the attestations Condition and Maintenance
of Certification  
requirements proposed in § 170.406, and for the purposes of ONC-ACB
surveillance, we note  
that health IT developers would be accountable for maintaining all
applicable certified Health IT  
Modules in accordance with approved versions of standards and
implementation specifications  
that they voluntarily elect to use in their certified health IT. If, at
any point after initial

certification or updated certification for a Health IT Module using the
National Coordinator  
approved advanced versions of standards or implementation
specifications, real world testing  
results do not demonstrate the Health IT Module’s conformance to each
applicable certification  
criterion had been achieved and maintained using the National
Coordinator approved advanced  
version update of any applicable standard(s) and implementation
specification(s), then the  
developer would not be allowed to claim or characterize the Health IT
Module as conformant to  
the criterion using such standard version, and the standard or
implementation specification  
version could not be indicated in the health IT Module’s CHPL record as
supported by any  
version release of the Health IT Module, until such time as they could
demonstrate through  
ONC-ATL or results of real world testing that they had successfully
upgraded the Health IT  
Module to fully conform to applicable certification criteria while
incorporating the more  
advanced version of the standard. Non-conformities associated with the
use of new versions of  
National Coordinator-approved standards would be found and enforced
through the same  
Program rules just like they would be for non-conformities with the
versions of adopted  
standards that are codified in regulation text. Further, we remind
health IT developers that they  
would be required to make an attestation to their real world testing
results, including (though not  
limited to) those that would be used to support use of new versions of
National Coordinator-  
approved standards.  
*Advanced Version Approval Approach*  
Once a standard has been adopted for use in the Program through notice
and comment  
rulemaking, ONC would undertake an annual, open and transparent process,
including  
opportunity for public comment, to timely ascertain whether a more
recent version of that

standard or implementation specification should be approved for
developers’ voluntary use.  
ONC would identify updated versions of previously adopted standards and
implementation  
specifications based on our own monitoring of market trends and
interoperability needs, as well  
as input received from external stakeholders. Such external input may
include, but would not be  
limited to, recommendations made by the Health Information Technology
Advisory Committee  
as well as input received from SDOs.  
ONC expects to use an expanded section of the Interoperability Standards
Advisory  
(ISA) web platform to facilitate the public transparency and engagement
process. At a particular  
time of the year (e.g., early fall), ONC would post a list of new
versions of adopted standards and  
implementation specifications that appear timely and appropriate for use
within the Program (for  
the subsequent calendar year) along with accompanying descriptive
context (e.g., the  
types/nature of updates in the new version of a standard). ONC would
then widely communicate  
to all members of the public that the list was available and make a
general solicitation of  
comments to any and all interested parties for a period of 30 to 60
days. We would generally  
expect to receive comments on a range of issues related to the version
of the standard under  
consideration, including its availability, testing tools, maturity,
implementation burden, and  
overall impact on interoperability. Health IT developers, health
information networks (HINs),  
and the health care organizations that purchase and use health IT are
already familiar with the  
process of commenting through our existing ISA resource and we believe
this process is well  
suited to support widespread engagement by all stakeholders. Similar to
the ISA, we would  
expect to be open to receiving comments on newer versions of adopted
standards throughout the  
year leading up to the formal comment period.

<span id="296"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **296** of **724**  
  
Once the formal comment period closes, ONC would review the comments and
consider  
the potential impacts of a new version an adopted standard or
implementation specification. We  
anticipate approving newer versions of adopted standards and
implementation specifications  
based on several interdependent Program and market factors, such as its
ability to enhance  
interoperability and overall compatibility with other adopted versions,
how burdensome it would  
be to update to the newer version and the scope and scale of the
changes, whether the new  
version would be required for reporting by a corresponding program
(e.g., CMS or CDC), the  
availability of test tools for the new version, and the new version’s
relationship to other adopted  
standards and any dependencies. Upon concluding our review and analysis,
ONC would publish  
in this new ISA section a final list of National Coordinator-approved
advanced versions that  
health IT developers could electively use consistent with the Standards
Version Advancement  
Process.  
Within this proposed approach, we expect that when it comes to a
standard, the National  
Coordinator would identify version updates to an adopted standard
consistent with that  
standard’s name and version track. This method would provide long-term
consistency for health  
IT developers in terms of the overall technical conformance requirements
on which they will be  
focused.  
With respect to adopted implementation specifications, we believe that
more flexibility  
about the precise name and version track identifiers would be warranted
given that  
implementation specifications are developed by market-driven industry
consortia (e.g., Argonaut  
project and Direct project stakeholders) as well as traditional SDOs.
Similarly, authors of  
implementation specifications sometimes develop supplemental documents
to the “parent”

implementation specification or split the implementation specification
to form newly titled  
materials. In any of these cases, the resulting implementation
specification may—on its face—  
initially appear to bear no relation to a previously adopted
implementation specification because  
of changes to its title, version naming, or numbering presentation. In
reality, in many of these  
cases, the implementation specification retains substantially the same
purpose(s) and thus  
represents a versioning update rather than amounting to a novel
specification. Accordingly,  
regardless of its title and author, the National Coordinator would take
into account whether any  
“new” implementation specification under consideration is more
accurately characterized as  
novel to the Program or instead is a derivative work that is
substantially a more advanced version  
of a previously adopted implementation specification(s). Stakeholders
would also be able to  
comment on the same during the advanced version approval process
described here.  
The public listing of these National Coordinator determinations to
approve version  
updates to already adopted standards and implementation specifications
would serve as the  
single, comprehensive, and authoritative index of the versions of
adopted standards and  
implementation specifications available for use under the Program. We
note, however, that  
certain Program administration steps would need to occur (such as
ONC-ACBs expanding the  
scope of their accreditations) after the National Coordinator has
approved newer versions of  
adopted standards. As a result, there would likely be a temporary delay
between the National  
Coordinator’s approval decision and when certification to new standards
versions under the  
Program would start.  
We welcome comments on any and all aspects of our proposed standards
version  
approval process as an option available to developers through
maintenance requirements as part

of the real world testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification.
This includes all aspects of  
our described approach to standards and implementation specification
advanced version approval  
processes. We also invite comments on our proposal to allow in
conjunction with this  
maintenance flexibility the opportunity for developers to elect to
present health IT for initial  
testing and certification either to more advanced versions or the prior
versions included in  
regulatory text as of the date the technology is presented.  
*Principle of Proper Conduct for ONC-ACB for all Real World Testing
Proposals*  
We propose to include a new Principle of Proper Conduct for ONC-ACBs in
§  
170.523(p) that would require ONC-ACBs to review and confirm that
applicable health IT  
developers submit real world testing plans and results in accordance
with our proposals. We  
expect that ONC-ACBs would review the plans for completeness. Once
completeness is  
confirmed, ONC-ACBs would provide the plans to ONC by December 15 and
results to ONC by  
April 1. The December 15 date is the same date as the health IT
developer requirement for  
submission of the real world testing plan. For purposes of the Program,
this treats both regulated  
entities equally and permits them to work out a process that ensures all
real world testing plans  
are submitted to the CHPL by December 15. For example, a health IT
developer that is confident  
in its plan and does not anticipate any further certification, may
submit its plan in July of the  
preceding year.  
The submission of results, however, does not present the same dynamic of
the potential  
need to work together to ensure the plan is complete. As such, we have
proposed different dates.  
We would expect the developers to submit their results by January 31. We
believe this would  
provide sufficient time for ONC-ACBs to review all plans and post them
to the CHPL by April  
****  
**NOTICE**

1, including notifying ONC when the results were not in compliance with
requirements. ONC  
would make both the plans and results publicly available via the CHPL.
We note that ONC-  
ACBs will continue to be required to perform in-the-field surveillance
of certified Health IT  
Modules and results of real world testing could be considered
information to inform ONC-ACB  
surveillance activities.  
Because we are proposing to allow health IT developers to implement
National  
Coordinator-approved advanced versions of standards and implementation
specifications in  
certified Health IT Modules through a developer self-declaration of
conformity presented for  
certification if an associated testing tool is not yet updated to test
to the newer version for the  
standards and implementation specification version updates they have
chosen to use in the  
Program, we propose two requirements to ensure the public and ONC-ACBs
have knowledge of  
the version of a standard that certified health IT meets. First, we
propose to revise the Principle  
of Proper Conduct in § 170.523(m) to require ONC-ACBs to collect, no
less than quarterly, all  
version updates made to standards successfully included in certified
health IT per the  
requirements within the real world testing Condition of Certification
Standards Version  
Advancement Process. This would ensure that ONC-ACBs are aware of the
version of a standard  
that certified health IT meets for the purposes of surveillance and
Program administration.  
Second, we propose (as discussed above), that a developer that chooses
to avail itself of the  
Standards Version Advancement Process flexibility must address in its
real world testing plans  
and results submissions the timeline and rollout of applicable version
updates for standards and  
implementation specifications. This addition to § 170.523(m) along with
existing requirements  
for weekly ONC-ACB CHPL reporting to versions of standards per §
170.523(f)(1)(xvii) would

<span id="300"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **300** of **724**  
  
allow for timely updates to Health IT Module certificate information in
the CHPL. Together with  
the requirements (discussed above) for developers’ communication with
their current and  
potential customers, we intend to ensure that the public and end-users
have transparency into  
planned and actual standards and implementation specifications updates
for their certified health  
IT.  
In complement to the above requirements to ensure transparency for the
public and end  
users, we propose in § 170.523(t) a new Principle of Proper Conduct for
ONC-ACBs requiring  
them to ensure that developers seeking to take advantage of the
Standards Version Advancement  
Process flexibility in § 170.405(b)(5) comply with the applicable
requirements, and that the  
ONC-ACB both retain records of the timing and content of developers’ §
170.405(b)(5) notices  
and timely post each notice’s content publicly on the CHPL attributed to
the certified Health IT  
Modules to which it applies.  
We seek comment on the proposed additions to the Principles of Proper
Conduct for  
ONC-ACBs. More specifically, we seek comment on whether ONC-ACBs should
be required to  
perform an evaluation beyond a completeness check for the real world
testing plans and results  
and the value versus the burden of such an endeavor.  
6\. Attestations  
****  
The **** Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition
and Maintenance of  
Certification under the Program, provide to the Secretary an attestation
to all the Conditions of  
Certification specified in the Cures Act, except for the “EHR reporting
criteria submission”  
Condition of Certification. We propose to implement the Cures Act
“attestations” requirements  
Condition of Certification in § 170.406. We also propose that, as part
of the implementation of

<span id="301"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **301** of **724**  
  
this statutory provision, health IT developers would attest, as
applicable, to compliance with the  
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements described in
this section of the  
preamble and proposed in §§ 170.401 through 170.405.  
  
We propose that, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement for the
“attestations”  
Condition of Certification, health IT developers must submit their
attestations every 6 months  
(i.e., semiannually). We believe this would provide an appropriate
“attestation period” to base  
any enforcement actions, such as by ONC under the Program or by the
Office of the Inspector  
General under its Cures Act authority. We also believe this 6-month
attestation period properly  
balances the need to support appropriate enforcement actions with the
attestation burden placed  
on developers. We will determine when the first attestation will be due
depending on when the  
final rule is published. We require attestations to be due twice a year,
likely in the middle and  
end of the calendar year.  
  
The process we plan to implement for providing attestations should
minimize burden on  
health IT developers. First, we propose to provide a 14-day attestation
period twice a year. For  
health IT developers presenting health IT for certification for the
first time under the Program,  
we propose that they would be required to submit an attestation at the
time of certification and  
then also comply with the semiannual attestation periods. Second, we
would publicize and  
prompt developers to complete their attestation during the required
attestation periods. Third, we  
propose to provide a method for health IT developers to indicate their
compliance, non-  
compliance with, or the inapplicability of each Condition and
Maintenance of Certification  
requirement as it applies to all of their health IT certified under the
Program for each attestation  
period. Last, we propose to provide health IT developers the flexibility
to specify non-

<span id="302"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **302** of **724**  
  
compliance per certified Health IT Module, if necessary. We note,
however, that any non-  
compliance with the proposed Conditions and Maintenance of Certification
requirements,  
including the “attestations” Conditions and Maintenance of Certification
requirements, would be  
subject to ONC direct review, corrective action, and enforcement
procedures under the Program.  
We refer readers to section VII.D of this preamble for discussion of
proposed ONC direct  
review, corrective action, and enforcement procedures for the Conditions
and Maintenance of  
Certification requirements under the Program.  
  
We propose that attestations would be submitted to ONC-ACBs on behalf of
ONC and  
the Secretary. We propose that ONC-ACBs would have two responsibilities
related to  
attestations. One responsibility we propose in § 170.523(q) is that an
ONC-ACB must review  
and submit the health IT developers’ attestations to ONC. ONC would then
make the attestations  
publicly available through the CHPL. The other responsibility we propose
in § 170.550(l) is that  
before issuing a certification, an ONC-ACB would need to ensure that the
health IT developer of  
the Health IT Module has met its responsibilities related to the
Conditions and Maintenance of  
Certification requirements as solely evidenced by its attestation. For
example, if a health IT  
developer with an active certification under the Program indicated
non-compliant designations in  
their attestation but is already participating in a corrective action
plan under ONC direct review  
to resolve the non-compliance, certification would be able to proceed
while the issue is being  
resolved.  
  
We welcome comments on the proposed attestations Condition and
Maintenance of  
Certification requirements, including the appropriate frequency and
timing of attestations. We

<span id="303"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **303** of **724**  
  
also welcome comments on the proposed responsibilities for ONC-ACBs
related to the  
attestations of Condition and Maintenance of Certification
requirements.  
7\. EHR Reporting Criteria Submission  
  
The Cures Act specifies that health IT developers be required, as a
Condition and  
Maintenance of Certification under the Program, to submit reporting
criteria on certified health  
IT in accordance with the EHR reporting program established under
section 3009A of the PHSA,  
as added by the Cures Act. We have not yet established an EHR reporting
program. Once ONC  
establishes such program, we will undertake future rulemaking to propose
and implement the  
associated Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement(s) for
health IT developers. ****  
*C. Compliance*  
The proposed Maintenance of Certification requirements discussed above
do not  
necessarily define all the outcomes necessary to meet the Conditions of
Certification. Rather,  
they provide preliminary or baseline evidence toward measuring whether a
Condition is being  
met. Thus, ONC could determine that a Condition of Certification is not
being met through  
reasons other than the Maintenance of Certification requirements. For
example, meeting the  
proposed Maintenance of Certification requirement that requires a health
IT developer to not  
establish or enforce any contract or agreement that contravenes the
Communications Condition  
of Certification does not excuse a health IT developer from meeting all
the requirements  
specified in the proposed Communications Condition of Certification.
This is analogous to  
clarifications ONC has previously provided about certification criteria
requirements whereby  
testing prior to certification sometimes only tests a subset of the full
criterion’s intended  
functions and scope. However, for compliance and surveillance purposes,
we have stated that  
****

<span id="304"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **304** of **724**  
  
ONC and its ONC-ACBs will examine whether the certified health IT meets
the full scope of the  
certification criterion rather than the subset of functions it was
tested against (80 FR 62709-10).  
*D. Enforcement*  
The Cures Act affirms ONC’s role in using certification to improve
health IT’s  
capabilities for the access, use, and exchange of electronic health
information. The Cures Act  
provides this affirmation through expanded certification authority for
ONC to establish  
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements for health IT
developers that go  
beyond the certified health IT itself. The new Conditions and
Maintenance of Certification  
provisions in section 4002 of the Cures Act focus on the actions and
business practices of health  
IT developers (e.g., information blocking and appropriate access, use,
and exchange of electronic  
health information) as well as technical interoperability of health IT
(e.g., APIs and real world  
testing). Furthermore and equally important, section 4002 of the Cures
Act provides that the  
Secretary of HHS may encourage compliance with the Conditions and
Maintenance of  
Certification requirements and take action to discourage noncompliance.
As discussed in the  
2015 Edition final rule, ONC is not limited to enforcing Program
compliance solely through  
those requirements expressed in certification criteria adopted under the
Program (80 FR 62710;  
see also 81 FR 72412). Certification under the Program also relies on a
health IT developer’s  
compliance with Program requirements that ensure the basic integrity and
effectiveness of the  
Program, which is further stressed through the addition of the
Conditions and Maintenance of  
Certification requirements in the Cures Act (referred to jointly as the
“Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification” in this section of the preamble).

Given these considerations, we propose a general enforcement approach
outlining a  
corrective action process for ONC to review potential or known instances
where a Condition or  
Maintenance of Certification requirement has not been or is not being
met by a health IT  
developer under the Program, including the requirement for a health IT
developer to attest to  
meeting the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification. Table 3 below
provides an overview of  
the proposed approach to ONC enforcement of the Conditions and
Maintenance of Certification.

1\. ONC Direct Review of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification
Requirements  
  
We propose to utilize the processes previously established for ONC
direct review of  
certified health IT in the EOA final rule (81 FR 72404) and codified in
§§ 170.580 and 170.581  
for the enforcement of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification.
We propose this  
approach for multiple reasons. First, these processes were established
to address non-

conformities with Program requirements. Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification are  
proposed to be adopted as Program requirements and, as such, any
noncompliance with the  
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification would constitute a Program
non-conformity.  
Second, health IT developers are familiar with the ONC direct review
provisions as they were  
established in October 2016. Third, §§ 170.580 and 170.581 provide
thorough and transparent  
processes for working with health IT developers through notice and
corrective action to remedy  
Program non-conformities. Last, the direct review framework provides
equitable opportunities  
for health IT developers to respond to ONC actions and appeal certain
ONC determinations.  
  
2\. Review and Enforcement Only by ONC  
  
We propose to retain use of the term “direct review” as previously
adopted in the EOA  
final rule to continue to distinguish actions ONC takes to directly
review certified health IT or  
health IT developers’ actions in comparison to an ONC-ACB’s review of
certified health IT  
under surveillance. We propose, however, that ONC would be the sole
party responsible for  
enforcing compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification. The Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification focus on health IT developer behavior and
actions in addition to the  
certified Health IT Module. ONC is more familiar with the behavioral
requirements based on its  
expertise and experience. Conversely, ONC-ACBs are generally more
suited, based on their  
accreditation and current responsibilities, to address non-conformities
with technical and other  
Program requirements. ONC also has the necessary resources and the
ability to coordinate with  
other agencies to enforce the Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification, such as with the  
“information blocking” Condition of Certification (proposed § 170.401).
Further, ONC  
enforcement would provide more predictability and consistency, which
would likely benefit

stakeholders in matters related to API fees and information blocking. We
do, however, discuss  
below the scope of ONC-ACB surveillance as it relates to ONC’s proposed
enforcement of the  
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification.  
  
3\. Review Processes  
  
We propose to substantially adopt the processes as they are currently
codified in §§  
170.580 and 170.581 for ONC’s review and enforcement of the Conditions
and Maintenance of  
Certification, but propose certain revisions and additions to the
processes to properly incorporate  
the proposed Conditions and Maintenance of Certification and effectuate
Congressional intent.  
These revisions and additions include renaming and restructuring
headings for clarity, which we  
do not discuss below.  
  
a. Initiating Review and Health IT Developer Notice  
We propose to fully incorporate the review of the Conditions and
Maintenance of  
Certification into the provisions of § 170.580(a) and (b). We propose in
§ 170.580(a)(iii) that if  
ONC has a reasonable belief that a health IT developer has not complied
with a Condition of  
Certification, then it *may* initiate direct review. Similarly, we
propose in § 170.580(b)(1) and (2)  
that ONC may issue the health IT developer a notice of potential
non-conformity or notice of  
non-conformity and provide the health IT developer an opportunity to
respond with an  
explanation and written documentation, including any information ONC
requests. These  
processes, including relevant timeframes, are specified in §
170.580(b).  
i. Complaint Resolution  
We note and recommend that customers and end-users first work with their
health IT  
developers to resolve any issues of potential non-compliance with the
Conditions and

<span id="308"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **308** of **724**  
  
Maintenance of Certification as prior Program experience has shown that
many issues can be  
resolved at this step. If the issue cannot be resolved, we then
recommend the end-user contact the  
ONC-ACB. However, as discussed above and in section VII.D.5 below, the
ONC-ACB purview  
for certified health IT generally applies to certified capabilities and
limited requirements of  
developer business practices. If neither of these pathways resolves the
issue, end-users may  
provide feedback to ONC via the Health IT Feedback
Form.[98](ONCs.html#308)  
  
  
ii. Method of Correspondence with Health IT Developers  
Section 170.505 states that correspondence and communication with ONC or
the  
National Coordinator shall be conducted by email, unless otherwise
necessary or specified. In the  
EOA final rule, we signaled our intent to send notices of potential
non-conformity, non-  
conformity, suspension, proposed termination, and termination via
certified mail (81 FR 72429).  
However, in accordance with § 170.505, we propose that email should be
the default mode of  
correspondence for direct review of non-compliance with the Conditions
and Maintenance of  
Certification.  
Under the EOA final rule, ONC can initiate direct review of certified
health IT in limited  
circumstances, namely when there is a reasonable belief that the
certified health IT may be  
causing or contributing to serious risks to public health or safety or
suspected non-conformities  
present practical challenges that may prevent an ONC-ACB from
effectively investigating or  
responding to the suspected non-conformity. In contrast, we propose in
this proposed rule to  
enable ONC to initiate direct review to address a health IT developer’s
conduct under the  
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements in addition to
non-conformities in

certified health IT. This proposal would create an expanded set of
circumstances for ONC to  
conduct direct review. Accordingly, the type and extent of review by ONC
could vary  
significantly based on the complexity and severity of each fact pattern.
For instance, ONC may  
be able to address certain non-conformities under the Conditions and
Maintenance of  
Certification quickly and with minimal effort (e.g., failure to make
public a documentation  
hyperlink), while others may be more complex and require additional time
and effort (e.g.,  
violation of API fee prohibitions). Considering this wide range of
potential non-conformities  
under the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification, we believe it is
appropriate for ONC to  
retain discretion to decide, on a case-by-case basis, when to go beyond
the provisions of §  
170.505 in providing notices and correspondence for non-compliance with
the Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification.  
We solicit comment on the nature and types of non-conformities with the
Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification requirements that ONC should consider in
determining the method  
of correspondence. We also solicit comment on whether the type of notice
should affect the  
method of correspondence and whether certain types of notices under
direct review should be  
considered more critical than others, thus requiring a specific method
of correspondence.  
b. Relationship with ONC-ACBs and ONC-ATLs  
Section 170.580(a)(3) outlines ONC direct review in relation to the
roles of ONC-ACBs  
and ONC-ATLs, which we propose to revise to incorporate Conditions and
Maintenance of  
Certification. We note that we provide situational examples below in
section VII.D.5 “Effect on  
Existing Program Requirements and Processes” regarding ONC direct review
and the role of an  
ONC-ACB. As finalized in the EOA final rule and per § 170.580(a)(3)(v),
we remind readers

that ONC may refer the applicable part of its review of certified health
IT to the relevant ONC-  
ACB(s) if ONC determines this would serve the effective administration
or oversight of the  
Program (81 FR 72427-72428).  
c. Records Access  
  
We propose to revise § 170.580(b)(3) to ensure that ONC, or third
parties acting on its  
behalf, has access to the information necessary to enforce the
Conditions and Maintenance of  
Certification. As specified in § 170.580(b)(1)(ii)(A)(*2*),
(b)(2)(ii)(A)(*2*) and (b)(3), in response to  
a notice of potential non-conformity or notice of non-conformity, ONC
must be granted access  
to, and have the ability to share within HHS, with other federal
agencies, and with appropriate  
entities, all of a health IT developers’ records and technology related
to the development, testing,  
certification, implementation, maintenance, and use of a health IT
developers’ certified health  
IT; and any complaint records related to the certified health IT.
“Complaint records” include, but  
are not limited to issue logs and help desk tickets (81 FR 72431). We
propose to supplement  
these requirements with a requirement that a health IT developer make
available to ONC, and  
third parties acting on its behalf, records related to marketing and
distribution, communications,  
contracts, and any other information relevant to compliance with any of
the Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification or other Program requirements. This
information would assist in  
reviewing allegations that a health IT developer violated, for example,
the “prohibit and restrict  
communications” Condition of Certification. Further, it is possible that
multiple Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification may be implicated under a review, and thus
ONC believes it is  
appropriate to require a developer make available to ONC *all* records
and other relevant  
****

<span id="311"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **311** of **724**  
  
information concerning all the Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification and Program  
requirements to which it and its Health IT Modules are subject.  
  
If ONC determined that a health IT developer was not cooperative with
the fact-finding  
process, we propose ONC would have the ability to issue a certification
ban and/or terminate a  
certificate (*see* proposed § 170.581 discussed below and §
170.580(f)(1)(iii)(A)(*1*)).  
  
We understand that health IT developers may have concerns regarding the
disclosure of  
proprietary, trade secret, competitively sensitive, or other
confidential information. As we stated  
in the EOA final rule (81 FR 72429), ONC would implement appropriate
safeguards to ensure, to  
the extent permissible with federal law, that any proprietary business
information or trade secrets  
ONC may encounter by accessing the health IT developer’s records, other
information, or  
technology, would be kept confidential by ONC or any third parties
working on behalf of ONC.  
However, a health IT developer would not be able to avoid providing ONC
access to relevant  
records by asserting that such access would require it to disclose trade
secrets or other  
proprietary or confidential information. Therefore, health IT developers
must clearly mark, as  
described in HHS Freedom of Information Act regulations at 45 CFR
5.65(c), any information  
they regard as trade secret or confidential commercial or financial
information which they seek  
to keep confidential prior to disclosing the information to ONC or any
third party working on  
behalf of ONC.  
  
d. Corrective Action  
We propose that if ONC determines that a health IT developer is
noncompliant with a  
Condition of Certification (i.e., a non-conformity), ONC would work with
the health IT  
developer to establish a corrective action plan (CAP) to remedy the
issue through the processes

specified in § 170.580(b)(2)(ii)(A)(*4*) and (c). We note that a health
IT developer may be in  
noncompliance with more than one Condition of Certification. In such
cases, ONC will follow  
the proposed compliance enforcement process for each Condition of
Certification accordingly,  
but may also require the health IT developer to address all violations
in one CAP for efficiency  
of process. We also propose, as we currently do with CAPs for certified
health IT, to list health  
IT developers under a CAP on ONC’s website.  
  
  
e. Certification Ban and Termination  
We propose in § 170.581 that if a health IT developer under ONC direct
review for non-  
compliance with a Condition of Certification failed to work with ONC or
was otherwise  
noncompliant with the requirements of the CAP and/or CAP process, ONC
could issue a  
certification ban for the health IT developer (and its subsidiaries and
successors). A certification  
ban, as it currently does for other matters under § 170.581, would
prohibit prospective  
certification activity by the health IT developer.  
ONC would also consider termination[99](ONCs.html#312) of the
certificate(s) of the affected Health IT  
Module(s) should the health IT developer fail to work with ONC or is
otherwise noncompliant  
with the requirements of the CAP and/or CAP process (*see* proposed §
170.580(f)(1)(iii)). ONC  
may consider termination if there is a nexus between the developer’s
actions or business  
practices and certified Health IT Module(s) (*see* proposed §
170.580(f)(1)(iii)). For example,  
ONC may determine that a health IT developer is violating a Condition of
Certification due to a  
clause in its contracts that prevents its users from sharing or
discussing technological  
  
99 As noted in the EOA final rule, “termination” means an ONC action to
“terminate” or “revoke” the certification  
status of a Complete EHR or Health IT Module. (81 FR 72443)

impediments to information exchange. In this example, the health IT
developer’s conduct would  
violate the “prohibiting or restricting communication” Condition of
Certification proposed in §  
170.403. If the same conduct were also found to impair the functionality
of the certified Health  
IT Module (such as by preventing the proper use of certified
capabilities for the exchange of  
EHI), ONC may determine that a nexus exists between the developer’s
business practices and the  
functionality of the certified Health IT Module, and may consider
termination of the certificates  
of that particular Health IT Module under the proposed approach.  
We propose this approach, which allows ONC to initiate a certification
ban and/or  
certificate termination under certain circumstances, to ensure that
health IT developers are acting  
in accordance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification.
However, we stress that our  
first and foremost priority is to work with health IT developers to
remedy any noncompliance  
with Conditions and Maintenance of Certification through a corrective
action process before  
taking further action. This emphasizes ONC’s desire to promote and
support health IT developer  
compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification and
ensure that certified health  
IT is compliant with Program requirements in order to foster an
environment where EHI is  
exchanged in an interoperable way.  
ONC does not believe that noncompliance with a Condition of
Certification should  
always result in the termination of the certificate of one or more of a
developer’s Health IT  
Modules for a few reasons. A violation of a Condition of Certification
may relate solely to health  
IT developer business practices or actions that do not affect the Health
IT Module’s conformance  
to the requirements of the certification criteria. In this case,
termination of the certification could  
unfairly and negatively affect a provider’s ability to use the Health IT
Module for participation in

CMS programs that require certification because the Health IT Module
itself is functioning in  
accordance with the technical requirements of its
certificate.[100](ONCs.html#314)As such, ONC would carefully  
consider on a case-by-case basis the appropriateness of termination of a
Health IT Module’s  
certification(s) based on the specific circumstances of the
noncompliance with the Condition of  
Certification. The proposed enforcement approach balances the above
stated goals and provides  
an outlined process that can be consistently followed.  
In considering whether termination of a Health IT Module’s
certificate(s) and/or a  
certification ban is appropriate, ONC will consider factors including,
but not limited to: whether  
the health IT developer has previously been found in noncompliance with
the Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification or other Program requirements; the severity
and pervasiveness of  
the noncompliance, including the effect of the noncompliance on
widespread interoperability and  
health information exchange; the extent to which the health IT developer
cooperates with ONC  
to review the noncompliance; the extent of potential negative impact on
providers who may seek  
to use the certified health IT to participate in CMS programs; and
whether termination and/or a  
certification ban is necessary to ensure the integrity of the
certification process.  
As under § 170.580(f)(2), ONC would provide notice of the termination to
the health IT  
developer, including providing reasons for, and information supporting,
the termination and  
instructions for appealing the termination. We propose to add similar
notice provisions to §  
170.581 for certification bans issued under ONC direct review for
non-compliance with the  
  
100 Note that, in this example, an ONC-ACB may investigate the technical
functionalities of the Health IT Module  
against its certificate and perform surveillance under § 170.556
separate from ONC’s process to enforce compliance  
with the Conditions of Certification. If under ONC-ACB surveillance, a
health IT developer does not adequately or  
timely fulfill a corrective action plan, the ONC-ACB may suspend and
withdraw the Health IT Module’s certificate.  
The expectations of ONC-ACB duties as relates to ONC’s enforcement of
the conditions of certification are  
described further in the preamble.

Conditions and Maintenance of Certification, which would also include
instructions for  
requesting reinstatement. In this regard, we propose to apply the
current reinstatement  
procedures under § 170.581 to Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification bans, but with an  
additional requirement that the health IT developer has resolved the
non-compliance with the  
Condition of Certification. In sum, a health IT developer could seek
ONC’s approval to re-enter  
the Program and have the certification ban lifted if it demonstrates it
has resolved the  
noncompliance with the Condition of Certification and ONC is satisfied
that all affected  
customers have been provided appropriate remediation.  
For clarity, a health IT developer would have an opportunity to appeal
an ONC  
determination to issue a certification ban and/or termination IT
resulting from a non-conformity  
with a Condition of Certification as discussed below and/or seek
reinstatement in the Program  
and have the certification ban lifted. To note, we propose to make
terminations effective  
consistent with current § 170.580(f)(2)(iii) and similarly for
certification bans (*see* proposed §  
170.581(c)). We seek comment on whether ONC should:  
• Impose a minimum certification ban length before a health IT developer
can request  
ONC remove the ban for health IT developers who are noncompliant with a
Condition of  
Certification more than once (e.g., a minimum six months for two
instances, a minimum  
of one year for three instances).  
• Consider additional factors for a certification ban and/or the
termination of a health IT  
developer’s certified health IT resulting from a non-conformity with a
Condition of  
Certification.

<span id="316"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **316** of **724**  
  
  
We propose to provide a health IT developer an opportunity to appeal an
ONC  
determination to issue a certification ban and/or termination resulting
from a non-conformity  
with a Condition of Certification and would follow the processes
specified in § 170.580(g). As  
such, we propose to revise § 170.580(g) to include ONC direct review of
the Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification.  
  
  
g. Suspension  
  
Section 170.580 includes a process for suspending the certification of a
Health IT Module  
at any time if ONC has a reasonable belief that the certified health IT
may present a serious risk  
to public health and safety. While this will remain the case for
certified health IT under ONC  
direct review (i.e., suspension of certification is always available
under ONC direct review when  
the certified health IT presents a serious risk to public health and
safety), we do not believe such  
circumstances would apply to noncompliance with the Conditions of
Certification. Further, we  
believe the more streamlined processes proposed for addressing
noncompliance with Conditions  
and Maintenance of Certification alleviates the need to proceed through
a suspension process.  
Therefore, we do not propose to apply the suspension processes under §
170.580 to our review of  
the Conditions of Certification. We welcome comments on this proposal,
including reasons for  
why we should apply suspension processes to the Conditions of
Certification as part of a  
subsequent final rule.  
  
  
h. Proposed Termination  
  
Section 170.580 includes an intermediate step between a developer
failing to take  
appropriate and timely corrective action and termination of a certified
Health IT Module’s  
certificate, called “proposed termination” (*see* § 170.580(e) and 81 FR
72437)). We propose to

*not* include this step when a health IT developer fails to take
appropriate and timely corrective  
action for noncompliance with a Condition of Certification. Rather, as
discussed above, ONC  
may proceed directly to issuing a certification ban or notice of
termination if it determines a  
certification ban and/or termination are appropriate per the
considerations discussed above. The  
Conditions and Maintenance of Certification include requirements of
developer business  
practices and actions for which, as previously discussed, noncompliance
with the Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification in these arenas are likely to undermine the
integrity of the Program  
and impede widespread interoperability and information exchange. As
such, ONC believes it is  
appropriate and consistent with the Cures Act to proceed immediately to
a certification ban  
and/or termination of the affected certified Health IT Modules’
certificates if a developer does  
not take appropriate and timely corrective action. A certification ban
and/or termination are  
appropriate disincentives for noncompliance with the Conditions and
Maintenance of  
Certification.

We propose to publicly list health IT developers and certified Health IT
Modules on  
ONC’s website that are subject to a certification ban and/or have been
terminated, respectively,  
for noncompliance with a Condition of Certification or for reasons
already specified in §  
170.581. We currently take this same approach for health IT with
terminated certifications (*see*  
81 FR 72438). Public listing serves to discourage noncompliance with
Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification, other Program requirements, remediation of
non-conformities, and  
cooperation with ONC and the ONC-ACBs. It also serves to provide notice
to all ONC-ATLs,  
ONC-ACBs, public and private programs requiring the use of certified
health IT, and consumers

of certified health IT of the status of certified health IT and health
IT developers operating under  
the Program.  
We seek comment on this proposal, including input on the appropriate
period of time to  
list health IT developers and affected certified Health IT Modules on
healthit.gov. For example,  
if a developer sought and received reinstatement under the Program (and
lifting of the  
certification ban), should the health IT developer no longer be listed
on the ONC website?  
Alternatively, should we list health IT developers who have been subject
to the certification ban  
under § 170.581 for a certain period of time beyond the active ban,
including indefinitely (e.g.,  
with the timeframe when the ban was active)?  
  
  
5\. Effect on Existing Program Requirements and Processes  
The Cures Act introduces new Conditions and Maintenance of Certification
that  
encompass technical and functional requirements of health IT and new
actions and business  
practice requirements for health IT developers, which ONC proposes to
adopt in subpart D of  
Part 170. The pre-Cures Act structure and requirements of the Program
provide processes to  
enforce compliance with technical and functional requirements of
certified health IT, and to a  
more limited extent, requirements for the business practices of health
IT developers (see, e.g., 45  
CFR 170.523(k)(1)) under subparts C (Certification Criteria for Health
Information Technology)  
and E (ONC Health IT Certification Program) of Part 170. ONC-ACBs are
required to perform  
surveillance on certified Health IT Modules and may investigate reported
alleged non-  
conformities with Program requirements under subparts A, B, C, and E
with the ultimate goal to  
work with the health IT developer to correct the non-conformity. Under
certain situations, such  
as unsafe conditions or impediments to ONC-ACB oversight, ONC may
directly review certified

health IT to determine whether it conforms to the requirements of the
Program (*see* § 170.580  
and the EOA final rule at 81 FR 72404). These avenues for investigating
non-conformities with  
certified Health IT Modules will continue to exist under the Program and
generally focus on  
functionality and performance of certified health IT or more limited
requirements of business  
practices of health IT developers found in subparts A, B, C and E of
Part 170, respectively. Thus,  
there may be instances where one or more Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification are not  
being or have not been met that also relate to certified Health IT
Modules non-conformities  
under subparts A, B, C and E. Under these situations, ONC could in
parallel implement both sets  
of processes – existing processes to investigate Health IT Module
non-conformities and the  
proposed process to enforce compliance with the Conditions and
Maintenance of Certification.  
We again note that under the proposed enforcement approach, only ONC
would have the  
ability to determine whether a Condition or Maintenance of Certification
requirement per subpart  
D has been or is being met. We propose to delineate the scope of an
ONC-ACB’s requirements  
to perform surveillance on certified Health IT Modules as related only
to the requirements of  
subparts A, B, C and E of Part 170. Table 4 below further illustrates
the proposed difference in  
scope of review activities between ONC-ACBs and ONC. Given our proposed
approach that  
would authorize solely ONC to determine whether a Condition or
Maintenance of Certification  
requirement per subpart D has been or is being met, we propose to add a
new Principle of Proper  
Conduct for ONC-ACBs in § 170.523(s) that would require ONC-ACBs to
report to ONC, no  
later than a week after becoming aware, any information that could
inform whether ONC should  
exercise direct review for noncompliance with a Condition of
Certification or any matter within  
the scope of ONC direct review. We believe this is appropriate because
ONC-ACBs receive

For example and further illustration purposes, ONC may receive a

ability to receive secure  
Direct messages from users of a competing developer’s EHR. The complaint
alleges the certified  
health IT drops the incoming message without alerting the user that a
message was ever received.  
ONC would consider the information blocking concerns (proposed §
170.401) as well as the  
potential safety concerns presented by dropped messages associated with
certified functionality  
of the 2015 Edition “transitions of care” certification criterion (§
170.315(b)(1)) and standards

exercising its authority to review certified health IT that may be
causing or contributing to  
conditions that present a serious risk to public health or safety under
§ 170.580(a)(2)(i). In  
contrast, the ONC-ACB would not be responsible for reviewing the
information blocking or  
safety concerns directly, but it *would* be responsible for assessing
whether surveillance needs to  
be performed on the certified health IT for the functionality in the
2015 Edition “transitions of  
care” certification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)) and the 2015 Edition
“Direct Project” certification  
criterion (§ 170.315(h)(1)), as these requirements are found within
subpart C of Part 170 and  
could be implicated based on the complaint.  
To provide another example, an ONC-ACB could receive complaints from
users that a  
developer’s certified health IT does not support the FHIR DSTU 2
standard and associated API  
resource collection in health (ARCH Version 1) as required in the
proposed new 2015 Edition  
certification criterion § 170.315(g)(10) (proposed under subparts B and
C).The respective ONC-  
ACB(s) responsible for the certification of the certified health IT
could surveil this health IT  
under the requirements of § 170.556 (under subpart E). Additionally, ONC
could follow the CAP  
process under § 170.580(c) to enforce the associated “API” Condition of
Certification proposed  
in § 170.404(a)(2). During the course of the ONC-ACB surveillance, the
ONC-ACB  
subsequently discovers the developer has implemented the FHIR DSTU 2
standard and  
associated resources in such as a way that the patient’s historical
medications are being accessed,  
but not the patient’s current medications. The ONC-ACB would notify ONC
of its findings as it  
relates to a Condition of Certification under subpart D and pursue its
own corrective action  
process under the surveillance requirements of § 170.556. Once ONC
receives information  
regarding the complaints from the ONC-ACB, we could consider the
potential safety risks for

providers using the developer’s API to access new or referred patients’
medical information for  
diagnostic and treatment purposes. In this example, ONC could review
both the certified health  
IT and the developer action under § 170.580, which is proposed to be
expanded to account for  
developer actions under the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification
(*see* proposed §  
170.580(a)(2)(iii)) in addition to ONC’s direct investigation of
certified health IT for potential  
safety risks (*see* § 170.580(a)(2)(i)).  
  
6\. Concurrent Enforcement by the Office of Inspector General  
We clarify that the enforcement approach described in this proposal
would apply to  
ONC’s administration of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification
and other  
requirements under the Program but would not apply to other agencies or
offices that have  
independent authority to investigate and take enforcement action against
a health IT developer of  
certified health IT. Notably, section 3022(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the PHSA, as
added by the Cures Act,  
authorizes the OIG to investigate claims that a health IT developer of
certified health IT has  
engaged in information blocking, which is defined by section 3022(a)(1)
of the PHSA subject to  
reasonable and necessary activities identified by the Secretary as
exceptions to the definition as  
proposed at part 171 (see section VIII. of this proposed rule).
Additionally, section  
3022(b)(1)(A)(i) authorizes OIG to investigate claims that a health IT
developer of certified  
health IT has submitted a false attestation under the Condition of
Certification described at  
section 3001(c)(5)(D)(vii). We emphasize that ONC’s and OIG’s respective
authorities under the  
Cures Act (and in general) are independent and that either or both
offices may exercise those  
authorities at any time.  
****  
**NOTICE**  
**** This HHS-approved document has been submitted to the Office of the
Federal Register (OFR) for publication and  
has not yet been placed on public display or published in the Federal

process. The document published in the Federal Register is the official
HHS-approved document.  

-----

<span id="323"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **323** of **724**  
  
We anticipate, however, that ONC and OIG may coordinate their respective
enforcement  
activities, as appropriate, such as by sharing information about claims
or suggestions of possible  
information blocking or false attestations (including violations of
Conditions and Maintenance of  
Certification that may indicate that a developer has falsely attested to
meeting a condition).  
Therefore, we propose that we may coordinate our review of a claim of
information blocking  
with the OIG or defer to the OIG to lead a review of a claim of
information blocking. In addition,  
we propose that we may rely on OIG findings to form the basis of a
direct review action.  
7\. Applicability of Conditions and Maintenance of Certification
Requirements for Self-  
Developers  
The final rule establishing ONC’s Permanent Certification Program,
“Establishment of  
the Permanent Certification for Health Information” (76 FR 1261),
addresses self-developers.  
The language in the final rule describes the concept of “self-developed”
as referring to a  
Complete EHR or EHR Module designed, created, or modified by an entity
that assumed the  
total costs for testing and certification and that will be the primary
user of the health IT (76 FR  
1300). Therefore, self-developers differ from other health IT developers
in that their products are  
not made commercially available and they do not have customers. While we
propose that all  
general Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements apply
to such developers, we  
also seek comment on which *aspects* of the Conditions and Maintenance
of Certification  
requirements may not be applicable to self-developers. For example, when
considering the  
Communications Condition of Certification, a self-developer of health IT
may not have customer  
contracts, but could have other agreements in place, such as NDAs, that
would be subject to the  
Condition of Certification.

**VIII. Information Blocking**  
*A. Statutory Basis*  
  
Section 4004 of the Cures Act added section 3022 of the PHSA (42 U.S.C.
300jj–52, **** “the  
information blocking provision”). Section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA defines
practices that  
constitute information blocking when engaged in by a health care
provider, or a health  
information technology developer, exchange, or network. Section
3022(a)(3) authorizes the  
Secretary to identify, through notice and comment rulemaking, reasonable
and necessary  
activities that do not constitute information blocking for purposes of
the definition set forth in  
section 3022(a)(1). We propose to establish seven exceptions to the
information blocking  
definition, each of which would define certain activities that would not
constitute information  
blocking for purposes of section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA because they are
reasonable and  
necessary to further the ultimate policy goals of the information
blocking provision. We also  
propose to interpret or define certain statutory terms and concepts that
are ambiguous,  
incomplete, or provide the Secretary with discretion, and that we
believe are necessary to carry  
out the Secretary’s rulemaking responsibilities under section
3022(a)(3).  
*B. Legislative Background and Policy Considerations*  
  
In this section, we outline the purpose of the information blocking
provision and related  
policy and practical considerations that we considered in identifying
the reasonable and  
necessary activities that are proposed as exceptions to the definition
of information blocking  
described subsequently in section VIII.D of this preamble.

The information blocking provision was enacted in response to concerns
that some  
individuals and entities are engaging in practices that unreasonably
limit the availability and use  
of electronic health information (EHI) for authorized and permitted
purposes. These practices  
undermine public and private sector investments in the nation’s health
IT infrastructure and  
frustrate efforts to use modern technologies to improve health care
quality and efficiency,  
accelerate research and innovation, and provide greater value and choice
to health care  
consumers.  
  
The nature and extent of information blocking has come into sharp focus
in recent years.  
In 2015, at the request of Congress, we submitted a Report on Health
Information Blocking[101](ONCs.html#325)  
(“Information Blocking Congressional Report”), in which we commented on
the then current  
state of technology and of health IT and health care markets. Notably,
we observed that  
prevailing market conditions create incentives for some individuals and
entities to exercise their  
control over EHI in ways that limit its availability and use.  
Since that time, we have continued to receive complaints and reports of
information  
blocking from patients, clinicians, health care executives, payers, app
developers and other  
technology companies, registries and health information exchanges,
professional and trade  
associations, and many other stakeholders. ONC has listened to and
reviewed these complaints  
and reports, consulted with stakeholders, and solicited input from our
federal partners in order to  
inform our proposed information blocking policies. Stakeholders
described discriminatory  
pricing policies that have the obvious purpose and effect of excluding
competitors from the use

of interoperability elements. Many of the industry stakeholders who
shared their perspectives  
with us in listening sessions, including several health IT developers of
certified health IT,  
condemned these practices and urged us to swiftly address them. Our
engagement with  
stakeholders confirms that, despite significant public and private
sector efforts to improve  
interoperability and data accessibility, adverse incentives remain and
continue to undermine  
progress toward a more connected health system.  
Based on these economic realities and our first-hand experience working
with the health  
IT industry and stakeholders, in the Information Blocking Congressional
Report, we concluded  
that information blocking is a serious problem and recommended that
Congress prohibit  
information blocking and provide penalties and enforcement mechanisms to
deter these harmful  
practices.  
  
Recent empirical and economic research further underscores the
intractability of this  
problem and its harmful effects. In a national survey of health
information organizations, half of  
respondents reported that EHR developers routinely engage in information
blocking, and a  
quarter of respondents reported that hospitals and health systems
routinely do so. The survey  
reported that perceived motivations for such conduct included, for EHR
vendors, maximizing  
short-term revenue and competing for new clients, and for hospitals and
health systems,  
strengthening their competitive position relative to other hospitals and
health systems.[102](ONCs.html#326)Other  
research suggests that these practices weaken competition among health
care providers by  
limiting patient mobility, encouraging consolidation, and creating
barriers to entry for developers

of new and innovative applications and technologies that enable more
effective uses of clinical  
data to improve population health and the patient
experience.[103](ONCs.html#327)  
The information blocking provision provides a comprehensive response to
these  
concerns. The information blocking provision defines and creates
possible penalties and  
disincentives for information blocking in broad terms, while working to
deter the entire spectrum  
of practices that unnecessarily impede the flow of EHI or its use to
improve health and the  
delivery of care. The information blocking provision applies to the
conduct of health care  
providers, and to health IT developers of certified health IT,
exchanges, and networks, and seeks  
to deter it with substantial penalties, including civil money penalties,
and disincentives for  
violations. Additionally, developers of health IT certified under the
Program are prohibited from  
information blocking under 3001(c)(5)(D)(i) of the PHSA. To promote
effective enforcement,  
the information blocking provision empowers the HHS Office of Inspector
General (OIG) to  
investigate claims of information blocking and provides referral
processes to facilitate  
coordination with other relevant agencies, including ONC, the HHS Office
for Civil Rights  
(OCR), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The information blocking
provision also  
provides for a complaint process and corresponding confidentiality
protections to encourage and  
facilitate the reporting of information blocking. Enforcement of the
information blocking  
provision is buttressed by section 3001(c)(5)(D)(i) and (vi) of the
PHSA, which prohibits

information blocking by developers of certified health IT as a Condition
and Maintenance of  
Certification requirement under the Program and requires them to attest
that they have not  
engaged in such practices.  
  
2\. Policy Considerations and Approach to the Information Blocking
Provision  
  
To ensure that individuals and entities that engage in information
blocking are held  
accountable, the information blocking provision encompasses a relatively
broad range of  
potential practices. For example, it is possible that some activities
that are innocuous, or even  
beneficial, could technically implicate the information blocking
provision. Given the possibility  
of these practices, Congress authorized the Secretary to identify
reasonable and necessary  
activities that do not constitute information blocking (see section
3022(a)(3) of the PHSA) (in  
this proposed rule, we refer to such reasonable and necessary activities
identified by the  
Secretary as “exceptions” to the information blocking provision). The
information blocking  
provision also excludes from the definition of information blocking
practices that are required by  
law (section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA) and clarifies certain other
practices that would not be  
penalized (sections 3022(a)(6) and (7) of the PHSA).  
In considering potential exceptions to the information blocking
provision, we must  
balance a number of policy and practical considerations. To minimize
compliance and other  
burdens for stakeholders, we seek to promote policies that are clear,
predictable, and  
administrable. In addition, we seek to implement the information
blocking provision in a way  
that is sensitive to legitimate practical challenges that may prevent
access, exchange, or use of  
EHI in certain situations. We must also accommodate practices that,
while they may inhibit  
access, exchange, or use of EHI, are reasonable and necessary to advance
other compelling

policy interests, such as preventing harm to patients and others,
promoting the privacy and  
security of EHI, and promoting competition and consumer welfare.  
  
At the same time, while pursuing these objectives, we must adhere to
Congress’s plainly  
expressed intent to provide a comprehensive response to the information
blocking problem.  
Information blocking can occur through a variety of business, technical,
and organizational  
practices that can be difficult to detect and that are constantly
changing as technology and  
industry conditions evolve. The statute responds to these challenges by
defining information  
blocking broadly and in a manner that allows for careful consideration
of relevant facts and  
circumstances in individual cases.  
  
Accordingly, we propose to establish certain defined exceptions to the
information  
blocking provision. These exceptions would be subject to strict
conditions that balance the  
considerations described above. Based on those considerations, in
developing the proposed  
exceptions, we applied three overarching policy criteria. First, each
exception would be limited  
to certain activities that are both reasonable and necessary to advance
the aims of the information  
blocking provision. These reasonable and necessary activities include:
promoting public  
confidence in the health IT infrastructure by supporting the privacy and
security of EHI, and  
protecting patient safety; and promoting competition and innovation in
health IT and its use to  
provide health care services to consumers. Second, we believe that each
exception addresses a  
significant risk that regulated individuals and entities will not engage
in these reasonable and  
necessary activities because of uncertainty regarding the breadth or
applicability of the  
information blocking provision. Third, and last, each exception is
intended to be tailored,  
through appropriate conditions, so that it is limited to the reasonable
and necessary activities that

it is designed to protect and does not extend protection to other
activities or practices that could  
raise information blocking concerns.  
We discuss these policy considerations in more detail in the context of
each of the  
exceptions proposed in section VIII.D of this preamble.  
*C. Relevant Statutory Terms and Provisions*  
  
In this section of the preamble, we discuss how we propose to interpret
certain aspects of  
the information blocking provision that we believe are ambiguous,
incomplete, or that provide  
the Secretary with discretion. We propose to define or interpret certain
terms or concepts that are  
present in the statute and, in a few instances, to establish new
regulatory terms or definitions that  
we believe are necessary to implement the Secretary’s authority under
section 3022(a)(3) to  
identify reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute
information blocking. Our goal  
in interpreting the statute and defining relevant terms is to provide
greater clarity concerning the  
types of practices that could implicate the information blocking
provision and, relatedly, to more  
effectively communicate the applicability and scope of the proposed
exceptions outlined in this  
proposed rule. We believe that these proposals will provide a more
meaningful opportunity for  
the public to comment on the proposed exceptions and our overall
approach to interpreting and  
administering the information blocking provision. Additionally, we
believe additional  
interpretive clarity will assist regulated actors to comply with the
requirements of the  
information blocking provision.  
1\. “Required by Law”  
With regard to the statute’s exclusion of practices that are “required
by law” from the  
definition of information blocking, we emphasize that “required by law”
refers specifically to

interferences with access, exchange, or use of EHI that are explicitly
required by state or federal  
law. By carving out practices that are “required by law,” the statute
acknowledged that there are  
state and federal laws that advance important policy interests and
objectives by restricting access,  
exchange, and use of their EHI, and that practices that follow such laws
should not be considered  
information blocking.  
We note that for the purpose of developing an exception for reasonable
and necessary  
privacy-protective practices, we have distinguished between
interferences that are “required by  
law” and those engaged in pursuant to a privacy law, but which are not
“required by law.” The  
former does not fall within the definition of information blocking, but
the latter may implicate  
the information blocking provision and an exception may be necessary.
For a detailed discussion  
of this topic, please see section VIII.D.2 of this preamble.  
2\. Health Care Providers, Health IT Developers, Exchanges, and
Networks  
  
Section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA, in defining information blocking, refers
to four classes  
of individuals and entities that may engage in information blocking and
which include: health  
care providers, health IT developers of certified health IT, networks,
and exchanges. We propose  
to adopt definitions of these terms to provide clarity regarding the
types of individuals and  
entities to whom the information blocking provision applies. We note
that, for convenience and  
to avoid repetition in this preamble, we typically refer to these
individuals and entities covered  
by the information blocking provision as “actors” unless it is relevant
or useful to refer to the  
specific type of individual or entity. That is, when the term “actor”
appears in this preamble, it  
means an individual or entity that is a health care provider, health IT
developer, exchange, or  
network. For the same reasons, we propose to define “actor” in §
171.102.

a. Health Care Providers  
  
The term “health care provider” is defined in section 3000(3) of the
PHSA. We propose  
to adopt this definition for purposes of section 3022 of the PHSA when
defining “health care  
provider” in § 171.102. We note that this definition is different from
the definition of “health  
care provider” under the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. We are
considering adjusting the  
information blocking definition of “health care provider” to cover all
individuals and entities  
covered by the HIPAA “health care provider” definition. We seek comment
on whether this  
approach would be justified, and commenters are encouraged to specify
reasons why doing so  
might be necessary to ensure that the information blocking provision
applies to all health care  
providers that might engage in information blocking.  
b. Health IT Developers of Certified Health IT  
Section 3022(a)(1)(B) of the PHSA defines information blocking, in part,
by reference to  
the conduct of “health information technology developers.” Because title
XXX of the PHSA  
does not define “health information technology developer,” we interpret
section 3022(a)(1)(B) in  
light of the specific authority provided to OIG in section 3022(b)(1)(A)
and (b)(2). Section  
3022(b)(2) discusses developers, networks, and exchanges in terms of an
“individual or entity,”  
specifically cross-referencing section 3022(b)(1)(A). Sections
3002(b)(1) and (b)(1)(A) state, in  
relevant part, that the OIG may investigate information blocking claims
regarding a health  
information technology developer of certified health information
technology or other entity  
offering certified health information technology. Together, these
sections make clear that the  
information blocking provisions and OIG’s authority extend to
individuals *or* entities that  
develop *or* offer certified health IT. That the individual or entity
must develop or offer *certified*

health IT is further supported by section 3022(a)(7) of the PHSA—which
refers to developers’  
responsibilities to meet the requirements of certification—and section
4002 of the Cures Act—  
which identifies information blocking as a Condition of Certification.  
Notwithstanding this, the Cures Act does not prescribe that conduct that
may implicate  
the information blocking provisions be limited to practices related to
*only* certified health IT.  
Rather, the information blocking provisions would be implicated by any
practice engaged in by  
an individual or entity that develops or offers certified health IT that
is likely to interfere with the  
access, exchange, or use of EHI, including practices associated with
*any* of the developer or  
offeror’s health IT products that have *not* been certified under the
Program. This interpretation is  
based primarily on section 3022(b)(1) of the PHSA. If Congress had
intended that the  
enforcement of the information blocking provisions were limited to
practices connected to  
certified health IT, we believe the Cures Act would have included
language that tied enforcement  
to the operation or performance of a product certified under the
Program. Rather, the description  
of the practices that OIG can investigate in section 3022(b)(1)(A)(ii)
of the PHSA are not tied to  
the certification status of the health IT at issue, omitting any express
reference to a health IT  
developer’s practice needing to be related to “certified health
information technology.” That the  
scope of the information blocking provision should not be limited to
practices that involve only  
certified health IT is further evidenced by no such limitation applying
to health care providers,  
health information exchanges (HIEs), and health information networks
(HINs) as listed in  
sections 3022(b)(1) of the PHSA.  
Additionally, the “practice described” in section 3022(a)(2) of the PHSA
refers to  
“certified health information technologies” when illustrating practices
that restrict authorized

access, exchange, or use of EHI under applicable state or federal laws
(section 3022(a)(2)(A) of  
the PHSA), but omits any reference to certification when describing
“health information  
technology” in the practices described in sections 3022(a)(2)(B) and (C)
of the PHSA.  
Importantly, sections 3022(a)(2)(B) and (C) of the PHSA address
practices that are particularly  
relevant to health IT developers and offerors, although they could be
engaged in by other types  
of actors. We interpret this drafting as a deliberate decision not to
link the information blocking  
provisions with only the performance or use of certified health IT.  
Finally, we note that the Cures Act does not impose a temporal nexus
that would require  
that information blocking be carried out at a time when an individual or
entity had health IT  
certified under the Program. Ostensibly, then, once an individual or
entity has health IT certified,  
or otherwise maintains the certification of health IT, the individual or
entity becomes forever  
subject to the information blocking provision. We do not believe that,
understood in context, the  
Cures Act supports such a broad interpretation. Noting the above
discussion concerning OIG’s  
scope of authority under section 3022(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2) of the PHSA,
we believe that to make  
developers and offerors of certified health IT subject to the
information blocking provision in  
perpetuity would be inconsistent with the voluntary nature of the
Program. However, we also  
believe that the Cures Act does not provide any basis for interpreting
the information blocking  
provision so narrowly that a developer or offeror of certified health IT
could escape penalty as a  
consequence of having its certification terminated or by withdrawing all
of its extant  
certifications.  
We consider that in the circumstances where a health IT developer has
its certification  
terminated, or withdraws its certification, such that it no longer has
any health IT certified under

the Program, it should nonetheless be subject to penalties for
information blocking engaged in  
during the time that it did have health IT certified under the Program.
Accordingly, we propose  
to adopt a definition of “heath information technology (IT) developer of
certified health IT” for  
the purposes of interpretation and enforcement of the information
blocking provisions, including  
those regulatory provisions proposed under Title 45, part 171, of the
Code of Federal  
Regulations, that would capture such developers or offerors. We propose,
in § 171.102, that  
“health IT developer of certified health IT” means an individual or
entity that develops or offers  
health information technology (as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C.
300jj(5)) and which had, at  
the time it engaged in a practice that is the subject of an information
blocking claim, health IT  
(one or more) certified under the Program. To note, we propose that the
term “information  
blocking claim” within this definition should be read broadly to
encompass any statement of  
information blocking or potential information blocking. “Claims” of
information blocking within  
this definition would not be limited, in any way, to a specific form,
format, or submission  
approach or process.  
We are also considering additional approaches to help ensure that
developers and offerors  
of certified health IT remain subject to the information blocking
provision for an appropriate  
period of time after leaving the Program. The rationale for this
approach would be that a  
developer or offeror of certified health IT should be subject to
penalties if, following the  
termination or withdrawal of certification, it refused to provide its
customers with access to the  
EHI stored in the decertified health IT, provided that such interference
was not required by law  
and did not qualify for one of the information blocking exceptions.
Adopting this broader  
approach would help avoid the risk that a developer would be able to
engage in the practices

described in section 3022(a)(2) of the PHSA in respect to EHI that was
collected on behalf of a  
health care provider when that health care provider would reasonably
expect that the information  
blocking provision would protect against unreasonable and unnecessary
interferences with that  
EHI. If the information blocking provision did not extend to capture
such conduct, the protection  
afforded by the information blocking provision could become illusory,
and providers would need  
to consider securing contractual rights to prevent interference, which
we are aware they typically  
have great difficulty doing.[104](ONCs.html#336)  
One way that this could be achieved would be to define “health IT
developer of certified  
health IT” as including developers and offerors of certified health IT
that continue to store EHI  
that was previously stored in health IT certified in the Program.
Alternatively, we are considering  
whether developers and offerors of certified health IT should remain
subject to the information  
blocking provision for an appropriate period of time after leaving the
Program. Namely, that the  
information blocking provision should apply for a specific time period,
say one year, after the  
developer or offeror no longer has any health IT certified in the
Program. This second approach  
has the attraction of providing a more certain basis for understanding
which developers are  
subject to the information blocking provision. However, it also
potentially captures developers  
and offerors who have fully removed themselves from the Program and, for
example, no longer  
exercise control over EHI that was stored in their certified health
IT.  
We seek comment on which of these two models best achieves our policy
goal of  
ensuring that health IT developers of certified health IT will face
consequences under the

information blocking provision if they engage in information blocking in
connection with EHI  
that was stored or controlled by the developer or offeror whilst they
were participating in the  
program. Commenters are also encouraged to identify alternative models
and approaches for  
identifying when a developer or offeror should, and should no longer, be
subject to the  
information blocking provision.  
We note that a developer or offeror of a single health IT product that
has had its  
certification suspended would be considered to *have* certified health
IT for the purpose of the  
definition. We also note that we interpret the requirement that the
health IT developer of certified  
health IT “exercise control” over EHI broadly. A developer would not
necessarily need to have  
access to the EHI in order to exercise control. For example, a developer
that implemented a “kill-  
switch” for a decertified software product that was locally hosted by a
health care provider,  
preventing that provider from accessing its records, would be exercising
control over the EHI for  
the purpose of this definition.  
We clarify that we interpret “individual or entity that develops the
certified health IT” as  
the individual or entity that is legally responsible for the
certification status of the health IT,  
which would be the individual or entity that entered into a binding
agreement that resulted in the  
certification status of the health IT under the Program or, if such
rights are transferred, the  
individual or entity that holds the rights to the certified health IT.
We also clarify that an  
“individual or entity that offers certified health IT” would include an
individual or entity that  
under any arrangement makes certified health IT available for purchase
or license. We seek  
comment on both of our interpretations. More specifically, we seek
comment on whether there  
are particular types of arrangements under which certified health IT is
“offered” in which the

offeror should not be considered a “health IT developer of certified
health IT” for the purposes of  
the information blocking provisions.  
We also clarify that the proposed definition of “health IT developer of
certified health IT”  
and our interpretation of the use of “health information technology
developer” applies to Part  
171 only and does not apply to the implementation of any other section
of the PHSA or the Cures  
Act, including section 4005(c)(1) of the Cures Act.  
We clarify that API Technology Suppliers, as described in section VII.4
of this preamble  
and defined in § 170.102, would be considered health IT developers of
certified health IT subject  
to the conditions described above.  
Last, we clarify that a “self-developer” of certified health IT, as the
term has been used in  
the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program) and described in this
rulemaking (section  
VII.D.7) and previous rulemaking[105,](ONCs.html#338)would be treated as
a health care provider for the purposes  
of information blocking. This is because of our description of a
self-developer for Program  
purposes[106](ONCs.html#338) would essentially mean that such developers
would not be supplying or offering their  
certified health IT to other entities. To be clear, self-developers
would still be subject to the  
proposed Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements
because they have health IT  
certified under the Program (*see also* section VII.D.7). We welcome
comments on our  
determination regarding “self-developers” for information blocking
purposes and whether there  
  
105 The final rule establishing ONC’s Permanent Certification Program,
“Establishment of the Permanent  
Certification for Health Information” (76 FR 1261), addresses
self-developers.

“self-developed” as referring to a complete EHR or EHR  
Module designed, created, or modified by an entity that assumed the
total costs for testing and certification and that  
will be the primary user of the health IT (76 FR 1300).

are other factors we should consider in how we treat “self-developers”
of certified health IT for  
the purposes of information blocking.  
We also seek comment generally on the definition proposed for “health IT
developer of  
certified health IT.”  
c. Networks and Exchanges  
  
The terms “network” and “exchange” are not defined in the information
blocking  
provision or in any other relevant statutory provisions. We propose to
define these terms so that  
these individuals and entities that are covered by the information
blocking provision understand  
that they must comply with its provisions. In accordance with the
meaning and intent of the  
information blocking provision, we believe it is necessary to define
these terms in a way that  
does not assume the application or use of certain technologies and is
flexible enough to apply to  
the full range and diversity of exchanges and networks that exist today
and may arise in the  
future. We note that in the past few years alone many new types of
exchanges and networks that  
transmit EHI have emerged, and we expect this trend to accelerate with
continued advancements  
in technology and renewed efforts to advance trusted exchange among
networks and other  
entities under the trusted exchange framework and common agreement
provided for by section  
4003(b) of the Cures Act.  
  
In considering the most appropriate way to define these terms, we
examined how they are  
used throughout the Cures Act and the HITECH Act. Additionally, we
considered dictionary and  
industry definitions of “network” and “exchange.” While these terms have
varied usage and  
meaning in different industry contexts, certain concepts are common and
have been incorporated  
into the proposed definitions below.

i. Health Information Network  
We propose a functional definition of “health information network” (HIN)
that focuses  
on the role of these actors in the health information ecosystem. We
believe the defining attribute  
of a HIN is that it enables, facilitates, or controls the movement of
information between or  
among different individuals or entities that are unaffiliated. For this
purpose, we propose that two  
parties are affiliated if one has the power to control the other, or if
both parties are under the  
common control or ownership of a common owner. We note that a
significant implication of this  
definition is that a health care provider or other entity that enables,
facilitates, or controls the  
movement of EHI within its own organization, or between or among its
affiliated entities, is not a  
HIN in connection with that movement of information for the purposes of
this proposed rule.  
More affirmatively, we propose that an actor could be considered a HIN
if it performs  
any or any combination of the following activities. First, the actor
would be a HIN if it were to  
determine, oversee, administer, control, or substantially influence
policies or agreements that  
define the business, operational, technical, or other conditions or
requirements that enable or  
facilitate the access, exchange, or use of EHI between or among two or
more unaffiliated  
individuals or entities. Second, an actor would be a HIN if it were to
provide, manage, control, or  
substantially influence any technology or service that enables or
facilitates the access, exchange,  
or use of EHI between or among two or more unaffiliated individuals or
entities.  
Typically, a HIN will influence the sharing of EHI between many
unaffiliated individuals  
or entities. However, we do not propose to establish any minimum number
of parties or “nodes”  
beyond the requirement that there be some actual or contemplated access,
exchange, or use of  
information between or among at least two unaffiliated individuals or
entities that is enabled,

facilitated, or controlled by the HIN. We believe such a limitation
would be artificial and would  
not capture the full range of entities that should be considered
networks under the information  
blocking provision. To be clear, any individual or entity that enables,
facilitates, or controls the  
access, exchange, or use of EHI between or among only itself and another
unaffiliated individual  
or entity would not be considered a HIN in connection with the movement
of that EHI (although  
that movement of EHI may still be regulated under the information
blocking provision on the  
basis that the individual or entity is a health care provider or health
IT developer of certified  
health IT). To be a HIN, the individual or entity would need to be
enabling, facilitating, or  
controlling the access, exchange, or use of EHI between or among two or
more *other* individuals  
or entities that were not affiliated with it.  
To illustrate how the proposed definition would operate, we note the
following examples.  
An entity is established within a state for the purpose of improving the
movement of EHI  
between the health care providers operating in that state. The entity
identifies standards relating  
to security and offers terms and conditions to be entered into by health
care providers wishing to  
participate in the network. The entity offering (and then overseeing and
administering) the terms  
and conditions for participation in the network would be considered a
HIN for the purpose of the  
information blocking provision. We note that there is no need for a
separate entity to be created  
in order that an entity be considered a HIN. For instance, a health
system that administers  
business and operational agreements for facilitating the exchange of EHI
that are adhered to by  
unaffiliated family practices and specialist clinicians in order to
streamline referrals between  
those practices and specialists would likely be considered a HIN.

We note that the proposed definition would also encompass an individual
or entity that  
does not directly enable, facilitate, or control the movement of
information, but nonetheless  
exercises control or substantial influence over the policies,
technology, or services of a network.  
In particular, there may be an individual or entity that relies on
another entity—such as an entity  
specifically created for the purpose of managing a network—for policies
and technology, but  
nevertheless dictates the movement of EHI over that network. For
example, a large health care  
provider may decide to lead an effort to establish a network that
facilitates the movement of EHI  
between a group of smaller health care providers (as well as the large
health care provider) and  
through the technology of health IT developers. To achieve this outcome,
the large health care  
provider, together with some of the participants, creates a new entity
that administers the  
network’s policies and technology. In this scenario, the large health
care provider would come  
within the functional definition of a HIN and could be held accountable
for the conduct of the  
network if the large health care provider used its control or
substantial influence over the new  
entity—either in a legal sense, such as via its control over the
governance or management of the  
entity, or in a less formal sense, such as if the large health care
provider prescribed a policy to be  
adopted—to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI. We note
that the large health  
care provider in this example would be treated as a health care provider
when utilizing the  
network to move EHI via the network’s policies, technology, or services,
but would be  
considered a HIN in connection with the practices of the network over
which the large health  
care provider exercises control or substantial influence.  
We seek comment on the proposed definition of a HIN. In particular, we
request  
comment on whether the proposed definition is broad enough (or too
broad) to cover the full

range of individuals and entities that could be considered health
information networks within the  
meaning of the information blocking provision. Additionally, we
specifically request comment  
on whether the proposed definition would effectuate our policy goal of
defining this term in a  
way that does not assume particular technologies or arrangements and is
flexible enough to  
accommodate changes in these and other conditions.  
  
  
  
ii. Health Information Exchange  
  
We propose to define a “health information exchange” (HIE) as an
individual or entity  
that enables access, exchange, or use of EHI primarily between or among
a particular class of  
individuals or entities or for a limited set of purposes. Our research
and experience in working  
with exchanges drove the proposed definition of this term. HIEs include
but are not limited to  
regional health information organizations (RHIOs), state health
information exchanges (state  
HIEs), and other types of organizations, entities, or arrangements that
enable EHI to be accessed,  
exchanged, or used between or among particular types of parties or for
particular purposes. For  
example, an HIE might facilitate or enable the access, exchange, or use
of EHI exclusively  
within a regional area (such as a RHIO), or for a limited scope of
participants and purposes (such  
as a clinical data registry or an exchange established by a
hospital-physician organization to  
facilitate Admission, Discharge, and Transfer (ADT) alerting). We note
that HIEs may be  
established under federal or state laws or regulations but may also be
established for specific  
health care or business purposes or use cases. Additionally, we note
that if an HIE facilitates the  
access, exchange, or use of EHI for more than a narrowly defined set of
purposes, then it may be  
both an HIE and a HIN.

We seek comment on this proposed definition of an HIE. Again, we
encourage  
commenters to consider whether this proposed definition is broad enough
(or too broad) to cover  
the full range of individuals and entities that could be considered
exchanges within the meaning  
of the information blocking provision, and whether the proposed
definition is sufficiently  
flexible to accommodate changing technological and other conditions.  
  
3\. Electronic Health Information  
  
The definition of information blocking applies to *electronic* health
information (EHI)  
(section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA). While section 3000(4) of the PHSA by
reference to section  
1171(4) of the Social Security Act defines “health information,” EHI is
not specifically defined  
in the Cures Act, HITECH Act, or other relevant statutes. We propose to
define EHI to mean:  
(i) electronic protected health information; and  
(ii) any other information that –  
• is transmitted by or maintained in electronic media, as defined in 45
CFR § 160.103;  
• identifies the individual, or with respect to which there is a
reasonable basis to believe the  
information can be used to identify the individual; and  
• relates to the past, present, or future health or condition of an
individual; the provision of  
health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment
for the provision of health  
care to an individual.  
This definition of EHI includes, but is not limited to, electronic
protected health  
information and health information that is created or received by a
health care provider and those  
operating on their behalf; health plan; health care clearinghouse;
public health authority;  
employer; life insurer; school; or university. In addition, we clarify
that under our proposed

<span id="345"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **345** of **724**  
  
definition, EHI includes, but is not limited to, electronic protected
health information (ePHI) as  
defined in 45 CFR 160.103. In particular, unlike ePHI and health
information, EHI is not limited  
to information that is created or received by a health care provider,
health plan, health care  
clearinghouse, public health authority, employer, life insurer, school,
or university. EHI may be  
provided, directly from an individual, or from technology that the
individual has elected to use,  
to an actor covered by the information blocking provisions. We propose
that EHI does not  
include health information that is de-identified consistent with the
requirements of 45 CFR  
164.514(b). We generally request comment on this proposed definition as
well as on whether the  
exclusion of health information that is de-identified is consistent with
the requirements of 45  
CFR 164.514(b).  
  
To be clear, this definition provides for an expansive set of EHI, which
could include  
information on an individual’s health insurance eligibility and
benefits, billing for health care  
services, and payment information for services to be provided or already
provided, which may  
include price information.  
  
  
*Price Information*  
The fragmented and complex nature of pricing within the health care
system has  
decreased the efficiency of the health care system and has had negative
impacts on patients,  
health care providers, health systems, plans, plan sponsors and other
key health care  
stakeholders. Patients and plan sponsors have trouble anticipating or
planning for costs, are not  
sure how they can lower their costs, are not able to compare costs, and
have no practical way to  
measure the quality of the care or coverage they receive relative to the
price they pay. Pricing  
information continues to grow in importance with the increase of high
deductible health plans

and surprise billing, which have resulted in an increase in
out-of-pocket health care spending.  
Transparency in the price and cost of health care would help address the
concerns outlined above  
by empowering patients to make informed health care decisions. Further,
the availability of price  
information could help increase competition that is based on the quality
and value of the services  
patients receive. Consistent with its statutory authority, the
Department is considering  
subsequent rulemaking to expand access to price information for the
public, prospective patients,  
plan sponsors, and health care providers.  
Increased consumer demand, aligned incentives, more accessible and
digestible  
information, and the evolution of price transparency tools are critical
components to moving to a  
health care system that pays for value. However, the complex and
decentralized nature of how  
price information is created, structured, formatted, and stored presents
many challenges to  
achieving price transparency. To this point, pricing within health care
demands a market-based  
approach whereby, for example, platforms are created that utilize raw
data to provide consumers  
with digestible price information through their preferred medium.  
ONC has a unique role in setting the stage for such future actions by
establishing the  
framework to prevent the blocking of price information. Given that price
information impacts the  
ability of patients to shop for and make decisions about their care, we
seek comment on the  
parameters and implications of including price information within the
scope of EHI for purposes  
of information blocking. In addition, the overall Department seeks
comment on the technical,  
operational, legal, cultural, environmental and other challenges to
creating price transparency  
within health care.

4\. Interests Promoted by the Information Blocking Provision  
  
  
a. Access, Exchange, and Use of EHI  
  
The information blocking provision promotes the ability to *access,
exchange, and use*  
EHI, consistent with the requirements of applicable law. We interpret
the terms “access,”  
“exchange,” and “use” broadly, consistent with their generally
understood meaning in the health  
IT industry and their function and context in the information blocking
provision.  
  
The concepts of access, exchange, and use are closely related: EHI
cannot be used unless  
it can be accessed, and this often requires that the EHI be exchanged
among different individuals  
or entities and through various technological means. Moreover, the
technological and other  
means necessary to facilitate appropriate access and exchange of EHI
vary significantly  
depending on the purpose for which the information will be used. For
example, the technologies  
and services that support a payer’s access to EHI to assess clinical
value will likely differ from  
those that support a patient’s access to EHI via a smartphone app. That
is, to deter information  
blocking in these and many other potential uses of EHI—and, by
extension, the many and  
diverse means of access and exchange that support such uses.  
****  
**NOTICE**  
**** This HHS-approved document has been submitted to the Office of the
Federal Register (OFR) for publication and  
has not yet been placed on public display or published in the Federal
Register. The document may vary slightly  
from the published document if minor editorial changes have been made
during the OFR review  
process. The document published in the Federal Register is the official
HHS-approved document.  

-----

<span id="351"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **351** of **724**  
  
  
This is consistent with the way these terms are employed in the
information blocking  
provision and in other relevant statutory provisions. For example,
section 3022(a)(2) of the  
PHSA contemplates a broad range of purposes for which EHI may be
accessed, exchanged, and  
used—from treatment, care delivery, and other permitted purposes, to
exporting complete  
information sets and transitioning between health IT systems, to
supporting innovations and  
advancements in health information access, exchange, and use.
Separately, the Cures Act and the  
HITECH Act contemplate many different purposes for and means of
accessing, exchanging, and  
using EHI, which include, but are not limited to, quality improvement,
guiding medical decisions  
at the time and place of care, reducing medical errors and health
disparities, delivering patient-  
centered care, and supporting public health and clinical research
activities.[107](ONCs.html#351)  
  
In addition to these statutory provisions, we have considered how the
terms access,  
exchange, and use have been defined or used in existing regulations and
other relevant health IT  
industry contexts. While those definitions have specialized meanings and
are not controlling  
here, they are instructive insofar as they illustrate the breadth with
which these terms have been  
understood in other contexts. For example, the HIPAA Privacy Rule
defines an individual’s right  
of access to include the right to have a copy of all or part of their
PHI transmitted directly to  
them or any person or entity he or she designates, in any form and
format (including  
electronically) that the individual requests and that the covered entity
holding the information  
can readily produce (45 CFR § 164.524). In a different context, the
HIPAA Security Rule defines  
“access” as the ability or the means necessary to read, write, modify,
or communicate  
  
107 *See* section 3001(b) of the PHSA; *see also* section 3009(a)(3) of
the PHSA (enumerating reporting criteria  
relating to access, exchange, and use of EHI for a broad and diverse
range of purposes).

<span id="352"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **352** of **724**  
  
data/information or otherwise use any system resource (45 CFR 164.304).
The HIPAA Rules  
also define the term “use,” which includes the sharing, employment,
application, utilization,  
examination, or analysis of individually identifiable health information
within an entity that  
maintains the information (45 CFR 160.103).  
As the examples and discussion above demonstrate, the concepts of
access, exchange,  
and use are used in a variety of contexts to refer to a broad spectrum
of activities. We believe  
that the types of access, exchange, and use described above would be
promoted under the  
information blocking provision, as would other types of access,
exchange, or use not specifically  
contemplated in these or other regulations. Further, we note that the
information blocking  
provision would also extend to innovations and advancements in health
information access,  
exchange, and use that may occur in the future (see section 3022(a)(2)
of the PHSA).  
Consistent with the above, and to convey the full breadth of activities
that may implicate  
the information blocking provision, we propose definitions of access,
exchange, and use in §  
171.102. We emphasize the interrelated nature of the definitions. For
example, the definition of  
“use” includes the ability to read, write, modify, manipulate, or apply
EHI to accomplish a  
desired outcome or to achieve a desired purpose, while “access” is
defined as the ability or  
means necessary to make EHI available for *use*. As such, interference
with “access” would  
include, for example, an interference that prevented a health care
provider from writing EHI to  
its health IT or from modifying EHI stored in health IT, whether by the
provider itself or by, or  
via, a third-party app. We encourage comment on these definitions. In
particular, commenters  
may wish to consider whether these definitions are broad enough to cover
all of the potential

purposes for which EHI may be needed and ways in which it could
conceivably be used, now  
and in the future.  
  
  
b. Interoperability Elements  
  
In this proposed rule, we use the term “interoperability element” to
refer to any means by  
which EHI can be accessed, exchanged, or used. We clarify that the means
of accessing,  
exchanging, and using EHI are not limited to functional elements and
technical information but  
also encompass technologies, services, policies, and other
conditions[108](ONCs.html#353)necessary to support the  
many potential uses of EHI as described above. Because of the evolving
nature of technology  
and the diversity of privacy laws and regulations, institutional
arrangements, and policies that  
govern the sharing of EHI, we will not provide an exhaustive list of
interoperability elements.  
However, we believe that it is useful to define this term, both because
of its importance for  
analyzing the likelihood of interference under the information blocking
provision, and because  
some of the proposed exceptions to the provision contain conditions
concerning the availability  
and provision of interoperability elements. Therefore, we propose to
define “interoperability  
element” in § 171.102. As noted, our intent is to capture all of the
potential means by which EHI  
may be accessed, exchanged, or used for any relevant purposes; both now
and as technology and  
other conditions evolve. We seek comment on whether the proposed
definition realizes that  
intent and, if not, any changes we should consider.

*prevent, or materially discourage* access, exchange, or use of EHI. In
this section and elsewhere  
in this preamble, we discuss various types of hypothetical practices
that *could* implicate the  
provision. We do this to illustrate the scope of the information
blocking provision and to explain  
our interpretation of various statutory concepts. However, we stress
that the types of practices  
discussed in this preamble are illustrative, not exhaustive, and that
many other types of practices  
could also implicate the provision. Nor does the fact that we have not
identified or discussed a  
particular type of practice imply that it is less serious than those
that are discussed in this  
preamble. Indeed, because information blocking may take many forms, it
is not possible—and  
we do not attempt—to anticipate or catalog the many potential types of
practices that may raise  
information blocking concerns.  
We emphasize that any analysis of information blocking necessarily
requires a careful  
consideration of the individual facts and circumstances, including
whether the practice was  
required by law, whether the actor had the requisite statutory
knowledge, and whether an  
exception applies. When we state that a practice would implicate the
provision or *could* violate  
the provision, we are expressing a conclusion that the type of practice
is one that would be likely  
to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange,
or use of EHI, and that  
further analysis of these and other statutory elements would therefore
be warranted to determine  
whether a violation has occurred. We highlight this distinction because
to *implicate* the  
information blocking provision is not necessarily to *violate* it, and
that each case will turn on its  
own unique facts. For example, a practice that seemingly meets the
statutory definition of

information blocking would not be information blocking if it was
required by law, if one or more  
elements of the definition were not met, or if was covered by one of the
proposed exceptions.  
We propose in section VIII.D of this preamble to establish seven
exceptions to the  
information blocking provision for certain reasonable and necessary
activities. If an actor can  
establish that an exception applies to each practice for which a claim
of information blocking has  
been made, including that the actor satisfied all applicable conditions
of the exception at all  
relevant times, then the practice would not constitute information
blocking.  
Based on early discussions with stakeholders during the development of
this proposed  
rule, we are aware that the generality with which the information
blocking provision describes  
practices that are likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially
discourage access, exchange, or  
use of EHI may leave some uncertainty as to the scope of the information
blocking provision and  
the types of practices that will implicate enforcement by ONC and/or
OIG. To provide additional  
clarity on this point, we elaborate our understanding of these important
statutory concepts below.  
  
  
a. Prevention, Material Discouragement, and Other Interference  
  
The information blocking provision and its enforcement subsection do not
define the  
terms “interfere with,” “prevent,” and “materially discourage,” and use
these terms collectively  
and without differentiation. Based on our interpretation of the
information blocking provision  
and the ordinary meanings of these terms in the context of EHI, we do
not believe they are  
mutually exclusive, but that prevention and material discouragement are
best understood as types  
of interference, and that use of these terms in the statute to define
information blocking illustrates  
the desire to reach all practices that an actor knows, or should know,
are likely to prevent,  
materially discourage, or otherwise interfere with the access, exchange,
or use of EHI. Consistent

<span id="356"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **356** of **724**  
  
with this understanding, in this preamble to the proposed rule, we use
the terms “interfere with”  
and “interference” as inclusive of prevention, material discouragement,
and other forms of  
interference that implicate the information blocking provision.  
  
We believe that interference could take many forms. In addition to the
prevention or  
material discouragement of access, exchange, or use, we propose that
interference could include  
practices that increase the cost, complexity, or other burden associated
with accessing,  
exchanging, or using EHI. Additionally, interference could include
practices that limit the utility,  
efficacy, or value of EHI that is accessed, exchanged, or used, such as
by diminishing the  
integrity, quality, completeness, or timeliness of the data. We refer
readers to section VIII.C.5.c  
of this preamble below for a discussion of these and other potential
practices that could interfere  
with access, exchange, or use and thereby implicate the information
blocking provision.  
Relatedly, to avoid potential ambiguity and clearly communicate the full
range of  
potential practices that could implicate the information blocking
provision, we propose to codify  
a definition of “interfere with” in § 171.102, consistent with our
interpretation set forth above.  
  
  
b. Likelihood of Interference  
  
The information blocking provision is preventative in nature. That is,
the information  
blocking provision proscribes practices that are *likely* to interfere
with (including preventing or  
materially discouraging) access, exchange, or use of EHI—whether or not
such harm actually  
materializes. By including both the likely and the actual effects of a
practice, the information  
blocking provision encourages individuals and entities to avoid engaging
in practices that  
undermine interoperability, and to proactively promote access, exchange,
and use of EHI.

<span id="357"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **357** of **724**  
  
  
We believe that a practice would satisfy the information blocking
provision’s  
“likelihood” requirement if, under the circumstances, there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk that  
the practice will interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. For
example, where an actor  
refuses to share EHI or to provide access to certain interoperability
elements, it is reasonably  
foreseeable that such actions will interfere with access, exchange, or
use of EHI. As another  
example, it is reasonably foreseeable that a health care provider may
need to access information  
recorded in a patient’s electronic record that could be relevant to the
treatment of that patient.  
For this reason, a policy or practice that limits timely access to such
information in an  
appropriate electronic format creates a reasonably foreseeable
likelihood of interfering with the  
use of the information for these treatment purposes.  
  
Whether the risk of interference is reasonably foreseeable will depend
on the particular  
facts and circumstances attending the practice or practices at issue.
Because of the number and  
diversity of potential practices, and the fact that different practices
will present varying risks of  
interfering with access, exchange, or use of EHI, we do not attempt to
anticipate all of the  
potential ways in which the information blocking provision could be
implicated. Nevertheless, to  
assist with compliance, we clarify certain circumstances in which, based
on our experience, a  
practice will almost always be likely to interfere with access,
exchange, or use of EHI. We  
caution that these situations are not exhaustive and that other
circumstances may also give rise to  
a very high likelihood of interference under the information blocking
provision. In each case,  
ONC will consider the totality of the circumstances in evaluating
whether a practice is likely to  
implicate the statute and to give rise to a violation.

<span id="358"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **358** of **724**  
  
  
Although the information blocking provision applies to all EHI, we
believe that  
information blocking concerns are especially pronounced when the conduct
at issue has the  
potential to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI that is
created or maintained  
during the practice of medicine or the delivery of health care services
to patients. We refer to  
such information in this section of the preamble collectively as
“observational health  
information.” Such information includes, but is not limited to, health
information about a patient  
that could be captured in a patient record within an EHR and other
clinical information  
management systems; as well as information maintained in administrative
and other IT systems  
when the information is clinically relevant, directly supports patient
care, or facilitates the  
delivery of health care services to consumers. We note that there is a
special need for timely,  
electronic access to this information and that, moreover, the clinical
and operational utility of this  
information is often highly dependent on multiple actors exercising
varying forms and degrees of  
control over the information itself or the technological, contractual,
or other means by which it  
can be accessed, exchanged, and used. Against these indications,
practices that adversely impact  
the access, exchange, or use of observational health information will
almost always implicate the  
information blocking provision.  
  
We note that observational health information may be technically
structured or  
unstructured (such as “free text”). Therefore, in general, clinicians’
notes would constitute  
observational health information, at least insofar as the notes contain
observations or conclusions  
about a patient or the patient’s care. In contrast, we believe certain
types of EHI are qualitatively  
distinct from observational health information, such as EHI that is
created through aggregation,  
algorithms, and other techniques that transform observational health
information into

<span id="359"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **359** of **724**  
  
fundamentally new data or insights that are not obvious from the
observational information  
alone. This could include, for example, population-level trends,
predictive analytics, risk scores,  
and EHI used for comparisons and benchmarking activities. Similarly,
internally developed  
quality measures and care protocols are generally distinct from
observational health information.  
In general, we believe that practices that pertain solely to the
creation or use of these  
transformative data and insights would not usually present the very high
likelihood of  
interference described above. However, we emphasize that, depending on
the specific facts at  
issue, practices related to electronic non-observational health
information (a type of EHI), such  
as price information, **could** still be subject to the information
blocking provision. We seek  
comment on this proposed approach and encourage commenters to identify
potential practices  
related to non-observational health information that could raise
information blocking concerns.  
Finally, we clarify that merely collecting, organizing, formatting, or
processing  
observational health information maintained in EHRs and other source
systems does not change  
the fundamental nature of that EHI or obligations under the information
blocking provisions.  
Likewise, the mere fact that EHI is stored in a proprietary format or
has been combined with  
confidential or proprietary information does not alter the actor’s
obligations under the  
information blocking provisions to facilitate access, exchange, and use
of the EHI in response to  
a request. For example, the information blocking provision would be
implicated if an actor were  
to assert proprietary rights in medical vocabularies or code sets in a
way that was likely to  
interfere with the access, exchange, or use of observational health
information stored in such  
formats. However, as noted in section VIII.D.6 of this preamble, under
the exception for  
licensing of interoperability elements on reasonable and
non-discriminatory terms, an actor could

that royalty were offered on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms
pursuant to the conditions  
outlined in the exception.  
  
  
  
ii. Purposes for Which Information May be Needed  
  
We believe the information blocking provision will almost always be
implicated when a  
practice interferes with access, exchange, or use of EHI for certain
purposes, including but not  
limited to:  
• Providing patients with access to their EHI and the ability to
exchange and use it without  
special effort (*see* section VII.B.4).  
• Ensuring that health care professionals, care givers, and other
authorized persons have the  
EHI they need, when and where they need it, to make treatment decisions
and effectively  
coordinate and manage patient care and can use the EHI they may receive
from other  
sources.  
• Ensuring that payers and other entities that purchase health care
services can obtain the  
information they need to effectively assess clinical value and promote
transparency  
concerning the quality and costs of health care services.  
• Ensuring that health care providers can access, exchange, and use EHI
for quality  
improvement and population health management activities.  
• Supporting access, exchange, and use of EHI for patient safety and
public health purposes.  
  
The need to ensure that EHI is readily available and usable for these
purposes is  
paramount. Therefore, practices that increase the cost, difficulty, or
other burden of accessing,  
exchanging, or using EHI for these purposes would almost always
implicate the information

blocking provision. Individuals and entities that develop health IT or
have a role in making these  
technologies and services available should consider the impact of their
actions and take steps to  
support interoperability and avoid impeding the availability or use of
EHI.  
iii. Control Over Essential Interoperability Elements; Other
Circumstances  
of Reliance or Dependence  
  
An actor may have substantial control over one or more interoperability
elements that  
provide the only reasonable means of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI
for a particular  
purpose. In these circumstances, any practice by the actor that could
impede the use of the  
interoperability elements—or that could unnecessarily increase the cost
or other burden of using  
the elements—would almost always implicate the information blocking
provision.  
The situation described above is most likely when customers or users are
dependent on an  
actor’s technology or services, which can occur for any number of
reasons. For example,  
technological dependence may arise from legal or commercial relations,
such as a health care  
provider’s reliance on its EHR developer to ensure that EHI managed on
its behalf is accessible  
and usable when it is needed. Relatedly, most EHI is currently stored in
EHRs and other source  
systems that use proprietary data models or formats. Knowledge of the
data models, formats, or  
other relevant technical information (e.g., proprietary APIs) is
necessary to understand the data  
and make efficient use of it in other applications and technologies.
Because this information is  
routinely treated as confidential or proprietary, the developer’s
cooperation is required to enable  
uses of the EHI that go beyond the capabilities provided by the
developer’s technology. This  
includes the capability to export complete information sets and to
migrate data in the event that a  
user decides to switch to a different technology.

Separate from these contractual and intellectual property issues, users
may become  
“locked in” to a particular technology, HIE, or HIN for financial or
business reasons. For  
example, many health care providers have invested significant resources
to adopt EHR  
technologies—including costs for deployment, customization, data
migration, and training—and  
have tightly integrated these technologies into their information
management strategies, clinical  
workflows, and business operations. As a result, they may be reluctant
to switch to other  
technologies due to the significant cost and disruption this would
entail.  
  
Another important driver of technological dependence is the “network
effects” of health  
IT adoption, which are amplified by a reliance on technologies and
approaches that are not  
standardized and do not enable seamless interoperability. Consequently,
health care providers  
and other health IT users may gravitate towards and become reliant on
the proprietary  
technologies, HIEs, or HINs that have been adopted by other individuals
and entities with whom  
they have the greatest need to exchange EHI. These effects may be
especially pronounced within  
particular product or geographic areas. For example, a HIN that
facilitates certain types of  
exchange or transactions may be so widely adopted that it is a de facto
industry standard. A  
similar phenomenon may occur within a particular geographic area once a
critical mass of  
hospitals, physicians, or other providers adopt a particular EHR
technology, HIE, or HIN.  
In these and other analogous circumstances of reliance or dependence,
there is a  
heightened risk that an actor’s conduct will interfere with access,
exchange, or use of EHI. To

assist with compliance, we highlight the following common scenarios,
based on our outreach to  
stakeholders, in which actors exercise control over key interoperability
elements.[109](ONCs.html#363)  
• Health IT developers of certified health IT that provide EHR systems
or other technologies  
used to capture EHI at the point of care are in a unique position to
control subsequent access  
to and use of that information.  
• HINs and HIEs may be in a unique position to control the flow of
information among  
particular persons or for particular purposes, especially if the HIN or
HIE has achieved  
significant adoption in a particular geographic area or for a particular
type of health  
information use case.  
• Similar control over EHI may be exercised by other entities, such as
health IT developers of  
certified health IT, that supply or control proprietary technologies,
platforms, or services that  
are widely adopted by a class of users or that are a “de facto standard”
for certain types of  
EHI exchanges or transactions.  
• Health care providers within health systems and other entities that
provide health IT  
platforms, infrastructure, or information sharing policies may have a
degree of control over  
interoperability or the movement of data within a geographic area that
is functionally  
equivalent to the control exercised by a dominant health IT developer,
HIN, or HIE.  
To avoid violating the information blocking provision, actors with
control over  
interoperability elements should be careful not to engage in practices
that exclude persons from  
the use of those elements or create artificial costs or other
impediments to their use.  
  
109 As an important clarification, we note that control over
interoperability elements may exist with or without the  
actor’s ability to manipulate the price of the interoperability elements
in the market.

We encourage comment on these and other circumstances that may present
an especially  
high likelihood that a practice will interfere with access, exchange, or
use of EHI within the  
meaning of the information blocking provision.  
c. Examples of Practices Likely to Interfere with Access, Exchange, or
Use of  
EHI  
  
To further clarify the scope of the information blocking provision,
below we describe  
several types of practices that would be likely to interfere with
access, exchange, or use of EHI.  
These examples clarify and expand on those set forth in section
3022(a)(2) of the PHSA.  
Because information blocking can take many forms, we emphasize that the
categories of  
practices described below are illustrative only and do not provide an
exhaustive list or  
comprehensive description of practices that may implicate the
information blocking provision  
and its penalties. We also reiterate that to implicate the provision is
not necessarily to violate it,  
and that each case will turn on its own unique facts. For instance, a
practice that seemingly meets  
the statutory definition of information blocking would not be
information blocking if it was  
required by law, if one or more elements of the definition were not met,
or if it was covered by  
one of the proposed exceptions for certain reasonable and necessary
activities detailed in section  
VIII.D of this preamble. For the purposes of the following discussion,
we do not consider the  
applicability of any exceptions proposed in section VIII.D of this
preamble; we therefore  
strongly encourage readers to review that section in conjunction with
the discussion of practices  
in this section below.  
  
  
  
i. Restrictions on Access, Exchange, or Use

The information blocking provision establishes penalties, including
civil monetary  
penalties, or requires appropriate disincentives, for practices that
restrict access, exchange, or use  
of EHI for permissible purposes. For example, section 3022(a)(2)(A) of
the PHSA states that  
information blocking may include practices that restrict authorized
access, exchange, or use for  
treatment and other permitted purposes under applicable law. Section
3022(a)(2)(C)(i) of the  
PHSA states that information blocking may include implementing health IT
in ways that are  
likely to restrict the access, exchange, or use of EHI with respect to
exporting complete  
information sets or in transitioning between health IT systems.  
  
One means by which actors may restrict access, exchange, or use of EHI
is through  
formal restrictions. These may be expressed in contract or license
terms, EHI sharing policies,  
organizational policies or procedures, or other instruments or documents
that set forth  
requirements related to EHI or health IT. Additionally, in the absence
of an express contractual  
restriction, an actor may achieve the same result by exercising
intellectual property or other  
rights in ways that restrict access, exchange, or use. As an
illustration, the following non-  
exhaustive examples illustrate types of formal restrictions that would
likely implicate the  
information blocking provision. As stated above, the examples throughout
this section  
VIII.C.5.c. are presented without consideration to whether a proposed
exception applies, and  
readers are encouraged to familiarize themselves with section VIII.D of
this preamble.  
• A health system’s internal policies or procedures require staff to
obtain an individual’s  
written consent before sharing any of a patient’s EHI with unaffiliated
providers for  
treatment purposes even though obtaining an individual’s consent is not
required by state or  
federal law.

• An EHR developer’s software license agreement prohibits a customer
from disclosing to its  
IT contractors certain technical interoperability information without
which the customer and  
its IT contractors cannot efficiently export and convert EHI for use in
other applications.  
• A HIN’s participation agreement prohibits entities that receive EHI
through the HIN from  
transmitting that EHI to entities who are not participants of the HIN.  
• An EHR developer sues to prevent a clinical data registry from
providing interfaces to  
physicians who use the developer’s EHR technology and wish to submit EHI
to the registry.  
The EHR developer claims that the registry is infringing the developer’s
copyright in its  
database because the interface incorporates data mapping that references
the table headings  
and rows of the EHR database in which the EHI is stored.  
  
Access, exchange, or use of EHI can also be restricted in less formal
ways. The  
information blocking provision would be implicated, for example, where
an actor simply refuses  
to exchange or to facilitate the access or use of EHI, either as a
general practice or in isolated  
instances. The refusal may be expressly stated, or it may be implied
from the actor’s conduct, as  
where the actor ignores requests to share EHI or provide
interoperability elements; gives  
implausible reasons for not doing so; or insists on terms or conditions
that are so objectively  
unreasonable that they amount to a refusal to provide access, exchange,
or use of the EHI. Some  
examples of informal restrictions include, but are not limited to:  
• A health IT developer of certified health IT refuses to license
interoperability elements that  
are reasonably necessary for the developer’s customers, their IT
contractors, and other health  
IT developers to develop and deploy software that will work with the
certified health IT.

the right to use it for  
its own purposes—terms that almost no developer would willingly
accept.  
• A provider notifies its EHR developer of its intent to switch to
another EHR system and  
requests a complete export of its EHI. The developer will provide only
the EHI in a PDF  
format, even though it already can and does produce the data in a
commercially reasonable  
structured format.  
We emphasize that restrictions on access, exchange, or use that are
required by law  
would not implicate the information blocking provision. Moreover, we
recognize that some  
restrictions, while not required by law, may be reasonable and necessary
for the privacy and  
security of individuals’ EHI; such practices may qualify for protection
under the exceptions  
proposed in section VIII.D.2 and 3 of this preamble.  
  
  
  
ii. Limiting or Restricting the Interoperability of Health IT  
The information blocking provision includes practices that restrict the
access, exchange,  
or use of EHI in various ways (*see* section 3022(a)(2) of the PHSA).
These practices could  
include, for example, disabling or restricting the use of a capability
that enables users to share  
EHI with users of other systems or to provide access to EHI to certain
types of persons or for  
certain purposes that are legally permissible. In addition, the
information blocking provision  
would be implicated where an actor configures or otherwise implements
technology in ways that

limit the types of data elements that can be exported or used from the
technology. Other practices  
that would be suspect include configuring capabilities in a way that
removes important context,  
structure, or meaning from the EHI, or that makes the data less
accurate, complete, or usable for  
important purposes for which it may be needed. Likewise, implementing
capabilities in ways that  
create unnecessary delays or response times, or that otherwise limit the
timeliness of EHI  
accessed or exchanged, would interfere with the access, exchange, and
use of that information  
and would therefore implicate the information blocking provision. We
note that any conclusions  
regarding such interference would be based on fact-finding specific to
each case and would need  
to consider the applicability of an exception.  
  
We propose that the information blocking provision would be implicated
if an actor were  
to deploy technological measures that limit or restrict the ability to
reverse engineer the  
functional aspects of technology in order to develop means for
extracting and using EHI  
maintained in the technology. This may include, for example, employing
technological  
protection measures that, if circumvented, would trigger liability under
the Digital Millennium  
Copyright Act (*see* 17 U.S.C. 1201) or other laws.  
The following hypothetical situations illustrate some (though not all)
of the types of  
practices described above and which would implicate the information
blocking provision.  
• A health system implements locally-hosted EHR technology certified to
proposed §  
170.315(g)(10) (the health system acts as an API Data Provider as
defined by § 170.102). As  
required by proposed § 170.404(b)(2), the technology developer provides
the health system  
with the capability to automatically publish its production endpoints
(i.e., the internet servers  
that an app must “call” and interact with in order to request and
exchange patient data). The

-----

<span id="369"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **369** of **724**  
  
health system chooses not to enable this capability, however, and
provides the production  
endpoint information only to apps it specifically approves. This
prevents other applications—  
and patients that use them—from accessing data that should be made
readily accessible via  
standardized APIs.  
• A hospital directs its EHR developer to configure its technology so
that users cannot easily  
send electronic patient referrals and associated EHI to unaffiliated
providers, even when the  
user knows the Direct address and/or identity (i.e., National Provider
Identifier) of the  
unaffiliated provider.  
• An EHR developer that prevents (such as by way of imposing exorbitant
fees unrelated to the  
developer’s costs, or by some technological means) a third-party
clinical decision support  
(CDS) app from writing EHI to the records maintained by the EHR
developer on behalf of a  
health care provider (despite the provider authorizing the third-party
app developer’s use of  
EHI) because the EHR developer: (1) offers a competing CDS software to
the third-party  
app; and (2) includes functionality (e.g., APIs) in its health IT that
would provide the third  
party with the technical capability to modify those records as desired
by the health care  
provider.  
• Although an EHR developer’s patient portal offers the capability for
patients to directly  
transmit or request for direct transmission of their EHI to a third
party, the developer’s  
customers (e.g., health care providers) choose not to enable this
capability.  
• A health care provider has the capability to provide same-day access
to EHI in a form and  
format requested by a patient or a patient’s health care provider, but
takes several days to  
respond.

iii. Impeding Innovations and Advancements in Access, Exchange, or Use  
  
  
  
or Health IT-enabled Care Delivery  
  
The information blocking provision encompasses practices that create
impediments to  
innovations and advancements to the access, exchange, and use of EHI,
including care delivery  
enabled by health IT (section 3022(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the PHSA).
Importantly, the information  
blocking provision would be implicated and penalties may apply if an
actor were to engage in  
exclusionary, discriminatory, or other practices that impede the
development, dissemination, or  
use of interoperable technologies and services that enhance access,
exchange, or use of EHI.  
  
Most acutely, the information blocking provision would be implicated if
an actor were to  
refuse to license or allow the disclosure of interoperability elements
to persons who require those  
elements to develop and provide interoperable technologies or
services—including those that  
might complement or compete with the actor’s own technology or services.
The same would be  
true if the actor were to allow access to interoperability elements but
were to restrict their use for  
these purposes. The following examples, which are not exhaustive,
illustrate practices that would  
likely implicate the information blocking provision by interfering with
access, exchange, or use  
of EHI:  
• A health IT developer of certified health IT refuses to license an
API’s interoperability  
elements, to grant the rights necessary to commercially distribute
applications that use the  
API’s interoperability elements, or to provide the related services
necessary to enable the use  
of such applications in production environments.

<span id="371"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **371** of **724**  
  
• An EHR developer of certified health IT requires third-party
applications to be “vetted” for  
security before use but does not promptly conduct the vetting or
conducts the vetting in a  
discriminatory or exclusionary manner.  
• A health IT developer of certified health IT refuses to license
interoperability elements that  
other software applications require to efficiently access, exchange, and
use EHI maintained  
in the developer’s technology.  
  
Rather than restricting interoperability elements, an actor may insist
on terms or  
conditions that are burdensome and discourage their use. These practices
would implicate the  
information blocking provision for the reasons described above. Consider
the following non-  
exhaustive examples:  
• An EHR developer of certified health IT maintains an “app store”
through which other  
developers can have “apps” listed that run natively on the EHR
developer’s platform.  
However, if an app “competes” with the EHR developer’s apps or apps it
plans to develop,  
the developer *requires* that the app developer grant the developer the
right to use the app’s  
source code.  
• A health care provider engages a systems integrator to develop an
interface engine. However,  
the provider’s license agreement with its EHR developer prohibits it
from disclosing  
technical documentation that the systems integrator needs to perform the
work. The EHR  
developer states that it will only permit the systems integrator to
access the documentation if  
all of its employees sign a broad non-compete agreement that would
effectively bar them  
from working for any other health IT companies.

-----

<span id="372"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **372** of **724**  
  
  
The information blocking provision would be implicated also if an actor
were to  
discourage efforts to develop or use interoperable technologies or
services by exercising its  
influence over customers, users, or other persons, as in the following
non-exhaustive examples:  
• An EHR developer of certified health IT maintains an “app store”
through which other  
developers can have “apps” listed that run natively on the EHR
developer’s platform. The  
EHR developer charges app developers a substantial fee for this service
unless an app  
developer agrees not to deploy the app in any other EHR developers’ app
stores.  
• A hospital is working with several health IT developers to develop an
application that will  
enable ambulatory providers who use different EHR systems to access and
update patient  
data in the hospital’s EHR system from within their ambulatory EHR
workflows. The  
inpatient EHR developer, being a health IT developer of certified health
IT, pressures the  
hospital to abandon this project, stating that if it does not it will no
longer receive the latest  
updates and features for its inpatient EHR system.  
• A health IT developer of certified health IT discourages customers
from procuring data  
integration capabilities from a third-party developer, claiming that it
will be providing such  
capabilities free of charge in the next release of its product. In
reality, the capabilities it is  
developing are more limited in scope and are still 12-18 months from
being production-  
ready.  
• A health system insists that local physicians adopt its EHR platform,
which provides limited  
connectivity with competing hospitals and facilities. The health system
threatens to revoke  
admitting privileges for physicians that do not comply.

Similar concerns would arise were an actor to engage in discriminatory
practices—such  
as imposing unnecessary and burdensome administrative, technical,
contractual, or other  
requirements on certain persons or classes of persons—that interfere
with access and exchange  
or EHI by frustrating or discouraging efforts to enable
interoperability. The following non-  
exhaustive examples illustrate some ways this could occur:  
• An HIN charges additional fees, requires more stringent testing or
certification requirements,  
or imposes additional terms for participants that are competitors, are
potential competitors, or  
may use EHI obtained via the HIN in a way that facilitates competition
with the HIN.  
• A health care provider imposes one set of fees and terms to establish
interfaces or data  
sharing arrangements with several registries and exchanges, but offers
another more costly or  
significantly onerous set of terms to establish substantially similar
interfaces and  
arrangements with an HIE or HIN that is used primarily by health plans
that purchase health  
care services from the provider at negotiated reduced rates.  
• A health IT developer of certified health IT charges customers fees,
throttles speeds, or limits  
the number of records they can export when exchanging EHI with a
regional HIE that  
supports exchange among users of competing health IT products, but does
not impose like  
fees or limitations when its customers exchange EHI with enterprise HIEs
that primarily  
serve users of the developer’s own technology.  
• As a condition of disclosing interoperability elements to third-party
developers, an EHR  
developer requires third-party developers to enter into business
associate agreements with all  
of the EHR developer’s covered entity customers, even if the work being
done is not for the  
benefit of the covered entities.

• A health IT developer of certified health IT takes significantly
longer to provide or update  
interfaces that facilitate the exchange of EHI with users of competing
technologies or  
services.  
  
We clarify that not all instances of differential treatment would
necessarily constitute a  
discriminatory practice that implicates the information blocking
provision. For example,  
different fee structures or other terms may reflect genuine differences
in the cost, quality, or  
value of the EHI and the effort required to provide access, exchange, or
use. We also note that, in  
certain circumstances, it may be reasonable and necessary for an actor
to restrict or impose  
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms or conditions on the use of
interoperability elements,  
even though such practices could implicate the information blocking
provision. For this reason,  
we propose in section VIII.D.6 of this preamble to establish a narrow
exception that would apply  
to these types of practices.  
  
  
  
iv. Rent-seeking and Other Opportunistic Pricing Practices  
Certain practices that artificially increase the cost and expense
associated with accessing,  
exchanging, and using EHI will implicate the information blocking
provision. Such practices are  
plainly contrary to the information blocking provision and the concerns
that motivated its  
enactment.  
An actor may seek to extract profits or capture revenue streams that
would be  
unobtainable without control of a technology or other interoperability
elements that are necessary  
to enable or facilitate access, exchange, or use of EHI. As discussed in
section VIII.C.5.b.iii of  
this proposed rule, most EHI is currently stored in EHRs and other
source systems that use  
proprietary data models or formats; this puts EHR developers (and other
actors that control data

models or standards) in a unique position to block access to (including
the export and portability  
of) EHI for use in competing systems or applications, or to charge rents
for access to the basic  
technical information needed to accomplish the access, exchange, or use
of EHI for these  
purposes. These information blocking concerns may be compounded to the
extent that EHR  
developers do not disclose, in advance, the fees they will charge for
interfaces, data export, data  
portability, and other interoperability-related services (*see* 80 FR
62719; 80 FR 16880–81). We  
note that these concerns are not limited to EHR developers. Other actors
who exercise substantial  
control over EHI or essential interoperability elements may engage in
analogous behaviors that  
would implicate the information blocking provision.  
To illustrate, we provide the following non-exhaustive examples, which
reflect some of  
the more common types of rent-seeking and opportunistic behaviors of
which we are aware and  
that are likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI:  
• An EHR developer of certified health IT charges customers a fee to
provide interfaces,  
connections, data export, data conversion or migration, or other
interoperability services,  
where the amount of the fee exceeds the actual costs that the developer
reasonably incurred  
to provide the services to the particular customer(s).  
• An EHR developer of certified health IT charges a fee to perform an
export using the EHI  
export capability proposed in § 170.315(b)(10) for the purposes of
switching health IT  
systems or to provide patients access to EHI.  
• An EHR developer of certified health IT charges more to export or use
EHI in certain  
situations or for certain purposes, such as when a customer is
transitioning to a competing  
technology or attempting to export data for use with a HIE, third-party
application, or other

technology or service that competes with the revenue opportunities
associated with the EHR  
developer’s own suite of products and services.  
• An EHR developer of certified health IT interposes itself between a
customer and a third-  
party developer, insisting that the developer pay a licensing fee,
royalty, or other payment in  
exchange for permission to access the EHR system or related
documentation, where the fee is  
not reasonably necessary to cover any additional costs the EHR developer
incurs from the  
third-party developer’s activities.  
• An analytics company provides services to the customers of an EHR
developer of certified  
health IT, including de-identifying customer EHI and combining it with
other data to identify  
areas for quality improvement. The EHR developer insists on a revenue
sharing arrangement  
whereby it would receive a percentage of the revenue generated from
these activities in  
return for facilitating access to its customers’ EHI, which turns out to
be disadvantageous to  
customers. The revenue the EHR developer would receive exceeds its
reasonable costs of  
facilitating the access to EHI.  
The information blocking provision would clearly be implicated by these
and other  
practices by which an actor profits from its unreasonable control over
EHI or interoperability  
elements without adding any efficiency to the health care system or
serving any other  
procompetitive purpose. But the reach of the information blocking
provision is not limited to  
these types of practices. We interpret the definition of information
blocking to encompass *any*  
fee that materially discourages or otherwise imposes a material
impediment to access, exchange,  
or use of EHI. We use the term “fee” in the broadest possible sense to
refer to any present or  
future obligation to pay money or provide any other thing of value and
propose to include this

definition in § 171.102. We believe this scope may be broader than
necessary to address genuine  
information blocking concerns and could unnecessarily diminish
investment and innovation in  
interoperable technologies and services. Therefore, as discussed in
section VIII.D.4 of this  
preamble, we propose to create an exception that, subject to certain
conditions, would permit the  
recovery of costs that are reasonably incurred to provide access,
exchange, and use of EHI. We  
refer readers to that section for additional details regarding this
proposal.  
  
  
  
v. Non-standard Implementation Practices  
  
Section 3022(a)(2)(B) of the PHSA states that information blocking may
include  
implementing health IT in non-standard ways that substantially increase
the complexity or  
burden of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI. In general, this type of
interference is likely to  
occur when, despite the availability of generally accepted technical,
policy, or other approaches  
that are suitable for achieving a particular implementation objective,
an actor does not implement  
the standard, does not implement updates to the standard, or implements
the standard in a way  
that materially deviates from its formal specifications. These practices
lead to unnecessary  
complexity and burden, such as the additional cost and effort required
to implement and maintain  
“point-to-point” connections, custom-built interfaces, and one-off trust
agreements.  
  
While each case will necessarily depend on its individual facts, and
while we recognize  
that the development and adoption of standards across the health IT
industry is an ongoing  
process, we propose that the information blocking provision would be
implicated in at least two  
distinct sets of circumstances. First, information blocking may arise
where an actor chooses not  
to adopt, or to materially deviate from, relevant standards,
implementation specifications, and  
certification criteria adopted by the Secretary under section 3004 of
the PHSA. Second, even

<span id="378"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **378** of **724**  
  
where no federally adopted or identified standard exists, if a
particular implementation approach  
has been broadly adopted in a relevant industry segment, deviations from
that approach would be  
suspect unless strictly necessary to achieve substantial efficiencies.  
To further illustrate these types of practices that would implicate the
information  
blocking provision, we provide the following non-exhaustive examples of
conduct that would be  
likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI:  
• An EHR developer of certified health IT implements the C-CDA for
receiving transitions of  
care summaries but only sends transitions of care summaries in a
proprietary or outmoded  
format.  
• A health IT developer of certified health IT adheres to the “required”
portions of a widely  
adopted industry standard but chooses to implement proprietary
approaches for “optional”  
parts of the standard when other interoperable means are readily
available.  
  
Even where no standards exist for a particular purpose, actors should
not design or  
implement health IT in non-standard ways that unnecessarily increase the
costs, complexity, and  
other burden of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI. For example, an EHR
developer of  
certified health IT designs its database tables in a way that is
unreasonably difficult to “map” to a  
non-proprietary format, which is a necessary prerequisite to converting
the EHI to a format that  
can be used in other software applications. When a customer requests the
capability to export  
EHI to a clinical data registry, the EHR developer quotes substantial
costs resulting from the  
need to write custom code to enable this functionality. Based on these
facts, the fees do not  
reflect costs that are reasonably incurred to provide the service and
are instead the result of the  
developer’s impractical design choices. We are aware that some actors
attribute certain non-

standard implementations on legacy systems that the actor did not
themselves design but which  
have to be integrated into the actor’s health IT. Such instances will be
considered on a case by  
case basis.  
Again, we reiterate that information blocking can take many forms and
that the practices  
(and categories of practices) described above do not provide an
exhaustive list or comprehensive  
description of practices that may implicate the information blocking
provision.  
6\. Applicability of Exceptions  
  
  
a. Reasonable and Necessary Activities  
  
As discussed above, section 3022(a)(3) authorizes the Secretary to
identify, through  
notice and comment rulemaking, reasonable and necessary *activities*
that do not constitute  
information blocking for purposes of the definition set forth in section
3022(a)(1). Separately,  
the Cures Act identifies at section 3022(a)(1) *practices* that
contravene the definition of  
information blocking. Following this Cures Act terminology, conduct that
implicates the  
information blocking provision and that does not fall within one of the
exceptions described in  
section VIII.D of this preamble, or does not meet all conditions for an
exception, would be  
considered a “practice.” Conduct that falls within an exception and
meets all the applicable  
conditions for that exception would be considered an “activity.” The
challenge with this  
distinction is that when examining conduct that is the subject of an
information blocking claim—  
an actor’s actions that likely interfered with access, exchange, or use
of EHI—it can be illusory  
to distinguish, on its face, conduct that is a *practice* and conduct
that is an *activity*. Indeed,  
conduct that implicates the information blocking provision but falls
within an exception could

nonetheless be considered information blocking in the event that the
actor has not satisfied the  
conditions applicable to that exception.  
  
While we acknowledge the terminology used in the Cures Act, we propose
to use the  
term “practice” throughout this proposed rule when we describe conduct
that is likely to interfere  
with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of
electronic health information,  
regardless of whether that conduct meets the conditions for an exception
to the information  
blocking provision. Consistent with this approach, when identifying
reasonable and necessary  
activities in §§ 171.200 through 171.206, we describe *practices* that,
if all the applicable  
conditions are met, are reasonable and necessary and not information
blocking. We have taken  
this approach, in part, because we believe that to adopt the terminology
of activity to describe  
conduct that may or may not be information blocking would confuse the
reader and obfuscate  
our intent in certain circumstances. As an illustration, a health care
provider may implement an  
organizational security policy that limits access, exchange, or use of
certain information to  
certain users (e.g. role-based access). Prior to determining whether the
implementation of the  
security policy is reasonable and necessary under the circumstances,
such conduct would be  
considered a “practice” that implicates the information blocking
provision. However, it may later  
be determined that such conduct is reasonable and necessary and would
then be considered an  
“activity.” Due to these types of scenarios, we contend that the better
approach is to use one  
term—practice—throughout the proposed rule and clarify when describing
the conduct at issue  
whether it is a practice that is information blocking, a practice that
implicates the information  
blocking provision, or a practice that is reasonable and necessary and
not information blocking.

The proposed exceptions would apply to health care providers, health IT
developers of  
certified health IT, HIEs, and HINs who engage in certain practices
covered by an exception,  
provided that all applicable conditions of the exception are satisfied
at all relevant times and for  
each practice for which the exception is sought. The exceptions are
generally applicable to all  
actors. However, in some instances we propose conditions within an
exception that apply to a  
particular type of actor.  
c. Establishing that Activities and Practices Meet the Conditions of an
Exception  
  
We propose that, in the event of an investigation of an information
blocking complaint,  
an actor must demonstrate that an exception is applicable and that the
actor met all relevant  
conditions of the exception at all relevant times and for each practice
for which the exception is  
sought. We consider this allocation of proof to be a substantive
condition of the proposed  
exceptions. As a practical matter, we propose that actors are in the
best position to demonstrate  
compliance with the conditions of the proposed exceptions and to produce
the detailed evidence  
necessary to demonstrate that compliance. We request comment about the
types of  
documentation and/or standardized methods that an actor may use to
demonstrate compliance  
with the exception conditions.  
*D. Proposed Exceptions to the Information Blocking Provision*  
  
We propose to establish seven exceptions to the information blocking
provision. The  
exceptions would apply to certain activities that may technically meet
the definition of  
information blocking but that are reasonable and necessary to further
the underlying public  
policies of the information blocking provision.  
****  
**NOTICE**

<span id="382"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **382** of **724**  
  
The seven proposed exceptions are based on three related policy
considerations. First,  
each exception is limited to certain activities that clearly advance the
aims of the information  
blocking provision. These reasonable and necessary activities include
providing appropriate  
protections to prevent harm to patients and others; promoting the
privacy and security of EHI;  
promoting competition and innovation in health IT and its use to provide
health care services to  
consumers, and to develop more efficient means of health care delivery;
and allowing system  
downtime in order to implement upgrades, repairs, and other changes to
health IT. Second, each  
exception addresses a significant risk that regulated actors will not
engage in these beneficial  
activities because of uncertainty concerning the breadth or
applicability of the information  
blocking provision. Finally, each exception is subject to strict
conditions to ensure that it is  
limited to activities that are reasonable and necessary.  
  
The first three exceptions, set forth in VIII.D.1-D.3, extend to certain
activities that are  
reasonable and necessary to prevent harm to patients and others; promote
the privacy of EHI;  
and promote the security of EHI, subject to strict conditions to prevent
the exceptions from being  
misused. We believe that without these exceptions, actors may be
reluctant to engage in the types  
of reasonable and necessary activities described below, and that this
could erode trust in the  
health IT ecosystem and undermine efforts to provide access and
facilitate the exchange and use  
of EHI for important purposes. Such a result would be contrary to the
purpose of the information  
blocking provision and the broader policies of the Cures Act.  
The next three exceptions, set forth in VIII.D.4-D.6, address activities
that are reasonable  
and necessary to promote competition and consumer welfare. First, we
propose to permit the  
recovery of certain types of reasonable costs incurred to provide
technology and services that

enable access to EHI and facilitate the exchange and use of that
information, provided certain  
conditions are met. Second, we propose to permit an actor to decline to
provide access,  
exchange, or use of EHI in a manner that is infeasible, subject to a
duty to provide a reasonable  
alternative. And, third, we propose an exception that would permit an
actor to license  
interoperability elements on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
These exceptions would  
be subject to strict conditions to ensure that they do not extend
protection to practices that raise  
information blocking concerns.  
The last exception, set forth in VIII.D.7, recognizes that it may be
reasonable and  
necessary for actors to make health IT temporarily unavailable for the
benefit of the overall  
performance of health IT. This exception would permit an actor to make
the operation of health  
IT unavailable in order to implement upgrades, repairs, and other
changes.  
As context for the exceptions proposed below in VIII.D.4-D.6, we note
that addressing  
information blocking is critical for promoting competition and
innovation in health IT and for the  
delivery of health care services to consumers. Indeed, the information
blocking provision itself  
expressly addresses practices that impede innovations and advancements
in health information  
access, exchange, and use, including care delivery enabled by health IT
(section  
3022(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the PHSA). As discussed in section VIII.C.5.b.iii
of this preamble, health IT  
developers of certified health IT, HIEs, HINs, and, in some instances,
health care providers may  
exploit their control over interoperability elements to create barriers
to entry for competing  
technologies and services that offer greater value for health IT
customers and users, provide new

or improved capabilities, and enable more robust access, exchange, and
use of EHI.[110](ONCs.html#384)More than  
this, information blocking may harm competition not just in health IT
markets, but also in  
markets for health care services.[111](ONCs.html#384) Dominant providers
in these markets may leverage their  
control over technology to limit patient mobility and
choice.[112](ONCs.html#384) They may also pressure  
independent providers to adopt expensive, hospital-centric technologies
that do not suit their  
workflows, limit their ability to share information with unaffiliated
providers, and make it  
difficult to adopt or use alternative technologies that could offer
greater efficiency and other  
benefits.[113](ONCs.html#384)The technological dependence resulting from
these practices can be a barrier to entry  
by would-be competitors. It can also make independent providers
vulnerable to acquisition or  
induce them into exclusive arrangements that enhance the market power of
incumbent providers,  
while preventing the formation of clinically-integrated products and
networks that offer more  
choice and better value to consumers and purchasers of health care
services.  
  
Section 3022(a)(5) of the PHSA provides that the Secretary may consult
with the Federal  
Trade Commission (FTC) in defining practices that do not constitute
information blocking  
because they are necessary to promote competition and consumer welfare.
We appreciate the  
expertise and informal technical assistance of FTC staff, which we have
taken into consideration

in developing the exceptions described in VIII.D.4-D.6 of this preamble.
We note that the  
language in the Cures Act regarding information blocking is
substantively and substantially  
different from the language and goals in the antitrust laws enforced by
the FTC. We view the  
Cures Act as authorizing ONC and OIG to regulate conduct that may be
considered permissible  
under the antitrust laws. On this basis, this proposed rule requires
that actors who control  
interoperability elements cooperate with individuals and entities that
require those elements for  
the purpose of developing, disseminating, and enabling technologies and
services that can  
interoperate with the actor’s technology.  
We emphasize that ONC is taking this approach because we view patients
as having an  
overwhelming interest in EHI about themselves, and particularly
observational health  
information (see the discussion in section VIII.C.4.b of this preamble).
As such, access to EHI,  
and the EHI itself, should not be traded or sold by those actors who are
custodians of EHI or who  
control its access, exchange, or use. We emphasize that such actors
should not be able to charge  
fees for providing electronic access, exchange, or use of patients’ EHI.
We propose that actors  
should be required to share EHI unless they are prohibited from doing so
under an existing law  
or are covered by one of the exceptions detailed in this preamble. In
addition, any remedy sought  
or action taken by HHS under the information blocking provision would be
independent from the  
antitrust laws and would not prevent FTC or DOJ from taking action with
regard to the same  
actor or conduct.  
  
We request comment on the following seven proposed exceptions, including
whether  
they will achieve our stated policy goals.  
1\. Preventing Harm

Federal Register (OFR) for publication and  
has not yet been placed on public display or published in the Federal

<span id="386"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **386** of **724**  
  
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking
provision for practices  
that are reasonable and necessary to prevent harm to a patient or
another person, provided certain  
conditions are met. The exception and corresponding conditions are set
forth in the proposed  
regulation text in § 171.201.  
  
This proposed exception would acknowledge the public interest in
protecting patients and  
other persons against unreasonable risks of harm that, in certain
narrowly defined circumstances  
described below, justify practices that are likely to interfere with
access, exchange, or use of EHI  
and that would implicate the information blocking provision in the
absence of an exception.  
The exception would be subject to strict conditions, which we believe
are necessary to  
prevent patient safety from being used as a pretext for information
blocking or as a post hoc  
rationalization for practices that are not reasonable and necessary to
address material risks of  
harm to a patient or another person.  
  
We have adopted the terminology of “patient” to denote the context in
which the threat of  
harm arises. That is, this proposed exception has been designed to
recognize certain practices  
taken for the benefit of recipients of health care—those individuals
whose EHI is at issue—and  
other persons whose information may be recorded in that EHI or who may
be at risk of harm  
because of the access, use, or exchange of EHI. The use of the term
“patient” does not require,  
other than in the context of the risk of harm determined by a
licensed[health
care](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=0bf30072cd447089063e3f884e42f705&term_occur=1&term_src=Title:45:Chapter:A:Subchapter:C:Part:164:Subpart:E:164.524)professional  
(*see* § 171.201(a)(3)), that an actor seeking to benefit from this
exception needs to have a  
clinician-patient relationship with the individual (or individuals) at
risk of harm. Indeed, a health  
IT developer of certified health IT would be able to benefit from this
exception in connection  
with practices undertaken for the benefit of individuals receiving (or
having received, or

expected to receive) care from a health care provider that uses the
developer’s health IT.  
Similarly, an HIE or HIN that exchanges or facilitates the exchange of
EHI would be able to  
benefit from this exception in connection with the activities carried
out by the HIE or HIN for or  
at the direction of a health care provider.  
*Patient harm risks that would be cognizable under this exception.*  
  
Consistent with the definition of information blocking, we have
identified certain risks to  
patient harm that arise in the context of access, exchange, or use of
EHI. To qualify for this  
proposed exception, an actor’s practice must respond to a risk that is
cognizable under this  
exception.  
  
*Risk of* *corrupt or inaccurate data being recorded or incorporated in
a patient’s*  
*electronic health record*  
  
The exception may apply to practices that prevent harm arising from
corrupted or  
inaccurate EHI being recorded or incorporated in a patient’s electronic
health record. Users of  
health IT systems strive to maintain accurate electronic health records
by carefully inputting EHI  
and verifying existing EHI. Occasionally a clinician or other user of
health IT is presented with  
EHI that, due to a failure of the technology, is either entirely
incorrect or contains inaccurate  
information. At other times, EHI could become corrupted. In these cases,
the sharing or  
integration of such EHI could lead to inaccuracies in the patient’s
electronic health record that  
then run the risk of being propagated further. We note, however, that
known inaccuracies in  
some data within a record may not be sufficient justification to
withhold the entire record if the  
remainder of the patient’s EHI could be effectively shared without also
presenting the known  
incorrect or corrupted information as if it were trustworthy. Also, we
would expect that once

<span id="388"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **388** of **724**  
  
information is known to be inaccurate or corrupted, a health care
provider holding that record  
would, for example, take action to cure the inaccuracy or corruption. We
understand that in the  
ordinary course of practice, and consistent with professional and legal
standards for clinical  
record keeping, health care providers take appropriate action to
remediate known problems with  
EHI and restore a record as a whole to be safely usable, and therefore
safely sharable.  
This recognized risk is limited to corruption and inaccuracies caused by
performance and  
technical issues affecting health IT. For example, this exception may be
relevant if certified  
health IT were to incorrectly present an old and superseded version of a
medication list, or when  
only partial copies of laboratory tests are being linked to a patient
when the patient’s record is  
exchanged. However, this recognized risk does not extend to purported
accuracy issues arising  
from the incompleteness of a patient’s electronic health record
generally. Electronic health  
records, like the paper charts they replaced, are inevitably imperfect
records. Many patients see  
multiple health care providers and so it is unlikely that any single
health care provider’s record  
will provide a complete picture of a patient’s health. Some patients
intentionally keep certain  
information secret even from their health care providers, and others
fail to share potentially  
critical information with their health care providers because they
forget to, or simply do not  
understand its clinical significance.  
While the access, exchange, or use of EHI in these situations could give
rise to the risk of  
harm if the EHI was relied on without qualification, such reliance does
not accord with our  
understanding of clinical practice, as the risk of incompleteness
resulting from patients having  
multiple providers, or from errors of omission by patients and their
care providers, is not unique  
to electronic health records or their interoperable exchange. Therefore,
the risk that the EHI a

given health care provider holds for a given patient may not be a
perfectly complete record of  
that patient’s health or care will not be recognized as being sufficient
to support an actor  
qualifying for this exception in the face of a claim of information
blocking.  
We also acknowledge that certain federal and state laws, such as 42 CFR
part 2 and state  
medical record laws, require an actor to obtain an individual’s written
consent before sharing  
health information. However, we propose that an actor would not be able
to benefit from this  
exception on the basis of a perceived risk arising from exchanging or
providing access to EHI  
when the EHI exchanged or made accessible does not include certain
information due to a  
patient’s decision not to consent to its disclosure. For example, this
exception would not  
recognize an actor’s conduct in not providing access, exchange, or use
of a patient’s electronic  
health record on the basis that the patient’s failure to consent to the
disclosure of substance abuse  
treatment information made the patient’s record incomplete and thus
inaccurate.  
*Risk of misidentifying a patient or patient’s electronic health
information*  
  
The exception may apply to practices that are designed to promote data
quality and  
integrity and support health IT applications properly identifying and
matching patient records or  
EHI. Accurately identifying patients and correctly attributing their EHI
to them is a complex task  
and involves layers of safeguards, including verification of a patient’s
identity, proper  
registration in health IT systems, physical identification such as
wristbands, and usability and  
implementation decisions such as ensuring the display of a patient’s
name and date of birth on  
every screen of the patient’s electronic chart. When a clinician or
other health IT user may know  
or reasonably suspect that specific EHI in a patient’s record is or may
be misattributed, either  
within a local record or as received through EHI exchange, it would be
reasonable for them to

avoid sharing or incorporating the EHI that they know would, or
reasonably suspect could,  
propagate errors in the patient’s records and thus pose the attendant
risks to the patient. As  
discussed below, an actor’s response to this risk would need to be no
broader than necessary to  
mitigate the risk of harm arising from the potentially misidentified
record or misattributed data.  
A health IT developer of certified health IT could not, for example,
refuse to provide a batch  
export on the basis that the exported records may contain a
misidentified record. Similarly, a  
health care provider that identified that a particular piece of
information had been misattributed  
to a patient would not be excused from exchanging or providing access to
all other EHI about the  
patient that had not been misattributed.  
*Determination by a licensed health care professional that the
disclosure of EHI is*  
*reasonably likely to endanger life or physical safety*  
  
The exception may permit certain restrictions on the disclosure of an
individual’s EHI in  
circumstances where a licensed[health

certain cases, the clinician may have individualized knowledge stemming
from the clinician-

result if certain EHI were shared or transmitted electronically.

applicable federal or state laws

We request comment on whether the categories of harm described above
capture the full  
range of safety risks that might arise directly from accessing,
exchanging, or using EHI. We also  
request comment on whether we should consider other types of patient
safety risks related to data  
quality and integrity concerns, or that may have a less proximate
connection to EHI but that  
could provide a reasonable and necessary basis for an actor to restrict
or otherwise impede  
access, exchange, or use of EHI in appropriate circumstances. We ask
that commenters provide  
detailed rationale for any suggested revisions to these categories,
including additional conditions  
that may be necessary to ensure that the exception is tailored and does
not extend protection to  
practices that are not reasonable and necessary to promote patient
safety and that could present  
information blocking concerns.  
*Reasonable belief that practice was necessary to directly and

To qualify for this exception, an actor must have had a reasonable
belief that the practice  
or practices will directly and substantially reduce the likelihood of
harm to a patient or another  
person. As discussed above, the type of risk must also be cognizable
under this exception.  
An actor could meet this condition in two ways.

In most cases, we anticipate that the actor would demonstrate that the
practices it engaged  
in were consistent with an organizational policy that was objectively

than necessary for the type of patient safety risks at issue. In these
circumstances, we propose  
that an actor’s policy would need to satisfy the following
requirements.  
  
First, we propose that the policy must be in writing. Second, it must
have been developed  
with meaningful input from clinical, technical, and other appropriate
staff or others who have  
expertise or insight relevant to the risk of harm that the policy
addresses. This condition would  
not be met if, for example, a hospital imposed top-down information
sharing policies or  
workflows established by the hospital’s EHR developer and approved by
hospital administrators  
without meaningful input from the medical staff, IT department, and
front-line clinicians who  
would implement, and thus be affected by, the policy and are in the best
position to gauge how  
effective it will be at mitigating patient safety risks.  
  
Third, we propose that the policy must have been implemented in a
consistent and non-  
discriminatory manner. As part of this condition, the actor must have
taken reasonable steps to  
educate its directors, officers, employees, contractors, and authorized
personnel on how to apply  
the policy and to provide appropriate oversight to ensure that the
policy is not applied in an  
arbitrary, discriminatory, or otherwise inappropriate manner. This
condition would not be met if,  
for example, a policy or practice were based on factors that lacked a
direct and substantial  
correlation with the particular risk of harm at issue.  
Last, we propose that the policy must have been be no broader than
necessary for the  
specific risk or type of risk at issue. . For example, as evidence that
the policy is no broader than  
necessary, the policy would need to identify the relevant risks and
follow an approach to  
mitigating those risks that is based on current patient safety evidence
and best practices,  
supplemented by input from clinical, technical, and other staff or
others who are in the best

position to make judgments about the policy’s effectiveness, as
discussed above. Further  
evidence that the policy was no broader than necessary would be whether
the actor considered  
alternative approaches and reasonably concluded that, under the
circumstances, those approaches  
were either inadequate to address the identified risks of harm or would
not have reduced the  
likelihood of interference with access, exchange, or use of EHI. For
example, a tailored response  
to the existence of corrupted data would necessarily permit all
uncorrupted EHI to continue to be  
accessed, used, and exchanged. This condition would not be met, for
example, if an actor’s  
policy imposed a blanket ban on the sharing of EHI with users of
different technologies or with  
health care providers who are not part of a particular health system,
HIE, or HIN.  
*Qualifying individualized finding*  
We recognize that some health care providers (such as small practices)
may not have  
comprehensive and formal policies governing all aspects of EHI and
patient safety. Additionally,  
even if an organizational policy exists, it may not anticipate all of
the potential risks of harm that  
could arise in real-world clinical or production environments of health
IT. In these  
circumstances, in lieu of demonstrating that a practice conformed to the
actor’s policies and that  
the policies met the conditions described above, the actor could justify
the practice or practices  
directly by making a finding in each case, based on the particularized
facts and circumstances,  
that the practice is necessary and no broader than necessary to mitigate
the risk of harm. To do  
so, we propose that the actor would need to show that the practices were
approved on a case-by-  
case basis by an individual with direct knowledge of the relevant facts
and circumstances and  
who had relevant clinical, technical, or other appropriate expertise.
Such an individual would  
need to reasonably conclude, on the basis of those particularized facts
and circumstances and

his/her expertise and best professional judgment, that the practice was
necessary, and no broader  
than necessary, to mitigate the risk of harm to a patient or other
persons.  
  
We propose that a licensed health care professional’s independent and
individualized  
judgment about the safety of the actor’s patients or other persons would
be entitled to substantial  
deference under this proposed exception. So long as the clinician
actually considered all of the  
relevant facts and determined that, under the particular circumstances,
the practice was necessary  
to protect the safety of the clinician’s patient or other person, we
would not second-guess the  
clinician’s judgment. To provide further clarity on this point, we
provide the following  
illustration.  
  
A clinician suspects that a patient is at risk of domestic abuse. The
patient has recently  
visited the clinic for a pregnancy test, and tells the clinician that
the potential father is not her  
current partner. The test returns a positive result. The clinician notes
that in the patient’s  
electronic health record, her partner has been given access to view her
test results. The clinician,  
considering all factors for this particular situation and particular
patient, and aware of the clinic’s  
policy towards the restriction of electronic health information sharing,
concludes that releasing  
this result electronically could place the patient at risk of harm. The
clinician thus chooses not to  
release the test result electronically and plans to deliver the result
to the patient in a safe manner.  
The exception would apply in this case because the clinician reasonably
believes, based on the  
relationship with this particular patient and the clinician’s best
clinical judgment, that the  
restriction is necessary to prevent harm to the patient.  
  
We seek public comment on whether this proposed exception is appropriate
and  
adequately balances the interest of promoting access, exchange, and use
of EHI with legitimate

concerns about the risk of harm to patients and others. In addition to
any other relevant issues,  
we specifically request feedback on whether the exception is broad
enough to prevent harm to  
patients and others and, if not, what additional risks we should address
should we finalize this  
proposal; and whether there are additional safeguards the Secretary
should adopt in order to  
prevent practices that attempt to undermine the policy goal of the
exception. We also seek  
comment on whether there are customary practices (e.g., standards of
care) that advance patient  
safety concerns but which actors do not, as a matter of practice, record
in documented policies,  
and which should be taken into account when assessing the reasonableness
of a practice under  
this exception.  
2\. Promoting the Privacy of EHI  
  
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking
provision for practices  
that are reasonable and necessary to protect the privacy of an
individual’s EHI, provided certain  
conditions are met. The exception and corresponding conditions are set
forth in the proposed  
regulation text in § 171.202. We note that any practice engaged in to
protect the privacy of an  
individual’s EHI must be consistent with applicable laws related to
health information privacy,  
including the HIPAA Privacy Rule as applicable, as well as with other
applicable laws and  
regulations, such as the HITECH Act, 42 CFR part 2, and state laws. This
exception to the  
information blocking provision does not alter an actor’s obligation to
comply with these and  
other applicable laws.  
  
We believe this exception is necessary to support basic trust and
confidence in health IT  
infrastructure. Without this exception, there would be a significant
risk that actors would share  
EHI in inappropriate circumstances, such as when an individual has taken
affirmative steps to

<span id="396"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **396** of **724**  
  
request that the EHI not be shared, or when an actor has been unable to
obtain reasonable  
assurances as to an individual’s identity.  
In contrast to the other exceptions defined in this proposed rule, this
proposed exception  
has been structured with discrete “sub-exceptions.” An actor’s practice
must qualify for a sub-  
exception in order to be covered by this exception. The sub-exceptions
have, to a large extent,  
been crafted to closely mirror privacy-protective practices that are
recognized under state and  
federal privacy laws. In this way, the privacy sub-exceptions to the
information blocking  
provision would recognize as reasonable and necessary practices that are
engaged in by actors  
consistent with privacy laws, provided that certain conditions are met.
We have proposed four  
sub-exceptions that address the following privacy protective practices:
(1) not providing access,  
exchange, or use of EHI when a state or federal law requires that a
condition be satisfied before  
an actor provides access, exchange, or use of EHI, and the condition is
not satisfied (proposed in  
§ 171.202(b)); (2) not providing access, exchange, or use of EHI when
the actor is a health IT  
developer of certified health IT that is not covered by the HIPAA
Privacy Rule in respect to a  
practice (proposed in § 171.202(c)); (3) a covered entity, or a business
associate on behalf of a  
covered entity, denying an individual’s request for access to their
electronic PHI in the  
circumstances provided in 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1), (2), or (3) (proposed at
§ 171.202(d)); and (4)  
not providing access, exchange, or use of EHI pursuant to an
individual’s request, in certain  
situations (proposed in § 171.202(e)). The rationale for each
sub-exception is described in detail  
below.  
An actor would need to satisfy at least one sub-exception in order that
a purportedly  
privacy-protective practice that interferes with access, exchange, or
use of EHI not be subject to

the information blocking provision. Each sub-exception has conditions
that must be met in order  
that an actor’s practice qualifies for protection under the
sub-exception.  
*Specific terminology used for the purposes of this proposed
exception*  
  
We note that this proposed exception and our discussion below uses
certain terms that are  
defined by the HIPAA Rules[114](ONCs.html#397)but that, for purposes of
this exception, may have a broader  
meaning in the context of the information blocking provision and its
implementing regulations as  
set forth in this Proposed Rule. In general, the terms “access,”
“exchange,” and “use” have the  
meaning explained in section VIII.C.4.a of this preamble. However, in
some instances we refer  
to “use” in the context of a disclosure or use of ePHI under the HIPAA
Privacy Rule, in which  
case we have explicitly stated that the term “use” has the meaning
defined in 45 CFR 160.103.  
Similarly, we refer in a few cases to an individual’s right of access
under 45 CFR 164.524, in  
which case the term “access” should be understood in that HIPAA Privacy
Rule context. For  
purposes of section 3022 of the PHSA, however, the term “access”
includes, but is broader than,  
an individual’s access to their PHI as provided for by the HIPAA Privacy
Rule (see section  
VIII.C.4.a of this preamble). ****  
  
Finally, the term “individual” is defined by the HIPAA Rules at 45 CFR
160.103.  
Separately, under the information blocking enforcement provision, the
term “individual” is used  
to refer to actors that are health IT developers of certified health IT,
HINs, or HIEs, (*see* section  
3022(b)(2)(A) of the PHSA). For purposes of this exception (and only
this exception), we use  
neither of these definitions. Instead, the term “individual” encompasses
any or all of the  
following: (1) an individual defined by 45 CFR 160.103; (2) a person who
is the subject of EHI  
  
114 45 CF[R

that is being accessed, exchanged or used; (3) a person who legally acts
on behalf of an  
individual or person described in (1) or (2), including as a personal
representative, in accordance  
with 45 CFR 164.502(g); or (4) a legal representative authorized to make
health care decisions  
on behalf of a person or an executor or administrator who can act on
behalf of the deceased’s  
estate under state or other law.  
We clarify that (2) varies from (1) because there could be individuals
who could be the  
subject of EHI that is being accessed, exchanged, or used under (2), but
who would not be the  
subject of PHI under (1). The purpose of (2) is to include EHI that
would be accessed, exchanged  
or used by entities that are not subject to HIPAA (e.g., non-covered
entities and non-business  
associates). These entities could include, for example, health IT
developers or data analytics  
companies that have access to EHI, but are not business associates.  
We also clarify that (3) encompasses a person with *legal* authority to
act on behalf of the  
individual, which includes a person who is a personal representative as
defined under the HIPAA  
Privacy Rule. We included the component of *legal* authority to act in
(3) because the HIPAA  
Privacy Rule gives rights to parents or legal guardians in certain
circumstances where they are  
not the “personal representative” for their child(ren). For instance, a
non-custodial parent who  
has requested a minor child’s medical records under a court-ordered
divorce decree may have  
legal authority to act on behalf of the child even if he or she is not
the child’s “personal  
representative.” Further, in limited circumstances and if permitted
under state law, a family  
member may have *legal* authority to act on behalf of a patient to make
health care decisions in

emergency situations even if that family member may not be the “legal
representative” or  
“personal representative” of the patient.  
We have adopted this specialized usage to ensure that this privacy
exception extends  
protection to information about, and respects the privacy preferences
of, *all* individuals, not only  
those individuals whose EHI is protected as ePHI by HIPAA covered
entities and business  
associates.  
*Interaction between information blocking, the exception for promoting
the privacy of EHI, and*  
*the HIPAA Privacy Rule*  
Having consulted extensively with the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR),
who enforce  
the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules, we have
developed the information  
blocking provision to advance our shared goals of preventing information
blocking for nefarious  
or self-interested purposes while maintaining and upholding existing
privacy rights and  
protections for individuals. The proposed exception for promoting the
privacy of EHI (also  
referred to as “the privacy exception”) operates in a manner consistent
with the framework of the  
HIPAA Privacy Rule. We designed these exceptions to ensure that
individual privacy rights are  
not diminished as a consequence of the information blocking provision,
and to ensure that the  
information blocking provision does not require the use or disclosure of
EHI in a way that would  
not be permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Our intent is that the
information blocking  
provision does not conflict with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Indeed, the
sub-exception proposed in  
§ 171.202(d) reflects a policy judgment that an actor’s denial of access
to an individual  
consistent with the limited conditions for such denials that are
described in the HIPAA Privacy  
Rule at 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1), (2), and (3) is reasonable under the
circumstances. We believe

this resolves any potential conflict between limitations on an
individual’s right of access under  
the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the information blocking provision.  
We note that the information blocking provision may operate to require
that actors  
provide access, exchange, or use of EHI in situations that HIPAA does
not. This is because the  
HIPAA Privacy Rule permits, but does not require, covered entities to
use and disclose ePHI in  
most circumstances. The information blocking provision, on the other
hand, requires that an  
actor provide access to, exchange, or use of EHI unless they are
prohibited from doing so under  
an existing law or are covered by one of the exceptions detailed in this
preamble. To illustrate,  
the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits health care providers to exchange ePHI
for treatment purposes,  
but does not require them to do so. Under the information blocking
provision, unless an  
exception to information blocking applies, or the interference is
required by law, a primary care  
provider would be required to exchange ePHI with a specialist who
requests it to treat an  
individual who was a common patient of the provider and the specialist,
even if the primary care  
provider offered patient care services in competition with the
specialist’s practice, or would  
usually refer its patients to another specialist due to an existing
business relationship.  
*Promoting patient privacy rights*  
As discussed above, the information blocking provision would not require
that actors  
provide access, exchange, or use of EHI in a manner that is not
permitted under the HIPAA  
Privacy Rule or other privacy laws. As such, the privacy-protective
controls existing under  
HIPAA would not be weakened by the information blocking provision.
Moreover, we have  
structured the privacy exception to ensure that actors can engage in
reasonable and necessary  
practices that advance the privacy interests of individuals.

<span id="401"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **401** of **724**  
  
For example, we believe that, unless required by law, actors should not
be compelled to  
share EHI against patients’ wishes or without adequate safeguards out of
a concern that  
restricting the access, exchange, or use of the EHI would constitute
information blocking. This  
could seriously undermine patients’ trust and confidence in the privacy
of their EHI and diminish  
the willingness of patients, providers, and other entities to provide or
maintain health information  
electronically in the first place. In addition, such outcomes would
undermine and not advance the  
goals of the information blocking provision and be inconsistent with the
broader policy goal of  
the Cures Act to facilitate trusted exchange of EHI. Trusted exchange
requires not only that EHI  
be shared in accordance with applicable law, but also that it be shared
in a manner that  
effectuates individuals’ expressed privacy preferences. We note and
discuss below that an  
individual’s expressed privacy preferences will not be controlling in
all cases. An actor will not  
be able to rely on an individual’s expressed privacy preference in
circumstances where the  
access, exchange, or use is required by law.  
For these reasons, we propose that the proposed sub-exception in §
171.202(e) would  
generally permit an actor to give effect to individuals’ expressed
privacy preferences, including  
their desire not to permit access, exchange, or use of their EHI. For
example, provided that  
corresponding conditions have been met, a health care provider could
honor a patient’s request  
not to share their EHI in circumstances in which the HIPAA Privacy Rule
would permit (though  
not require) the provider to disclose the information, such as for
treatment purposes. At the same  
time, however, we believe that the privacy exception must be tailored to
ensure that protection of  
an individual’s privacy is not used as a pretext for information
blocking. Accordingly, we

<span id="402"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **402** of **724**  
  
propose that this exception, which is discussed more fully below, would
be subject to strict  
conditions.  
*Privacy Practices Required by Law*  
Because the information blocking provision excludes from the definition
of information  
blocking practices that are required by law (section 3022(a)(1) of the
PHSA), privacy-protective  
practices that are required by law do not implicate the information
blocking provision and do not  
require coverage from an exception. For example, the HIPAA Privacy Rule
requires that a  
covered entity must agree to the request of an individual to restrict
disclosure of protected health  
information (PHI) about the individual to a health plan if the
disclosure is for the purpose of  
carrying out payment or health care operations and not otherwise
required by law and the PHI  
pertains solely to a health care item or service for which the
individual, or person other than the  
health plan on behalf of the individual, has paid the covered entity in
full.[115](ONCs.html#402)If an individual  
made such a request and met all requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule,
the actor would be  
*required by law* not to exchange the individual’s EHI to a health plan.
In this situation, the  
actor’s interference with access, exchange, or use would not be
information blocking and as  
such, the actor would not need to benefit from this exception.  
Practices that are “required by law” can be distinguished from other
practices that an  
actor engages in pursuant to a privacy law, but which are not “required
by law.” Such privacy  
laws are typically framed in a way that conditions the making of a
“disclosure” on the satisfying  
of specific conditions, but does not expressly require that the actor
engage in a practice that  
interferes with access, exchange, or use of EHI. For example, the HIPAA
Privacy Rule provides  
  
115 45 CFR 164.522(a)(1)(vi).

that a covered entity *may* use or disclose PHI in certain circumstances
where the individual  
concerned has authorized the disclosure.[116](ONCs.html#403)The effect
of this requirement is that the covered  
entity should not use or disclose the PHI in the absence of an
individual’s authorization.  
However, because the requirement does not prohibit the actor from
exchanging the EHI in all  
circumstances, the actor would be at risk of engaging in a practice that
was information blocking  
unless an exception applied. For this reason, we have included a
sub-exception, addressed in §  
171.202(b) and discussed below, that provides that an actor will not be
engaging in information  
blocking if a state or federal privacy law imposes a precondition to the
provision of access,  
exchange, or use, and that precondition has not been satisfied.  
*Sub-exception to proposed privacy exception: Precondition not
satisfied*  
  
State and federal privacy laws that permit the disclosure of PHI often
impose conditions  
that must be satisfied prior to a disclosure being made. We propose to
establish a sub-exception  
to the information blocking provision that recognizes that an actor will
not be engaging in  
information blocking if an actor does not provide access, exchange, or
use of EHI because a  
necessary precondition required by law has not been satisfied. This
exception will apply to all  
instances where an actor’s ability to provide access, exchange, or use
is “controlled” by a legal  
obligation to satisfy a condition, or multiple conditions, prior to
providing that access, exchange,  
or use. To be covered by this exception, the actor must comply with
conditions, which are  
discussed below.  
The nature of the preconditions that an actor must satisfy in order to
provide access,  
exchange, or use of EHI will depend on the privacy laws that regulate
the actor. An actor that is

regulated by a restrictive state privacy law may need to satisfy more
conditions than an actor  
regulated by a less restrictive state privacy law, before providing
access, exchange, or use.  
Similarly, certain state privacy laws may impose standards for meeting
preconditions that are  
more rigorous than the laws in force elsewhere.  
To illustrate how we propose this sub-exception would operate, we
provide the following  
examples. We note that this list of examples is not exhaustive and that
preconditions required by  
law that control access, exchange, or use of EHI that are not listed
below would still qualify  
under this proposed sub-exception so long as all conditions are met.  
• Certain federal and state laws require that a person provide consent
before his or her EHI  
can be accessed, exchanged, or used for specific purposes. Although the
HIPAA Privacy  
Rule does not have consent requirements for an individual (as that term
is defined in the  
HIPAA Privacy Rule) when a covered entity or business associate is using
or disclosing  
ePHI for treatment, payment or health care operations, some state laws
and federal laws and  
regulations do require that a person’s consent be obtained by the
disclosing party/entity  
before disclosing certain health information. For example, for some
sensitive health  
conditions such as HIV/AIDS, mental health, or genetic testing, state
laws may impose a  
higher standard for disclosure of such information (i.e., require
consent) than is required  
under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Additionally, under 42 CFR part 2,
federally-assisted “Part  
2 programs” generally are required to obtain a person’s consent to
disclose or re-disclose  
patient-identifying information related to the person’s substance use
disorder, such as  
treatment for addiction. The exception would operate to clarify an
actor’s compliance  
obligations in these situations. It would not be considered information
blocking to refuse to

provide access, exchange, or use of EHI if the actor has not received
the person’s consent,  
subject to conditions discussed herein.  
• If an actor is required by law to obtain an individual’s HIPAA
authorization before  
providing access, exchange, or use of the individual’s EHI, then the
individual’s refusal to  
provide an authorization would justify the actor’s refusal to provide
access, exchange, or use  
of EHI. The actor’s refusal would, subject to conditions discussed
herein, be protected under  
this exception.  
• The HIPAA Privacy Rule, and many state privacy laws, authorize the
disclosure of PHI in  
certain circumstances only once the identity and authority of the person
requesting the  
information has been verified. We acknowledge that it is reasonable and
necessary that  
actors take appropriate steps, consistent with federal and state laws,
to ensure that EHI is not  
disclosed to the wrong person or to a person who is not authorized to
receive it. Where an  
actor cannot verify the identity or authority of a person requesting
access to EHI, and such  
verification is required by law before the actor can provide access,
exchange, or use of the  
EHI, the actor’s refusal to provide access, exchange, or use will,
subject to the conditions  
discussed herein, be reasonable and necessary and will not be
information blocking.  
• Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, a health care provider may share
information with another  
health care provider for a quality improvement project if it has
verified that the requesting  
entity has a relationship with the person whose information is being
requested. Where the  
actor could not establish if the relationship existed, it would not be
information blocking for  
the actor to refuse to provide access, exchange, or use, subject to the
conditions discussed  
herein.

We seek comments generally on this proposed sub-exception. More
specifically, we seek  
comment on how this proposed sub-exception would be exercised by actors
in the context of  
state laws. We are aware that actors that operate across state lines or
in multiple jurisdictions  
sometimes adopt organization-wide privacy practices that conform with
the most restrictive  
privacy laws regulating their business. In order to ensure that the
information blocking provision  
does not diminish the privacy rights of individuals being serviced by
such actors, we are  
considering the inclusion of an accommodation in this sub-exception that
would recognize an  
actor’s observance of a legal precondition that the actor is required by
law to satisfy in at least  
one state in which it operates. We believe this approach would be
consistent with practices  
already in place for multi-state health care systems. For example, some
states require specific  
consent requirements before exchanging sensitive health information such
as a patient’s mental  
health condition. As a result, the health care system will utilize one
consent form for multi-  
jurisdiction purposes in order to meet various federal and state law
requirements. However, in  
the event that we did adopt such an accommodation, we would also need to
carefully consider  
how to ensure that before the use of the most stringent restriction is
applied in all jurisdictions,  
the actor has provided all privacy protections afforded by that law
across its entire business. This  
type of approach would ensure that an actor cannot take advantage of a
more-restrictive privacy  
law for the benefit of this exception while not also fulfilling the
privacy-protective obligations of  
the law being relied on. We seek comment on whether there is a need for
ONC to adopt such an  
accommodation for actors operating in multiple states, and encourage
commenters to identify  
any additional conditions that should attach to the provision of such an
accommodation. We also

request comment on our proposed approach to dealing with varying state
privacy laws  
throughout this proposed sub-exception.  
We also recognize that under the patchwork of state privacy laws, some
states have  
enacted laws that more comprehensively identify the circumstance in
which an individual or  
entity can and cannot provide access, exchange, or use of EHI. We are
considering to what  
extent health care providers that are not regulated by the HIPAA Privacy
Rule, and would rely  
instead on state laws for this sub-exception, would be able to benefit
from this sub-exception  
when engaging in practices that interfere with access, exchange, or use
of EHI for the purpose of  
promoting patient privacy. We seek comment on any challenges that may be
encountered by  
health care providers that are not regulated as covered entities under
the HIPAA Privacy Rule  
when seeking to take advantage of this proposed sub-exception. We also
seek comment on  
whether there exists a class of health care provider that is not
regulated by *any* federal or state  
privacy law that prescribes preconditions that must be satisfied in
connection with the disclosure  
of EHI, and whether any such class of health care provider would benefit
from a sub-exception  
similar to that proposed in § 171.202(c) for health IT developers of
certified health IT.  
*Conditions to be met to qualify for the sub-exception*  
In most circumstances, an actor would be in a position to influence
whether a  
precondition is satisfied. For example, an actor could deprive a person
of the opportunity to take  
some step that is a prerequisite for the exchange of their EHI, could
assume the existence of a  
fact prejudicial to the granting of access without seeking to discover
the truth or otherwise of the  
fact, or could make a determination that a precondition was not
satisfied without properly  
informing itself of all relevant information. As such, we propose that
this exception would be

subject to conditions that ensure that the protection of an individual’s
privacy is not used as a  
pretext for information blocking.  
We propose that an actor can qualify, in part, for this sub-exception by
implementing and  
conforming to organizational policies and procedures that identify the
criteria to be used by the  
actor and, as applicable, the steps that the actor will take, in order
to satisfy the precondition.  
Most actors are covered entities or business associates for the purposes
of the HIPAA Privacy  
Rule, and are already required to have policies and procedures and
training programs in place  
that address how PHI and ePHI is used (as that term is defined in 45 CFR
160.103, as amended)  
and disclosed. As such, we expect that the overwhelming majority of
actors will already be in a  
position to meet this condition, or would be able to meet this condition
with modest additional  
effort. However, we acknowledge that some actors may not, for whatever
reason, have privacy  
policies and practices in place, or may have implemented privacy
policies and practices that do  
not sufficiently address the criteria to be used, and steps to be taken,
to satisfy a precondition  
relied on by the actor. As such, we propose to provide an alternative
basis on which to qualify, in  
part, for this sub-exception. We propose to permit actors to instead
document, on a case-by-case  
basis, the criteria used by the actor to determine when the precondition
will be satisfied, any  
criteria that were not met, and the reason why the criteria were not
met. These alternative  
conditions, which are discussed in detail below, ensure that this
sub-exception does not protect  
practices that are post hoc rationalizations used to justify improper
practices, whilst also ensuring  
that actors do not face any pressure to disclose EHI in the situation
where they do not have  
privacy policies and practices in place, or where their privacy policies
and practices do not  
respond to the requirements of this condition.

Separately, we propose that if the precondition that an actor purports
to have been  
satisfied relies on the provision of a consent or authorization from an
individual, it is a condition  
of this sub-exception that the actor must have done all things
reasonably necessary within its  
control to provide the individual with a meaningful opportunity to
provide that consent or  
authorization.  
We reiterate, again, that the information blocking provision does not
require the provision  
of access, exchange, or use of EHI in a manner that would not be
permitted under the HIPAA  
Privacy Rule.  
*Organizational policies and procedures*  
If an actor seeks to qualify for this sub-exception, in part, by
implementing and conforming  
to organizational policies and procedures, such policies and procedures
must be in writing, and  
specify the criteria to be used by the actor, and, if applicable, the
steps that the actor will take, in  
order to satisfy the precondition relied on by the actor not to provide
access, exchange, or use of  
EHI. It would not be sufficient for an actor to simply identify the
existence of the precondition in  
their organizational policies and procedures.  
We acknowledge that certain preconditions may be outside the direct
control of the actor.  
For example, the requirement that an actor receive a valid authorization
before releasing EHI in  
certain circumstances would be a precondition to be satisfied by the
individual, and the actor  
may have little ability to influence the nature of the authorization
that it receives. For  
preconditions of this nature, the actor’s policies and procedures would
only need to identify the  
criteria that the actor will apply and the steps that the actor will
take to facilitate the satisfaction  
of the precondition, such as identifying the requirements for a valid
authorization and the follow

up steps (if any) to be taken in response to receipt of an authorization
that does not meet those  
requirements. In contrast, where the satisfaction of a precondition
relies solely on an actor, such  
as the “minimum necessary” determination made by HIPAA covered entities
(or their business  
associates) when exchanging EHI that is ePHI, the actor’s policies and
procedures would need to  
particularize the steps that the actor will take in order to ensure that
it satisfies the precondition.  
Where the precondition falls somewhere in between and relies on actions
taken by both the actor  
and an individual, the actor’s policies and procedures would need to
address how the actor would  
do the things necessary within its control, which would include the
steps it should take to  
facilitate all actions needed to be taken by an individual.  
Take, for example, the situation where an actor needed to determine
whether the subject  
individual had a relationship with a requesting entity as a precondition
to exchanging EHI. The  
actor’s policies and practices should, at minimum, identify the criteria
to be applied, being the  
evidence that the actor would need in order to satisfy itself of the
existence of a relationship,  
such as receipt of a Medicare or other insurance number, or other
indicia of a relationship such as  
the establishment of a doctor-patient relationship.  
An actor would only be eligible to benefit from this sub-exception if it
has followed its  
processes and policies. Continuing the above example, an actor that
chose not to provide access  
to EHI on the basis that insufficient evidence had been provided to
establish the existence of the  
relationship, would need to show that its decision was based on the
applicable criteria specified  
in the actor’s policy and practices.  
Using a different example, and as discussed above, the HIPAA Privacy
Rule generally  
requires covered entities (and their business associates) to take
reasonable steps to limit the use

or disclosure of, and requests for, PHI to the minimum necessary to
accomplish the intended  
purpose.[117](ONCs.html#411)Satisfying the “minimum necessary”
requirement is a precondition to be met under  
the HIPAA Privacy Rule before an actor exchanges ePHI for many purposes.
The determination  
of what constitutes the “minimum necessary” is a fact based judgment
made by an actor. To  
allow covered entities the flexibility to address their unique
circumstances, the HIPAA Privacy  
Rule requires covered entities (and their business associates) to make
their own assessment of  
what ePHI is reasonably necessary for a particular purpose, given the
characteristics of their  
business and workforce. To qualify for this proposed sub-exception, the
actor’s privacy policies  
and procedures would need to identify criteria for making a “minimum
necessary” determination  
for both routine and non-routine disclosures and requests, including
identifying the  
circumstances under which disclosing the entire medical record is
reasonably necessary. For  
actors that are covered entities or business associates, the development
of policies and  
procedures for the making of minimum necessary determinations for
requesting, using and  
disclosing PHI is already a requirement of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, so we
expect that actors will  
already have such policies and procedures in place. If an actor
implemented its organizational  
policies and procedures for making “minimum necessary” determinations
consistent with the  
HIPAA Privacy Rule, and otherwise met the other conditions of this
exception, a decision to  
exchange the minimum necessary information but less information than
requested by another  
entity would satisfy this sub-exception and not be considered
information blocking.  
Finally, an actor’s policies and procedures must be implemented. This
ensures that an actor  
can only satisfy this condition by reference to privacy policies and
practices that individuals in fact

benefit from, and not by policies and procedures that have been
documented but not applied.  
Proper implementation would involve making the policies and processes
available to all decision  
makers, and facilitating workforce and contractor understanding and
consistent implementation of  
the actor’s policies and procedures such as by providing training. This
condition ensures that this  
sub-exception does not protect practices that are post hoc
rationalizations used to justify improper  
practices.  
As discussed above, to the extent existing state and federal laws apply
to a given actor,  
we expect an actor to already have procedures in place to address those
legal requirements.  
Indeed, the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that covered entities have
policies and procedures and  
training programs in place that address how PHI and ePHI are used (as
those terms are defined in  
45 CFR 160.103) and disclosed. Moreover, this exception is only
enlivened when an actor  
asserts that its conduct was carried out to satisfy a precondition, and
we expect that such conduct  
should be considered and deliberate.  
We seek comment on this proposed condition generally, and specifically,
on whether an  
actor’s organizational policies and procedures provide a sufficiently
robust and reliable basis for  
evaluating the bona fides, reasonableness, and necessity of practices
engaged in to satisfy  
preconditions required by state or federal privacy laws.  
*Documenting criteria and rationale*  
If an actor’s practice does not conform to an actor’s organizational
policies and  
procedures as required by § 171.202(b)(1), we propose that that an actor
can seek to qualify for  
this sub-exception, in part, by documenting how it reached its decision
that it would not provide  
access, use, or exchange of EHI on the basis that a precondition had not
been satisfied. Such

-----

<span id="413"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **413** of **724**  
  
documentation must be created on a case-by-case basis. An actor will not
satisfy this condition  
if, for instance, it sought to document a general practice that it had
applied to all instances where  
the precondition had not been satisfied. Rather, the record created by
the actor must address the  
specific circumstances of the specific practice (or interference) at
issue.  
The record created by the actor must identify the criteria used by the
actor to determine  
when the precondition is satisfied. That is, it must identify the
objective criteria that the actor  
applied to determine whether the precondition had been satisfied.
Consistent with the condition  
to this sub-exception that the practice must be tailored to the privacy
interest at issue (discussed  
below), those criteria would need to be directly relevant to satisfying
the precondition. For  
example, if the precondition at issue was the provision of a valid HIPAA
authorization, the  
actor’s documented record should reflect, at minimum, that the
authorization would need to meet  
each of the requirements specified for a valid authorization at 45 CFR
164.508(c). The record  
would then need to document the criteria that had not been met, and the
reason so. Continuing  
the example, the actor could record that the authorization did not
contain the name or other  
specific identification of the person making the request because the
authorization only disclosed  
the person’s first initial rather than first name, and the actor had
records about multiple people  
with that same initial and last name.  
We believe that this condition will provide the transparency necessary
to demonstrate  
whether the actor has satisfied the conditions applicable to this
exception. Moreover, it will  
ensure that a decision to not provide access, exchange, or use of EHI is
considered and  
deliberate, and therefore reasonable and necessary.  
We seek comment on this proposed condition.

*Meaningful opportunity to provide consent or authorization*  
If the precondition that an actor purports to have satisfied relies on
the provision of a  
consent or authorization from an individual, it is a condition of this
sub-exception that the actor  
must have done all things reasonably necessary within its control to
provide the individual with a  
meaningful opportunity to provide that consent or authorization. This
condition will be relevant  
when, for example, a state privacy law or the HIPAA Privacy Rule
requires an individual to  
provide their consent and/or HIPAA authorization before identifiable
information can be  
accessed, exchanged, or used for specific purposes. For instance, a
state law may require that an  
individual provide consent before a hospital can share her treatment
information electronically  
with another treating health care provider. Under this scenario, the
hospital’s refusal to exchange  
the EHI in the absence of the individual’s consent would be reasonable
and necessary and would  
not be information blocking, so long as the hospital had provided the
individual with a  
meaningful opportunity to provide that consent and where the criteria
and other conditions of this  
proposed exception were met.  
In the context of the provision of consent, a meaningful opportunity
would ordinarily  
require that an actor provide the individual with a legally compliant
consent form; make a  
reasonable effort to inform an individual that she has the right to
consent to the disclosure of her  
EHI; and provide the individual with sufficient information and
educational material  
(commensurate with the circumstances of the disclosure). It would be
best practice for an actor to  
also inform the individual about the revocability of any consent given,
if and as provided in the  
relevant state or federal privacy law, and the actor’s processes for
acting on any revocation.

We are considering addressing this condition in further detail, whether
by way of  
additional guidance or in regulation text. To this end, we seek comments
regarding what actions  
an actor should take, within the actor’s control, to provide an
individual with a meaningful  
opportunity to provide a required consent or authorization, and whether
different expectations  
should arise in the context of a consent versus a HIPAA authorization.
For example, commenters  
may wish to provide comment on the actions to be taken to ensure that an
individual has a  
meaningful opportunity to satisfy a precondition that the individual
provide a HIPAA  
authorization. Specifically, in the context of a requirement that the
authorization be signed, what  
effort should be expected from actors in seeking signatures from: (i)
persons acting for the  
patient where the patient is unable to sign a form; (ii) former patients
whose EHI is being  
requested from third parties; or (iii) patients that are not in a
facility, such as patients of  
individual physicians?  
We clarify that after providing the individual with a meaningful
opportunity to consent or  
provide authorization, we believe that it is the individual’s
responsibility to complete any  
required documentation before an actor is able to access, exchange, or
use the individual’s EHI.  
We do not expect the actor to “chase” the individual despite using its
best efforts provide the  
individual with an opportunity to sign a consent or authorization form.
So long as the actor has  
provided the individual with a meaningful opportunity to consent, the
actor will have fulfilled  
this aspect of the eligibility requirements of this sub-exception.  
Separately, to qualify for this sub-exception, to the extent that the
precondition at issue  
was the provision of a consent or authorization by an individual, the
actor must not have  
improperly encouraged or induced the individual to not provide the
consent or authorization.

This does not mean that the hospital cannot inform an individual about
the advantages and  
disadvantages of exchanging EHI and any associated risks, so long as the
information  
communicated is accurate and legitimate. However, an actor would not
meet this condition in the  
event that it misled an individual about the nature of the consent to be
provided, dissuaded  
individuals from providing consent in respect of disclosures to the
actor’s competitors, or  
imposed onerous requirements to effectuate consent that were unnecessary
and not required by  
law.  
We seek comment on whether the proposed condition requiring the
provision of a  
meaningful opportunity and prohibiting improper encouragement or
inducement should apply to  
preconditions beyond the precondition that an individual provide consent
or authorization. We  
seek comment on whether the conditions specified for this sub-exception,
when taken in total,  
are sufficiently particularized and sufficiently strict to ensure that
actors that are in a position to  
influence whether a precondition is satisfied will not be able to take
advantage of this sub-  
exception and seek protection for practices that do not promote the
privacy of EHI. We also seek  
comment on whether we should adopt a more tailored approach to
conditioning the availability  
of this exception. For example, we are considering whether different
conditions should apply  
depending on: (i) the nature of the EHI at issue; (ii) the circumstances
in which the EHI is being  
access, exchanged, or used; (iii) the interest being protected by the
precondition; or (iv) the  
nature of the precondition to be satisfied. Commenters are encouraged to
identify scenarios in  
which the application of the conditions applicable to this
sub-exception, as proposed, give rise to  
unnecessary burden, or would require activities that do not advance the

*Practice must be tailored to the specific privacy risk or interest
being addressed*  
To qualify for this sub-exception, an actor’s privacy-protective
practice must be tailored  
to the specific privacy risks that the practice actually addresses. This
condition necessarily  
presupposes that an actor has carefully evaluated the privacy
requirements imposed on the actor,  
the privacy interests to be managed by the actor, and has developed a
considered response that is  
tailored to protecting and promoting the privacy of EHI. For example,
the HIPAA Privacy Rule  
at 45 CFR 164.514(h) requires that, in certain circumstances, the
disclosure of PHI is only  
authorized once the identity and authority of the person requesting the
information has been  
verified. The privacy issue to be addressed in this instance is the risk
that PHI will be disclosed  
to the wrong individual, or an unauthorized person. If an actor chooses
not to provide access,  
exchange, or use of EHI on the basis that the actor’s identity
verification requirements have not  
been satisfied, the actor’s practice must be tailored to the specific
privacy risks at issue. This  
would require that the actor ensure that it does not impose identity
verification requirements that  
are unreasonably onerous under the circumstances.  
To illustrate, a policy where a driver’s license was the only accepted
government-issued  
form of identification would not be a practice that is tailored to the
privacy risk at issue because  
the provider’s preference for one form of government-issued
identification over another does not  
meaningfully manage the privacy risk. Similarly, it may be unreasonable
for an actor to require  
the production of documentation demonstrating the parent-child
relationship unless the actor was  
in possession of information that suggested that an adult might not have
authority to be the  
child’s legal representative. To do otherwise would be to apply an
onerous requirement in all  
instances of parent-child relationships, which is insufficiently
tailored to the privacy risk being

managed. Finally, it may be unreasonable for an actor to insist that the
individual produce  
original identification if the individual was able to furnish a scanned
copy of their form of  
identification that the actor could reasonably rely on.  
For the purposes of this sub-exception, we clarify that engaging in an
interference on the  
basis that a precondition has not been satisfied would be a practice
that addresses a privacy risk  
or interest, and so tailoring that interference to satisfy a
precondition can satisfy this condition.  
Controls on access, exchange, or use arising under privacy laws serve a
privacy interest and so  
this condition will be met so long as the actor’s practice is tailored
to the risk or interest being  
addressed.  
We seek comment on this proposed condition.  
*Practice must be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory
manner.*  
We propose that in order for a practice to qualify for this
sub-exception, the practice must  
be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner. This
condition would provide  
basic assurance that the purported privacy practice is directly related
to a specific privacy risk  
and is not being used to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI
for other purposes to  
which this exception does not apply.  
This condition requires that the actor’s privacy-protective practices
must be based on  
objective criteria that apply uniformly for all substantially similar
privacy risks. An actor could  
not, for example, implement an organizational privacy policy that
imposed unreasonably onerous  
requirements on a certain class of individuals or entities without a
legitimate justification for  
doing so. For example, an actor that offered a patient-facing software
application (app) would  
not be able to benefit from this exception if it refused to exchange EHI
with a competitor app on

requirements that applied only  
to health information exchange with the competitor app and did not apply
to, for example, the  
exchange of EHI with health care providers. This condition provides
basic assurance that the  
purported privacy-protective practice is not being used to interfere
with access, exchange, or use  
of EHI for other purposes to which this proposed exception does not

We request comment on this proposed condition.  
*Sub-exception to proposed privacy exception: Health IT developer of
certified health IT not*  
*covered by HIPAA*  
The sub-exception proposed in § 171.202(b) recognizes as reasonable and
necessary the  
activities engaged in by actors consistent with the controls placed on
access, exchange, or use of  
EHI by federal and state privacy laws. Importantly, that sub-exception
is limited to actors that  
are subject to those federal and state privacy laws; an actor that is
not regulated by HIPAA or a  
state privacy law cannot benefit from the exception proposed in §
171.202(b).  
We propose to establish a sub-exception to the information blocking
provision that would  
apply to actors that are health IT developers of certified health IT but
not regulated by the  
HIPAA Privacy Rule in respect to the operation of the actor’s health IT
product or service  
(referred to hereafter as “non-covered actors”). We expect that the
class of actors to which this  
proposed sub-exception applies will be very small. The vast majority of
health IT developers of  
certified health IT operate as business associates to health care
providers or health plans, are  
regulated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and will be able to benefit from
the exception proposed in  
§ 171.202(b) to the extent that the HIPAA Privacy Rule (or applicable
state privacy law) imposes  
preconditions to the provision of access, exchange, or use of EHI.
However, we recognize that

direct-to-consumer health IT products and services are a growing sector
of the health IT market.  
This class of health IT is often not regulated by the HIPAA Privacy
Rule, but could be certified  
under the Program. We note that the privacy practices of consumer-facing
health IT products and  
services are typically regulated by the Federal Trade Commission Act
(FTC Act). However, the  
FTC Act applies to acts and practices that are unfair and deceptive (15
U.S.C. § 45(a)(1)), and  
does not prescribe privacy requirements to be adopted or followed that
can be leveraged for the  
purpose of recognizing reasonable and necessary privacy-protective
practices in this proposed  
rule.[118](ONCs.html#420)  
As discussed in section VIII.C.2.b, where a health IT developer of
certified health IT  
offers a health IT product or service not regulated by the HIPAA Privacy
Rule, such product or  
service is subject to the information blocking provision. We want to
ensure that non-covered  
actors that engage in reasonable and necessary privacy-protective
practices that interfere with the  
access, exchange, or use of EHI can seek coverage under this proposed
sub-exception. As such,  
we propose that a non-covered actor will not engage in information
blocking if the actor does not  
provide access, exchange, or use of EHI where the practice implements a
process that is  
described in the actor’s organizational privacy policy and has been
disclosed to any individual or  
entity that uses the actor’s health IT. This proposed sub-exception is
proposed in § 171.202(c).  
As a threshold requirement of this sub-exception, the actor’s practice
of interfering with  
access, exchange, or use of EHI must comply with any applicable state or
federal privacy laws.  
While we have developed this sub-exception for the express purpose of
addressing privacy-

protective practices that are not regulated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule,
we acknowledge that  
there may be other privacy laws implicated by the practice in question.
If the actor’s practice  
contravenes a state or federal privacy law, but otherwise satisfies this
proposed sub-exception,  
the actor would not be entitled to benefit from this sub-exception.  
*Practice must implement privacy policy*  
In order to qualify for this sub-exception, the practice engaged in by
the non-covered  
actor —the interference with access, exchange, or use of EHI—must also
implement a process  
described in the actor’s organizational privacy policy. This requires
that a non-covered actor  
must have documented in detail in its organizational privacy policy the
processes and procedures  
that the actor will use to determine when the actor will not provide
access, exchange, or use of  
EHI. For example, a non-covered actor that proposed to require the
provision of written consent  
for the use or disclosure of EHI would need to describe in its
organizational privacy policy the  
processes and procedures to be utilized by the actor to implement that
privacy-protective practice  
in order that the practice be considered reasonable and necessary and
qualify for this sub-  
exception. A privacy policy that was prepared at a high level—for
example, that simply stated  
that written consent was required—would not qualify. To build on this
example, a non-covered  
actor’s consent policy would need to describe the specific requirements
that are imposed on  
individuals when giving consent, together with the processes and
procedures to be followed by  
the non-covered actor to ensure that the individual has a meaningful
choice over whether to  
consent. Compliance with this condition ensures that this sub-exception
recognizes only  
legitimate practices that have been tailored to the privacy needs of the
individuals that use the

non-covered actor’s health IT, and does not recognize practices that are
a pretext or after-the-fact  
rationalization for actions that interfere with access, exchange, or use
of EHI.  
It necessarily follows that the non-covered actor’s practice must
implement its  
documented organizational privacy policy. For example, if a non-covered
actor chose not to  
provide access, exchange, or use of EHI on the basis that it could not
verify the identity of the  
individual requesting the EHI, the non-covered actor would need to be
able to demonstrate that it  
implemented the part of its organizational privacy policy that dealt
with identity verification.  
Practices that diverge from an actor’s documented policies or practices,
or which are not  
addressed in an actor’s organizational privacy policy, would not qualify
for this proposed sub-  
exception.  
*Practice must have been disclosed to users*  
A non-covered actor that seeks to benefit from this proposed
sub-exception must also  
ensure that it has previously disclosed the privacy-protective practice
to the individuals and  
entities that use, or will use, the health IT. These users are affected
by the practices engaged in  
by a non-covered actor but may otherwise have no visibility of the
non-covered actor’s approach  
to protecting the privacy of EHI. We expect that non-covered actors will
seek to satisfy this  
condition by using a privacy notice.[119](ONCs.html#422) We emphasize
that the disclosure must be meaningful. In  
assessing whether a non-covered actor’s disclosure was meaningful,
regard will be paid to  
whether the disclosure was in plain language and conspicuous, including
whether the disclosure  
  
119 ONC has provided a Model Privacy Notice (MPN) that is a voluntary,
openly available resource designed to help  
developers clearly convey information about their privacy and security
policies to their users. Similar to the FDA  
Nutrition Facts Label, the MPN provides a snapshot of a company’s
existing privacy practices encouraging  
transparency and helping consumers make informed choices when selecting
products. The MPN does not mandate  
specific policies or substitute for more comprehensive or detailed
privacy policies.

was located in a place, and presented in a manner, that is accessible
and obvious to the  
individuals and entities that use, or will use, the health IT.  
To qualify for this sub-exception, a non-covered actor would not be
required to disclose  
its organizational privacy policy to its customers or to the public
generally. Rather, the non-  
covered actor need only describe, with sufficient detail and precision
to be readily understood by  
users of the non-covered actor’s health IT, the privacy-protective
practices that the non-covered  
actor has adopted and will observe. This is necessary because a
non-covered actor that is not  
subject to prescribed privacy standards in connection with the provision
of health IT will have  
significant flexibility in the privacy-protective practices that it
adopts. If an actor is not required  
to inform the individuals and entities that use, or will use, the health
IT, about the privacy-  
protective practices that it will implement in its product, or when
providing its service, there is a  
risk that this proposed sub-exception will give deference to policies
and processes that are post  
hoc rationalizations used to justify improper practices. This condition
also serves as a check on  
the nature of the interferences that a non-covered actor writes into its
organizational privacy  
policies; transparency will help to ensure that a non-covered actor
takes a balanced approach to  
protecting privacy interests on one hand, and pursuing business
interests that might be  
inconsistent with the information blocking provision, on the other hand.
We hope that this  
requirement will foster a quasi-market based measure of when a
privacy-protective practice is  
“reasonable and necessary,” and ensure that any departure made by a
non-covered actor from  
privacy practices that are recognized by state or federal law is
transparent and open.  
It will be a matter for non-covered actors to determine the most
appropriate way to  
communicate its privacy practices to users. We believe that it would be

We refer readers to the above discussion and invite comments on these

We seek comment on this proposed sub-exception generally. Specifically,
we seek  
comment on whether HIEs or HINs would benefit from a similar
sub-exception. We also seek  
comment on whether the conditions applicable to this sub-exception are
sufficient to ensure that  
non-covered actors cannot take advantage of this exception by engaging
in practices that are

PHI in the circumstances provided under 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1), (2), and
(3). We believe this  
exception would avoid a potential conflict between the HIPAA Privacy
Rule and the information  
blocking provision. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule contemplates
circumstances under  
which covered entities, and in some instances business associates, may
deny an individual access  
to PHI and distinguishes those grounds for denial which are reviewable
from those which are  
not. This exception applies to both the “unreviewable grounds” and
“reviewable grounds” of  
access. The “unreviewable grounds” for denial for individuals include
situations involving: (1)  
certain requests that are made by inmates of correctional institutions;
(2) information created or  
obtained during research that includes treatment, if certain conditions
are met; (3) denials  
permitted by the Privacy Act; and (4) information obtained from
non-health care providers  
pursuant to promises of confidentiality. In addition, two categories of
information are expressly  
excluded from the individual right of access: (1) psychotherapy notes,
which are the personal  
notes of a mental health care provider documenting or analyzing the
contents of a counseling  
session that are maintained separate from the rest of the patient’s
medical record (*see* 45 CFR  
164.524(a)(1)); and (2) information compiled in reasonable anticipation
of, or for use in, a civil,  
criminal, or administrative action or proceeding (*see* 45 CFR
164.501).

a covered entity may deny access provided that the individual is given a
right to have such  
denials reviewed under certain circumstances. One such circumstance is
when a licensed health  
care professional, in the exercise of professional judgment, determines
that the access requested  
is reasonably likely to endanger the life or physical safety of the
individual or another person. In  
addition, if access is denied, then the individual has the right to have

licensed health professional who is to act as a reviewing official and
did not participate in the  
original decision to deny access ** (*see generally* 45 CFR
164.524(a)(3)).  
  
We propose that if an actor who is a covered entity or business
associate denies an  
individual’s request for access to their PHI on the basis of these
unreviewable and reviewable  
grounds, and provided the denial of access complies with the
requirements of the HIPAA  
Privacy Rule in each case, then the actor would qualify for this
exception and these practices  
would not constitute information blocking.  
  
The following example illustrates this proposed sub-exception. An
individual is a patient  
of a psychiatrist who is a HIPAA covered entity. The patient has
requested all of his electronic  
health files from the psychiatrist. The psychiatrist maintains
separately from the electronic health  
record a file containing psychotherapy notes regarding the patient. The
psychiatrist grants access  
to the patient by providing a copy of the information in his electronic
health record, but does not  
provide the patient’s psychotherapy notes. Under this example, the
psychiatrist would meet the  
requirements of this proposed exception since the HIPAA Privacy Rule
provides that covered  
entities can deny individuals access to their psychotherapy notes and
provides that this is an  
unreviewable grounds for denial.  
We seek comment on this proposed sub-exception.  
*Sub-exception to proposed privacy exception: Respecting an individual’s
request not to share*  
*information.*  
  
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking
provision that would, in

or use of EHI if an  
individual has specifically requested that the actor not do so. This
sub-exception is proposed in §

171.202(e). We believe this sub-exception is necessary to ensure that
actors are confident that  
they can respect individuals’ privacy choices without engaging in
information blocking, and to  
promote public confidence in the health IT infrastructure by
effectuating patients’ preference  
about how and under what circumstances their EHI will be accessed,
exchanged, and used. We  
recognize that individuals may have concerns about permitting their EHI
to be accessed,  
exchanged, or used electronically under certain circumstances. As a
matter of public policy, we  
think that these privacy concerns, if expressed by an individual and
agreed to by an actor, would  
be reasonable and necessary, and an actor’s conduct in abiding by its
agreement would, if all  
conditions are met, be an exception to the information blocking
provision.  
This proposed sub-exception would not apply under circumstances where an
actor  
interferes with a use or disclosure of EHI that is required by law,
including when EHI is required  
by the Secretary to enforce HIPAA under 45 CFR 164.502(a)(2)(ii) and 45
CFR  
164.502(a)(4)(i). Stated differently, this sub-exception would not
operate to permit an actor to  
refuse to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI when that access,
exchange, or use is required  
by law. This sub-exception recognizes and supports the public policy
objective of the HIPAA  
Privacy Rule, which identifies uses and disclosures of EHI for which the
public interest in the  
disclosure of the individual’s information outweighs the individual’s
interests in controlling the  
information.  
This sub-exception would permit an actor not to share EHI if the
following conditions are  
met: (1) the individual made the request to the actor not to have his or
her EHI accessed,  
exchanged, or used; (2) the individual’s request was initiated by the
individual without any

improper encouragement or inducement by the actor; and (3) the actor or
its agent documents the  
request within a reasonable time period.  
  
To qualify for this sub-exception, the request that the individual’s EHI
not be accessed,  
exchanged, or used must come from the individual. Moreover, the
individual must have made the  
request independently and without any improper encouragement or
inducement by the actor. For  
example, it would be improper to encourage individuals not to share
information with  
unaffiliated providers on the basis of generalized or speculative risks
of unauthorized disclosure.  
On the other hand, if the actor was aware of a specific privacy or
security risk, it would not be  
improper to inform individuals of that risk. Likewise, an actor would be
permitted to provide an  
individual with general information about her privacy rights and
options, including for example,  
the option to not provide consent, provided the information is presented
accurately, does not omit  
important information, and is not presented in a way that is likely to
improperly influence the  
individual’s decision about how to exercise their rights.  
  
If an individual submits a request to an actor not to disclose her EHI,
and the actor agrees  
with and documents the request, the request would be valid for purposes
of this sub-exception  
unless and until it is subsequently revoked by the individual. We
believe this approach would  
minimize compliance burdens for actors while also respecting
individuals’ requests. We propose  
that once the individual makes the request, she should not, subject to
the requirements of  
applicable federal or state laws and regulations, have to continually
reiterate her privacy  
preferences, such as having to re-submit a request every year. Likewise,
we propose that once the  
actor has documented an individual’s request, the actor should not have
to repeatedly reconfirm  
and re-document the request. We seek comment, however, regarding whether
this approach is

too permissive and could result in unintended consequences. We also seek
comment on this  
proposed sub-exception generally, including on effective ways for an
individual to revoke his or  
her privacy request for purposes of this sub-exception.  
We also propose that in order for a practice to qualify for this
sub-exception, an actor’s  
practice must be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory
manner. This condition  
would provide basic assurance that the purported privacy practice is
directly related to the risk of  
disclosing EHI contrary to the wishes of an individual, and is not being
used to interfere with  
access, exchange, or use of EHI for other purposes to which this
exception does not apply. This  
condition requires that the actor’s privacy-protective practice must be
based on objective criteria  
that apply uniformly for all substantially similar privacy risks.  
We note that under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, individuals have the right to
request  
restrictions on how a covered entity will use (as that term is defined
in 45 CFR160.103) and  
disclose PHI about them for treatment, payment, and health care
operations pursuant to 45 CFR  
164.522(a)(1). Under § 164.522(a), a covered entity is not required to
agree to an individual’s  
request for a restriction (other than in the case of a disclosure to a
health plan under §  
164.522(a)(1)(vi)), but is bound by any restrictions to which it
agrees.  
We wish to clarify that, for the purposes of this proposed
sub-exception, the actor may  
give effect to an individual’s request not to have an actor disclose EHI
even if state or federal  
laws would allow the actor not to follow the individual’s request. This
is consistent with our  
position that, absent improper encouragement or inducement, and subject
to appropriate  
conditions, it should not be considered information blocking to give
effect to patients’ individual  
preferences about how their EHI will be shared or not. As an
illustration, if an individual

requests that her EHI not be accessed, exchanged, or used by a physician
to help train new staff  
at a hospital, the physician may agree not to use the individual’s EHI
for this purpose despite the  
fact it would not be required by law to agree to such a restriction.
Provided the physician has not  
encouraged or induced the individual to make this request, this
sub-exception would apply to the  
physician’s refusal to disclose the information to staff for training
purposes.  
We seek comments on this sub-exception generally. Specifically, we seek
comment on  
what would be considered a reasonable time frame for documentation. In
addition, we also seek  
comment on how this sub-exception would affect public health disclosures
and health care  
research, if an actor did not share a patient’s EHI due to a privacy
preference, including any  
effects on preventing or controlling diseases, injury, or disability,
and the reporting of disease,  
injury, and vital events such as births or deaths, and the conduct of
public health surveillance and  
health care research.  
3\. Promoting the Security of EHI  
  
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking
provision that would  
permit actors to engage in practices that are reasonable and necessary
to promote the security of  
EHI, subject to certain conditions. Without this exception, actors may
be reluctant to implement  
security measures or engage in other activities that are reasonable and
necessary for safeguarding  
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EHI. This could
undermine the ultimate goals of  
the information blocking provision by discouraging best practice
security protocols and  
diminishing the reliability of the health IT ecosystem.  
  
Robust security protections are critical to promoting patients’ and
other stakeholders’  
trust and confidence that EHI will be collected, used, and shared in a
manner that protects

individuals’ privacy and complies with applicable legal requirements.
Public confidence in the  
security of their EHI has been challenged, however, by the growing
incidence of cyber-attacks in  
the health care sector. More than ever, health care providers, health IT
developers, HIEs and  
HINs must be vigilant to mitigate security risks and implement
appropriate safeguards to secure  
the EHI they collect, maintain, access, use, and exchange.  
  
The Cures Act directs the National Coordinator, in consultation with the
HHS Office for  
Civil Rights (OCR), to issue guidance on common “security barriers” that
prevent the trusted  
exchange of EHI (section 3022(c)(2) of the PHSA). However, the Cures Act
also seeks to  
promote the security of EHI, which it defines as an element of
interoperability (section  
3000(9)(A) of the PHSA) and a target area for the policy development to
be undertaken by the  
Health Information Technology Advisory Committee (section
3002(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the PHSA).  
The inclusion of these provisions promote broader access, exchange, and
use of EHI while at the  
same time continuing to promote the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of EHI through  
security practices that are appropriate and tailored to identified
vulnerabilities and risks.  
To qualify for this exception, we propose that an actor’s conduct must
satisfy threshold  
conditions. As discussed in detail below, the particular
security-related practice must be directly  
related to safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of EHI, implemented  
consistently and in a non-discriminatory manner, and tailored to
identified security risks.  
While the importance of security practices cannot be overstated, this
proposed exception  
would not apply to *all* practices that purport to secure EHI. Rather,
this exception will only be  
available when the actor’s security-based practice satisfies the
conditions applicable to this  
exception. We do not believe it would be appropriate to prescribe a
“maximum” level of security

or to dictate a one-size-fits-all approach for all actors that may not
be appropriate in all  
circumstances and may not accommodate new threats, countermeasures, and
best practices in a  
rapidly changing security landscape. Indeed, security infrastructure
varies from organization to  
organization, and there exist diverse approaches and technology
solutions to managing security  
risks. We do not intend for this proposed exception to dictate a
specific security approach when  
an actor’s security posture must be agile and its practices iterative.
Moreover, effective security  
best practices focus on the mitigation and remediation of risks to a
reasonable and acceptable  
level, and not the elimination of all vulnerabilities, so organizations
should have the flexibility to  
assess what vulnerabilities to address and how best to address them
while ensuring the  
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EHI.  
As such, we propose that actors would be able to satisfy this exception
through practices  
that implement either security policies and practices developed by the
actor, or case-by-case  
determinations made by the actor. Whether a security-motivated practice
meets this exception  
would be determined on a case-by-case basis using a fact-based analysis
of the conditions set  
forth below. This approach offers the most appropriate framework for
analyzing security  
practices, which are necessarily driven by and must be tailored to
actors’ individual  
circumstances.  
We wish to emphasize that the security-based practices implemented by a
single  
physician office with limited technology resources, for example, will be
different to those  
implemented by a large health system, and that this difference does not
affect an actor’s ability to  
qualify for this exception. The fact-based approach we propose will
allow each actor to

implement policies, procedures, and technologies that are appropriate
for its particular size,  
organizational structure, and risks to individuals’ EHI.  
  
A fact-based analysis also aligns with the HIPAA Security
Rule[120](ONCs.html#433) concerning the  
security of ePHI. The HIPAA Security Rule does not dictate the security
measures that a covered  
entity or business associate must implement, but instead requires the
entity to develop security  
practices and implement administrative, physical, and technical
safeguards that take into account  
the entity’s size, complexity, and capabilities; technical, hardware,
and software infrastructure;  
the costs of security measures; and the likelihood and possible impact
of potential risks to ePHI.  
Under the HIPAA Security Rule, covered entities and business associates
are required to conduct  
an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and
vulnerabilities to the  
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI held by the covered
entity or business  
associate. Once covered entities and business associates have completed
the risk assessment,  
they must take security measures sufficient to reduce identified risks
and vulnerabilities to  
reasonable and appropriate levels (45 CFR 164.308(a)(1)(ii)). We note,
however, that while our  
approach is consistent with the regulation of security practices under
the HIPAA Security Rule,  
the fact that a practice complies with the HIPAA Security Rule does not
establish that it meets  
the conditions of this proposed exception to the information blocking
provision. The HIPAA  
Security Rule and this proposed exception have different focuses. The
HIPAA Security Rule  
establishes a baseline by requiring certain entities to ensure the
confidentiality, integrity, and  
availability of ePHI by implementing security measures, among other
safeguards, that the entities  
determine are sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a
reasonable and appropriate level.  
  
120 The HIPAA Security Rule is located at 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A
and C of Part 164 and 68 FR 8333.

In contrast, the purpose of this exception to the information blocking
provision is to provide  
flexibility for reasonable and necessary security practices while
screening out practices that  
purport to promote the security of EHI but that are unreasonably broad,
onerous on those seeking  
access to the EHI, are not applied consistently across/within an
organization, or otherwise may  
unreasonably interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI.  
We propose the following conditions that must be met for an activity or
practice to  
qualify for this exception.  
*The practice must be directly related to safeguarding the
confidentiality, integrity, and*  
*availability of EHI.*  
  
As a threshold condition, the proposed exception would not apply to any
practices that  
are not directly related to safeguarding the security of EHI. In
assessing the practice, we would  
consider whether and to what extent the practice directly addressed
specific security risks or  
concerns. We would also consider whether the practice served any other
purposes and, if so,  
whether those purposes were merely incidental to the overriding security
purpose or provided an  
objectively distinct, non-security-related rationale for engaging in the
practice.  
  
We note that it should not be particularly difficult or onerous for an
actor to demonstrate,  
as contemplated above, that its practice was directly related to a
specific security risk or concern.  
For example, the actor may show that the practice was a direct response
to a known security  
incident or threat; or that the practice directly related to the need to
verify a person’s identity  
before granting access to EHI; or that the practice was directly related
to ensuring the integrity of  
EHI.

The salient issue under this condition, therefore, would be whether the
security practice  
was actually necessary and directly related to safeguarding EHI. To that
end, we would consider  
the actor’s purported basis for adopting the particular security
practice, which could be  
evidenced by the actor’s organizational security policy, risk
assessments, and other relevant  
documentation, which most actors are already required to develop
pursuant to requirements  
under the HIPAA Rules.[121](ONCs.html#435) However, we propose that the
documentation of an actor’s decision-  
making would not necessarily be dispositive. For example, if the
practice had the practical effect  
of disadvantaging competitors or steering referrals, this could be
evidence that the practice was  
not directly related to the safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of EHI. We  
propose that such an inference would also not be warranted where the
actor has not met the other  
conditions of this exception proposed below, as where the actor’s
policies were not developed or  
implemented in a reasonable manner; its security policies or practices
were not tailored to  
specific risks; or it applied its security policies or practices in an
inconsistent or discriminatory  
manner.  
*The practice must be tailored to the specific security risk being
addressed.*  
  
To qualify for this exception, we propose that an actor’s
security-related practice must be  
tailored to specific security risks that the practice actually
addressed. This condition necessarily  
presupposes that an actor has carefully evaluated the risk posed by the
security threat and  
developed a considered response that is tailored to mitigating the
vulnerabilities of the actor’s  
health IT or other related systems. For example, the awareness of a
security vulnerability in a  
particular HIE’s technology may justify a health care provider’s
suspending access to EHI from  
  
121 45 CFR 164.306(d)(3)(ii)(B)(1); 45 CFR 164.316(b)(1).

that organization or by participants of that HIE, but only for the
period in which the threat  
persists. In contrast, a response that suspended access by all HIEs or
that persisted even after the  
HIE had addressed the security vulnerability in its technology would not
be tailored to address  
specific risks and would not meet this condition.  
  
As another example, it may be reasonable for a health care provider to
refuse to grant  
access to EHI when an individual has been unable to prove her identity.
However, the actor’s  
identity proofing practice would have to be tailored to address risks
specifically associated with  
the disclosure of EHI to unauthorized individuals. For example, identity
proofing requirements  
might be tailored if the practice is based on a risk assessment and best
practice policies and  
procedures and is applied consistently and in a non-discriminatory
manner. However, we believe  
an identity proofing requirement would not be tailored if it were not
based on an objectively  
reasonable security risk assessment and a careful consideration of
alternative approaches that  
could adequately address the specific risk of patient misidentification
in a less restrictive fashion.  
  
As a final example, an actor’s decision to deny access to the EHI it
maintains may be  
reasonable if the practice responds to a request for EHI from a
patient-facing website or  
application that causes the actor's system to raise a malicious software
detection alert or if the  
request comes from a website or application listed on a security
“blacklist.” However, we  
propose that the actor’s response must be tailored to the specific
threat. Among other things, the  
denial of access must be limited to the patient and/or their personal
software. So as to ensure that  
the response is properly tailored, it would be best practice for actors
to ensure that they  
communicate to those persons whose access was denied the reason for the
denial of access, and  
communicate objective timeframes (if feasible to do so) and other
parameters for when access

would be granted or restored. Moreover, we propose that, to the extent
that the practice  
implements an organizational security policy, the policy must align with
applicable consensus-  
based standards or best practices for responding to these types of
incidents. Disagreement with  
the individual about the worthiness of the third party as a recipient of
EHI, or even concerns  
about what the third party might do with the EHI, except for reasons
such as those listed in the  
“preventing harm” exception, are not acceptable reasons to deny an
individual’s request.  
*Practice must be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory
manner.*  
  
We propose that in order for a practice to qualify for this proposed
exception, the actor’s  
practice must have been implemented in a consistent and
non-discriminatory manner. This  
condition would provide basic assurance that the purported security
practice is directly related to  
a specific security risk and is not being used to interfere with access,
exchange, or use of EHI for  
other purposes to which this exception does not apply.  
  
As an illustration solely of the non-discriminatory manner condition,
consider a health IT  
developer of certified health IT that offers apps to its customers via
an app marketplace. If the  
developer requires that third-party apps sold (or made available) via
the developer’s app  
marketplace meet certain security requirements, those security
requirements must be imposed in  
a non-discriminatory manner. This would mean, for example, that if a
developer imposed a  
requirement that third-party apps include two-factor authentication for
patient access, the  
developer would need to ensure that the same requirement was imposed on,
and met by, all other  
apps, including any apps made available by the developer itself. To
note, such a developer  
requirement must also meet the other conditions of this exception (e.g.,
the condition that the  
practice ** be tailored to the specific security risk being
addressed).

*Practices that implement an organizational security policy.*  
  
As discussed above, an actor’s approach to information security
management will reflect  
the actor’s particular size, organizational structure, and risk posture.
Because of this, it is  
important that actors develop and implement organizational policies that
secure EHI. We  
propose that, where an actor has documented security policies that align
with applicable  
consensus-based standards, and where the policies are implemented in a
consistent and non-  
discriminatory manner, a practice’s conformity with such policies would
provide a degree of  
assurance that the practice was reasonable and necessary to address
specific security risks and  
thus should not constitute information blocking. Conversely, a practice
that went beyond an  
actor’s established policies or practices by imposing security controls
that were not documented,  
would not qualify for this exception under this condition (although the
actor may be able to  
qualify under the alternative basis for practices that do not implement
a security policy). Further,  
such practices would be suspect under the information blocking provision
if there were  
indications that the actor’s security-related justifications were a
pretext or after-the-fact  
rationalizations for its actions or was otherwise unreasonable under the
circumstances.  
We reiterate that, to the extent that an actor seeks to justify a
practice on the basis of its  
organizational security policies, such policies must be in writing and
implemented in a consistent  
and non-discriminatory manner. As noted above, what a policy requires
will depend on the facts  
and circumstances. However, we propose that to support a presumption
that a practice conducted  
pursuant to the actor’s security policy was reasonable, the policy would
have to meet the  
following conditions.

• *Risks identified and assessed*. ** The actor’s security policy must
be informed by an assessment  
of the security risks facing the actor. While we do not propose any
requirements as to a risk  
assessment, we note that a good risk assessment would use an approach
consistent with  
industry standards,[122](ONCs.html#439) and would incorporate elements
such as threat and vulnerability  
analysis, data collection, security measures, likelihood of occurrence,
impact, level of risk,  
and final reporting.[123](ONCs.html#439)  
• *Consensus-based standards or best practice guidance*. The actor’s
policy must align with  
one or more applicable consensus-based standards or best practice
guidance. At present,  
examples of relevant best practices for development of security policies
include, but are not  
limited to: NIST-800-53 Rev. 5; the NIST Cybersecurity Framework; and
NIST SP 800-100,  
SP 800-37 Rev. 2, SP 800-39, as updated and as interpreted through
formal guidance. Best  
practice guidance on security policies is also developed by consensus
standards bodies such  
as ISO, IETF, or IEC. HIPAA covered entities and business associates may
be able to  
leverage their HIPAA Security Rule compliance activities and can, if
they choose, align their  
security policy with those parts of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
that are referenced in  
the HIPAA Security Rule Crosswalk to NIST Cybersecurity Framework to
satisfy this  
condition. Relevant consensus-based standards and frameworks provide
actors of varying  
size and resources with the flexibility needed to apply the right
security controls to the right  
information systems at the right time to adequately address risk.

provide objective timeframes and common terminology used for
identifying, responding to,  
and addressing security incidents. Examples of acceptable sources for
development of a  
security response plan include: NIST Incident Response

As a point of clarification, we note that an actor’s compliance with the
HIPAA Security  
Rule (if applicable to the actor) would be relevant to, but not
dispositive of, whether the actor’s  
policies and procedures were objectively reasonable for the purpose of
this exception. An actor’s  
documentation of its security policies and procedures for compliance
with the Security Rule may  
not offer a basis to evaluate whether the actor’s security practices
unnecessarily interfere with  
access, use, or exchange of EHI. For example, it could be difficult to
determine whether a  
practice unnecessary interferes with exchange of EHI based on a review
of the customized PHI  
data flow diagram the actor prepared as part of its Security Rule risk
analysis. We believe that a  
documented policy that provides explicit references to consensus-based
standards and best  
practice guidance (such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework) offer an
objective and robust  
means for ONC and the OIG to evaluate the reasonableness of a particular
security control for  
the purpose of this exception.  
We recognize that, as a practical matter, some actors (such as small
health care providers  
or those with limited resources) may have organizational security
policies that are less robust or  
that otherwise fall short of the minimum conditions proposed above. As

circumstances, without regard to a formal policy.  
*Practices that do not implement an organizational security policy.*  
  
While we expect that most security practices engaged in by an actor will
implement an  
organizational policy, we recognize that EHI security may present novel
and unexpected threats  
that even a best-practice risk assessment and security policy cannot
anticipate. If a practice that  
does not implement an organizational policy is to qualify for this
exception, however, it must  
meet certain conditions. The actor’s practice must, based on the
particularized facts and  
circumstances, be necessary to mitigate the security risk. Importantly,
we propose that the actor  
would have to demonstrate that it considered reasonable and appropriate
alternatives that could  
have reduced the likelihood of interference with access, exchange, or
use of EHI, and that there  
were no reasonable and appropriate alternatives that were less likely to
interfere with access,  
exchange or use of EHI.  
  
We note that an actor’s consideration of reasonable and appropriate
alternatives will  
depend on the urgency and nature of the security threat in question. We
anticipate that an actor’s  
qualification for this exception would accommodate exigent
circumstances. For example, we  
would not expect an actor to delay the implementation of a security
measure in response to an  
emergency on the basis that it has not yet been able to initiate a fully
realized risk assessment  
process. However, we expect that in these exigent circumstances, where
the actor has  
implemented a security practice without first considering whether there
were reasonable and  
appropriate alternatives that were less likely to interfere with access,
exchange or use of EHI, the

actor would expeditiously make any necessary changes to the practice
based on the actor’s  
consideration of reasonable and appropriate alternatives that are less
likely to interfere with  
access, exchange or use of EHI. We propose that the exception would
apply in these instances so  
long as an actor takes these steps and complies with all other
applicable conditions.  
We encourage comment on these conditions and our overall approach to
this proposed  
exception, including whether our proposal provides adequate flexibility
for actors to implement  
measures that are commensurate to the threats they face, the technology
infrastructure they  
possess, and their overall security profiles and, equally important,
whether this exception  
adequately mitigates the risk that actors will adopt security policies
that are unnecessarily  
restrictive or engage in practices that unreasonably interfere with
access, exchange, or use of  
EHI. Commenters are encouraged to propose additional conditions that may
be necessary to  
ensure that the exception is tailored and does not extend protection to
practices that are not  
reasonable and necessary to promote the security of EHI and that could
present information  
blocking concerns. We also seek comment on whether the use of
consensus-based standards and  
guidance provides an appropriate reference point for the development of
security policies.  
Finally, commenters may wish to offer an alternative basis for
identifying practices that do not  
offer a security benefit (compared with available alternatives) but that
cause an information  
blocking harm by interfering with access, exchange, or use of EHI.  
4\. Recovering Costs Reasonably Incurred  
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking
provision that would  
permit the recovery of certain costs reasonably incurred to provide
access, exchange, or use of  
EHI. The exception and corresponding conditions are set forth in the
proposed regulation text in

§ 171.204. We interpret the definition of information blocking to
include *any* fee that is likely to  
interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI (see discussion in
section VIII.C.4.c.iv). We  
anticipate that this interpretation may be broader than necessary to
address genuine information  
blocking concerns and could have unintended consequences on innovation
and competition.  
Specifically, unless we establish an exception, actors may be unable to
recover costs that they  
reasonably incur to develop technologies and provide services that
enhance interoperability. This  
could undermine the ultimate goals of the information blocking provision
by diminishing  
incentives to invest in, develop, and disseminate interoperable
technologies and services that  
enable more robust access, exchange, and use of EHI. Therefore, we
propose to establish an  
exception that would permit the recovery of certain costs that we
believe are unlikely to present  
information blocking concerns and would generally promote innovation,
competition, and  
consumer welfare, provided certain conditions are met. We note that
complying with the  
requirements of this exception would not prevent an actor from making a
profit in connection  
with the provision of access, exchange, or use of EHI. Indeed, the costs
recoverable under this  
proposed exception could include a reasonable profit, provided that all
applicable conditions  
were met.  
  
The exception would be subject to strict conditions to prevent its
potential misuse.  
Specifically, we are concerned that a broad or insufficiently tailored
exception for the recovery  
of costs could protect rent-seeking, opportunistic fees, and
exclusionary practices that interfere  
with the access, exchange, and use of EHI. These practices fall within
the definition of  
information blocking and reflect some of the most serious concerns that
motivated its enactment  
(*see* section VIII.B of this preamble). For example, in the Information
Blocking Congressional

Report, we cited evidence of wide variation in fees charged for health
IT products and services.  
While we cautioned that the issue of fees is nuanced, and that
variations in fees could be  
attributable in part to different technology architectures, service
models, capabilities, service  
levels, and other factors, we concluded that these factors alone could
not adequately explain all  
of the variation in prices that we had observed. Based on these and
other indications, we  
concluded that some actors were engaging in opportunistic pricing
practices or, in some cases,  
charging prices designed to deter connectivity or exchange with
competing technologies or  
services.  
  
In the time since we published the Information Blocking Congressional
Report, these  
practices have persisted and, in certain respects, become more
pronounced. In a national survey  
of HIE executives published in 2017, 47% of respondents reported that
EHR developers  
“often/routinely” charge high fees for exchange that are unrelated to
cost, and another 40%  
reported that they “sometimes” do.[124](ONCs.html#444)Meanwhile, we have
continued to receive credible  
evidence of rent-seeking and other opportunistic behaviors, such as fees
for data export and data  
portability that are not plausibly related to any reasonable time,
materials, or other costs that a  
developer would reasonably incur to provide these services. And, while
some practices described  
in the Information Blocking Congressional Report have become less
prevalent (such as the  
charging of per-transaction fees), other practices have emerged that are
equally concerning.  
  
As just one illustration, some EHR developers have begun conditioning
access or use of  
customer EHI on revenue-sharing or royalty agreements that bear no
plausible relation to the

costs incurred by the EHR developer to grant access to the EHI. We have
also heard of  
discriminatory pricing policies that have the obvious purpose and effect
of excluding competitors  
from the use of interoperability elements. Many of the industry
stakeholders who shared their  
perspectives with us in listening sessions prior to this proposed rule,
including several health IT  
developers of certified health IT, condemned these practices and urged
us to swiftly address  
them.  
  
In light of these concerns, we propose that this exception would apply
only to the  
recovery of certain costs and only when the actor’s methods for
recovering such costs comply  
with certain conditions at all relevant times. As discussed in more
detail below, these conditions  
would require that the costs the actor recovered were reasonably
incurred and did not reflect  
costs that are speculative or subjective. Actors would also be required
to allocate costs in an  
appropriate manner and to use objective and permissible criteria when
charging fees to recover  
those costs. Further, the exception would not apply to certain fees,
such as those based on the  
profit or revenue associated with the use of EHI (either being earned by
the actor, or that could  
be realized by another individual or entity) that exceed the actor’s
reasonable costs for providing  
access, exchange, or use of the EHI. We specify certain prohibited fees
below.  
Finally, the exception would provide additional conditions applicable to
fees charged in  
connection with: (1) the certified APIs described in § 170.404; and (2)
the EHI export capability  
proposed in § 170.315(b)(10) for the purposes of switching health IT or
to provide patients their  
electronic health information. We emphasize that access to EHI that is
provisioned by supplying  
some form of physical media, such as paper copies (where the EHI is
printed out), or where EHI  
is copied onto a CD or flash-drive, would not be a practice that
implicated the information

blocking provision provided that the fee(s) charged for that access
complied with HIPAA (45  
CFR 164.524(c)(4)).  
  
Our intention with this exception is not to set any particular cost that
would be considered  
“reasonably incurred,” but rather to allow the market to define the
appropriate price so long as  
certain methods are followed and certain criteria are met.  
*Requirement that costs be reasonably incurred.*  
Regardless of the type of cost at issue, a basic condition of this
proposed exception is that  
any costs the actor seeks to recover must have been reasonably incurred
to provide the relevant  
interoperability elements to enable access, exchange, or use of EHI.
Ultimately, whether a cost  
was reasonably incurred will depend on the particular facts and
circumstances. We believe this  
fact-based approach is appropriate in light of the considerable
diversity in the types of costs that  
actors might incur and the range of factors that could bear on the
reasonableness of those costs.  
For example, the costs of developing software may vary with the purposes
it is intended to serve,  
the settings in which it will be deployed, the types and scope of
capabilities included, and the  
extent to which these development efforts build on existing development
efforts and know-how.  
Additionally, the costs of providing services, including the
implementation of technology in  
production environments, may vary based on the technology design or
architecture, individual  
customer needs, local implementation conditions, and other factors. An
analysis of costs would  
also account for different distribution and service models under which
the costs are calculated.  
We seek comment on these and other considerations that may be relevant
to assessing the  
reasonableness of costs incurred for purposes of this exception.

To qualify for the exception, we propose that the method by which the
actor seeks to  
recover its costs must be reasonable and non-discriminatory. This would
require that the actor  
base its recovery of costs on objective and verifiable criteria that are
uniformly applied for all  
substantially similar or similarly situated classes of persons and
requests. We emphasize that this  
proposal does not mean that the actor must apply the same prices or
price terms for all persons or  
classes of persons to whom it provides the services. However, any
differences in prices or price  
terms would have to be based on actual differences in the costs that the
actor incurred or other  
reasonable and non-discriminatory criteria. We further propose to
require that the method by  
which the actor recovers its costs must be reasonably related to the
actor’s costs of providing the  
type of access, exchange, or use to, or at the request of, the person or
entity to whom the fee is  
charged.  
  
We also propose that the method by which the actor recovers its costs
must be reasonably  
allocated among all customers to whom the technology or service is
supplied, or for whom the  
technology is supported. A reasonable allocation of costs would require
that the actor allocate its  
costs in accordance with criteria that are reasonable and between only
those customers that either  
cause the costs to be incurred or benefit from the associated supply or
support of the technology.  
If an actor developed technology that could be supplied to multiple
customers with minimal  
tailoring, the core costs of developing its technology should be
allocated between those  
customers when recovered as a fee. The actor would not be permitted to
recover the total of its  
core costs from each customer. Similarly, when an actor uses shared
facilities and resources to  
support the usage of technology, it would need to ensure that those
shared costs were reasonably  
allocated between all of the customers that benefited from them.
However, whenever an actor is

required to provide services and incur costs that are unique to a
particular customer, it would not  
need to distribute those costs among other customers that had deployed
technology.  
In addition, the exception would not apply if the method by which the
actor recovers its  
costs is based, in any part, on whether the requestor or other person is
a competitor, potential  
competitor, or will be using the EHI in a way that facilitates
competition with the actor. The use  
of such criteria would be suspect because it suggests the fee the actor
is charging is not based on  
its reasonable costs to provide the services and may have the purpose or
effect of excluding or  
creating impediments for competitors, business rivals, or other persons
engaged in developing or  
enabling the use of interoperable technologies and services.  
Last, we propose that the method by which the actor recovers its costs
must not be based  
on the sales, profit, revenue, or other value that the requestor or
other persons derive or may  
derive from the access to, exchange of, or use of electronic health
information, including the  
secondary use of such information, that *exceeds* the actor’s reasonable
costs for providing access,  
exchange, or use of electronic health information. We emphasize that
such revenue-sharing or  
profit-sharing arrangements would *only* be acceptable and covered by
the exception if such  
arrangements are designed to provide an alternative way to recover the
costs reasonably incurred  
for providing services.  
  
We seek comment on these conditions and other issues we should consider
in assessing  
whether the methodology by which an actor distributes costs and charges
fees should be  
considered reasonable and necessary for purposes of this exception. In
particular we are  
considering whether to introduce specific factors and methods for
assessing when profit will be  
reasonable. For example, should the pro-competitive or efficiency-adding
aspect of an actor’s

approach to providing access, exchange, or use of EHI be taken into
account when assessing the  
reasonableness of the profit recovered by an actor? We also ask
commenters to consider whether  
there are specific use cases for which actors’ profits should be limited
or prohibited. We request  
that commenters provide as much detail as possible when describing
methods for quantifying  
profits and evaluating their reasonableness.  
*Costs Specifically Excluded*  
We propose that certain costs should be explicitly excluded from this
exception  
regardless of the method for recovering the costs. We have proposed
these excluded costs, which  
are detailed below, in an effort to provide additional clarity about the
scope of this exception and  
to create guardrails for preventing potential misuse of the exception.  
*Costs Due to Non-standard Design or Implementation Choices*  
We propose that this exception would not permit the recovery of any cost
that the actor  
incurred due to the health IT being designed or implemented in
non-standard ways that  
unnecessarily increase the complexity, difficulty or burden of
accessing, exchanging, or using  
EHI. To the extent that such costs can be reasonably avoided, we believe
that actors should  
internalize the costs of such behaviors, which do not benefit consumers,
and which create  
unnecessary impediments to access, exchange, and use of EHI. As an
illustration, if a health IT  
developer of certified health IT designed its database tables or other
aspects of its technology in  
ways that make exporting or converting EHI to other formats difficult,
the developer could not  
claim that its costs to provide data conversion services to customers
are reasonably incurred.  
Such costs would not be eligible under this exception (and might
implicate the information  
blocking provision for the reasons noted in section VIII.C.4.c.v of this
preamble).

<span id="450"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **450** of **724**  
  
We welcome comments on the exclusion of these types of costs.  
  
*Subjective or Speculative Costs*  
We propose to limit this exception to the recovery of costs that an
actor *actually* incurred  
to provide the relevant interoperability element or group of elements
(which may comprise either  
products or services). We propose that this exception would not permit
the recovery of certain  
types of costs that are subjective or speculative. We note two important
examples of this  
limitation.  
First, an actor would not be permitted to recover any costs associated
with intangible  
assets (including depreciation or loss of value), other than the actual
development or acquisition  
costs of such assets. For example, an actor could not charge a customer
a fee based on the  
purported “cost” of allowing the customer to use the actor’s patented
technology, computer  
software, databases, trade secrets, copyrighted works, and the like. We
understand that the  
customer’s use of the asset could be considered a “cost” in the sense
that, were it not for the  
information blocking provision, the actor could charge a royalty or
other fee for the use of its  
intangible assets. For this reason, in section VIII.D.6, we propose to
permit an actor to license  
most interoperability elements on reasonable and non-discriminatory
terms, subject to certain  
conditions. For purposes of this more general exception, however, we
believe it would be  
inappropriate to permit an actor to charge a fee based on these
considerations, which are  
inherently subjective and could invite the kinds of rent-seeking and
opportunistic pricing  
practices that fall squarely within the definition of information
blocking. We clarify that an  
actor’s practices could qualify for both this exception (recovering
costs reasonably incurred) and

the exception for licensing of interoperability elements on reasonable
and non-discriminatory  
terms in section VIII.D.6. In that case, the actor could recover costs
under both exceptions.  
Second, and for similar reasons, an actor would not be permitted to
recover costs that are  
speculative. The exception would not apply to “opportunity costs,” such
as the revenues that an  
actor could have earned had it not provided the interoperability
elements. We clarify that the  
exclusion of opportunity costs would not preclude an actor from
recovering its reasonable  
forward-looking cost of capital. We believe these costs are relatively
concrete and that permitting  
their recovery will protect incentives for actors to invest in
developing and providing  
interoperability elements.  
*Fee Prohibited by 45 CFR 164.524(c)(4)*  
We also propose that the exception would not apply to fees prohibited by
45 CFR  
164.524(c)(4). The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits a covered entity to impose
a reasonable, cost-  
based fee if the individual requests a copy of the PHI (or agrees to
receive a summary or  
explanation of the information). The fee may include only the cost of:
(1) labor for copying the  
PHI requested by the individual, whether in paper or electronic form;
(2) supplies for creating the  
paper copy or electronic media (e.g., CD or USB drive) if the individual
requests that the  
electronic copy be provided on portable media; (3) postage, when the
individual requests that the  
copy, or the summary or explanation, be mailed; and (4) preparation of
an explanation or  
summary of the PHI, if agreed to by the individual (45 CFR
164.524(c)(4)). The fee may not  
include costs associated with verification; documentation; searching for
and retrieving the PHI;  
maintaining systems; recouping capital for data access, storage, or
infrastructure; or other costs  
not listed above even if such costs are authorized by state law.

<span id="452"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **452** of **724**  
  
*Individual Electronic Access*  
We propose that this exception would not apply if the actor charged a
fee based in any  
part on the electronic access by an individual or their personal
representative, agent, or designee  
to the individual’s EHI. Such fees are distinguished from the cost-based
fees that a covered entity  
is permitted to charge individuals for the provision of copies of ePHI
under HIPAA (45 CFR  
164.524(c)(4)), and similar allowable costs under state privacy laws,
which would not be  
excluded from the costs recoverable under this exception. To be clear,
access to EHI that is  
provisioned by supplying some form of physical media, such as paper
copies (where the EHI is  
printed out), or where EHI is copied onto a CD or flash-drive, would not
be a practice that  
implicated the information blocking provision provided that the fee(s)
charged for that access  
complied with HIPAA (45 CFR 164.524(c)(4)).  
A fee based on electronic access by an individual or their personal
representative, agent,  
or designee to the individual’s EHI, in contrast, would arise if an
actor sought to impose on  
individuals, or their personal representatives, agents, or designees, a
fee that operated as a toll for  
the provision of electronic access. For example, a health care provider
that charges individuals a  
fee in order that the individuals be given access to their EHI via the
health care provider’s patient  
portal or another mode of web-based delivery, would not be able to
benefit from this exception.  
Similarly, where an individual authorizes a consumer-facing app to
retrieve EHI on the  
individual’s behalf, it would be impermissible for an actor to charge
the app or its developer a  
fee to access or use APIs that enable access to the individual’s EHI.
This would be true whether  
the actor is a supplier of the API technology or an individual or entity
that has deployed the API  
technology, such as a health care provider.

*Export and Portability of EHI Maintained in EHR Systems*  
  
The definition of information blocking specifically mentions transitions
between health  
IT systems and the export of complete information sets as protected
forms of access, exchange,  
and use (*see* section 3022(a)(2)(C)(i) of the PHSA). In our experience,
health care providers  
frequently encounter rent-seeking and opportunistic pricing practices in
these and other contexts  
in which they are attempting to export EHI from their systems for use in
connection with other  
technologies or services that compete with or could reduce the revenue
opportunities associated  
with an EHR developer’s own suite of products and services. As discussed
in section  
VIII.C.5.b.iii of this preamble, most EHI is currently maintained in
EHRs and other source  
systems that use proprietary data models or formats; this puts EHR
developers in a unique  
position to block the export and portability of EHI for use in competing
systems or applications,  
or to charge rents for access to the basic technical information needed
to facilitate the conversion  
or migration of data for these purposes. The concerns are compounded by
the fact that EHR  
developers rarely disclose in advance the fees they will charge for data
export and data  
portability services (*see* 80 FR 62719; 80 FR 16880–81).  
  
For the reasons above, we propose that fees charged for the export,
conversion, or  
migration of data from an EHR technology would not qualify for the
exception unless they also  
meet two additional conditions.  
First, we propose that health IT developers of certified health IT
would, for purposes of  
this exception, be precluded from charging a fee to perform an export of
EHI via the capability  
of health IT certified to the proposed 2015 Edition “EHI export”
certification criterion (§  
170.315(b)(10)) for the purposes of switching health IT systems or to
provide patients their EHI.

As part of the “Assurances” Condition of Certification, health IT
developers that produce and  
electronically manage EHI would need to be certified to the “EHI export”
criterion and provider  
the functionality to its customers (*see* § 170.402(a)(4) and section
VII.B.2.b of this preamble).  
As described in section IV.C.1 of this preamble, the “EHI export”
certification criterion is  
intended to provide a baseline capability to export EHI from certified
health IT in a  
commercially reasonable format in support of transitioning of EHI
between health IT systems  
and patient access. Fees or limitations associated with the use of this
capability (as distinguished  
from deployment or other costs reasonably incurred by the developer)
would not receive  
protection under the exception and may be suspect under the information
blocking provision. We  
clarify that this condition would not preclude a developer from charging
a fee to deploy the EHI  
export capability in a health care provider’s production environment, or
to provide additional  
services in connection with this capability other than those reasonably
necessary to enable its  
intended use. For example, this condition would not preclude a developer
from charging a fee to  
perform an export of EHI via the capability of health IT certified to
the proposed §  
170.315(b)(10) for a third-party analytics company. We emphasize once
again that these  
excluded fees are distinguished from the cost-based fees that a covered
entity is permitted to  
charge individuals for the provision of copies of ePHI under HIPAA (45
CFR 164.524(c)(4)),  
and similar allowable costs under state privacy laws, which would not be
excluded from the costs  
recoverable under this exception.  
We note that, because this certification criterion provides only a
baseline capability for  
exporting data, we anticipate that health IT developers of certified
health IT will need to provide  
other data portability services to facilitate the smooth transition of
health care providers between

different health IT systems. We propose that such fees may qualify for
protection under the  
exception, but only if they meet the other conditions described above
and in proposed §  
171.205(a).  
Second, we propose that the exception would not apply to a fee to export
or convert data  
from an EHR technology unless such fee was agreed to in writing at the
time the technology was  
acquired, meaning when the EHR developer and the customer entered into a
contract or license  
agreement for the EHR technology. This condition is designed to promote
the disclosure of fees  
upfront and thereby reduce the potential for actors to engage in
installed-base opportunism or  
attempting to use fees to discourage data portability.  
*Compliance with the Condition of Certification Specific to API
Technology Suppliers and API*  
*Data Providers.*  
  
We note that health IT developers of certified health IT subject to the
API Condition of  
Certification proposed in § 170.404 may not charge certain types of fees
and are subject to more  
specific cost accountability provisions than apply generally under this
proposed exception. We  
believe that the failure of developers to comply with these additional
requirements would impose  
impediments to consumer and other stakeholder access to EHI without
special effort and would  
be suspect under the information blocking provision. We propose,
therefore, that a health IT  
developer of certified health IT subject to the API Condition of
Certification must comply with  
all requirements of that condition for all practices and at all relevant
times in order to qualify for  
this exception.  
  
We also believe that a health care provider that acts as an API Data
Provider, should be  
subject to the same constraints. For example, the API Condition of
Certification prohibits a

health IT developer from charging a usage fee to patient-oriented apps.
We believe information  
blocking concerns would arise if a provider were to charge such a fee,
notwithstanding the fact  
that the provider is not subject to the certification requirements. For
this reason, we propose that,  
if the actor is an API Data Provider, the actor is only permitted to
charge the same fees that an  
API Technology Supplier is permitted to charge to recover costs
consistent with the permitted  
fees specified in the Condition of Certification in § 170.404. In other
words, to the extent that a  
provider is an API Data Provider, the provider will not qualify for this
exception if it charges any  
fee that a health IT developer of certified health IT would be
prohibited from charging under the  
API Condition of Certification.  
*Application of the Exception to Individual Practices*  
  
We clarify that the conditions of this exception, including those
governing the  
methodology and criteria by which an actor calculates and distributes
its costs, must be satisfied  
for *each and every* fee that an actor charges to a customer, requestor,
or other person. For  
example, if an actor uses a cost allocation methodology that does not
meet the requirements of  
the exception, each fee charged on the basis of that methodology would
be a suspect practice  
under the information blocking provision. All applicable conditions of
the exception must be met  
at all relevant times for each practice.  
  
We request comment on this proposed exception. Specifically, we ask
commenters to  
consider alternate approaches to the exception that would also achieve
the goal of allowing  
actors to recover certain types of costs that would promote innovation,
competition and  
consumer welfare and that are unlikely to present information blocking
concerns. In assessing  
other potential approaches to this exception, we encourage commenters to
contemplate such

considerations as enforceability, potential burden on the parties, and
overall effectiveness in  
meeting the above stated goals. **  
5\. Responding to Requests that are Infeasible  
  
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking
provision that would  
permit an actor to decline to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI in
a manner that is  
infeasible, provided certain conditions are met. The exception and
corresponding conditions are  
set forth in the proposed regulation text in § 171.205. We propose that
this exception would not  
apply when a response is required by law. As discussed in section
VIII.C.5 of this preamble, we  
propose that the information blocking provision would be implicated if
an actor were to refuse to  
facilitate access, exchange, or use of EHI, either as a general practice
or in isolated instances.  
However, we believe that in certain circumstances legitimate practical
challenges beyond an  
actor’s control may limit its ability to comply with requests for
access, exchange, or use. In some  
cases, the actor may not have—and may be unable to obtain—the requisite
technological  
capabilities, legal rights, financial resources, or other means
necessary to provide a particular  
form of access, exchange, or use. In other cases, the actor may be able
to comply with the  
request, but only by incurring costs or other burdens that are clearly
unreasonable under the  
circumstances.  
  
Actors confronted with these types of practical challenges may be
concerned about their  
exposure under the information blocking provision, which could lead to
inefficient outcomes.  
For example, health care providers may feel compelled to entertain
requests to enable or support  
means of exchange or use that would be disruptive to health care
operations or that are not  
financially sustainable. In some of these instances, the actor may be
able, but reluctant, to offer

alternative means that would meet the requestor’s needs while reducing
the burden on the actor,  
leading to more efficient outcomes overall. Actors could also be forced
into a “reactive” posture  
that limits their ability to make holistic decisions and to implement
health IT in a considered,  
scalable way that facilitates robust interoperability and information
sharing. These outcomes  
would be counterproductive to the policies the information blocking
provision encompasses.  
  
The proposed exception would alleviate some of these concerns while
safeguarding  
against pretextual and other unreasonable refusals to provide access,
exchange, or use of EHI.  
The exception would permit an actor to decline a request in certain
narrowly-defined  
circumstances when doing so would be infeasible (or impossible) and when
the actor otherwise  
did all that it reasonably could do under the circumstances to
facilitate alternative means of  
accessing, exchanging, and using the EHI. We believe this approach is
principled and tailored in  
a manner that will promote basic fairness and encourage parties to work
cooperatively to  
implement efficient solutions to interoperability challenges.
Importantly, to ensure that the  
exception is not used inappropriately, we propose a structured,
fact-based approach for  
determining whether a request was in fact “infeasible” within the
meaning of this exception. This  
approach would be limited to a consideration of factors specifically
delineated in the exception  
and that focus the infeasibility inquiry on the immediate and direct
financial and operational  
challenges of facilitating access, exchange, and use, as distinguished
from more remote, indirect,  
or speculative types of injuries.  
  
We encourage comment on these and other aspects of this proposal, which
are described  
in more detail below.

To qualify for this proposed exception, in addition to meeting other
conditions, we  
propose that compliance with the request for access, exchange, or use
must be infeasible. We  
propose a two-step test that an actor would need to meet in order to
demonstrate that a request  
was infeasible.  
*Complying with the request would impose a substantial burden on the
actor.*  
  
Under the first step of the infeasibility test, the actor would need to
show that complying  
with the particular request in the manner requested would impose a
substantial burden on the  
actor that is unreasonable under the circumstances. We anticipate that
in most cases an actor  
would meet this requirement by showing that it did not have, and could
not readily obtain, the  
requisite technological capabilities, legal rights, or other means
necessary to facilitate the  
particular type of access, exchange, or use requested. Additionally, the
requirement could be met  
by showing that, had it complied with the request, the actor would have
experienced a significant  
disruption to its health care or business activities or would have
incurred significant unbudgeted  
costs. We would also consider other analogous outcomes that impact the
actor’s health care or  
business activities in a direct and substantial way. We seek comment on
what those outcomes  
might be and encourage commenters to be as detailed and specific as
possible.  
  
In determining whether these or other types of burdens are substantial,
we would consider  
the actor’s particular circumstances, including the type of actor; the
nature and purpose of its  
business or other activities; and the financial, technical, and other
resources and expertise at its  
disposal. In addition, we would also consider any offsetting benefits to
the actor of providing the  
requested access, exchange, or use, such as facilitating the actor’s
compliance with statutory and

regulatory requirements. Due to the variability of circumstances, ONC
would take a fact-specific  
approach to these analyses.  
As an illustration, a small physician practice with limited financial
and technical  
resources may find it burdensome to accommodate requests from other
providers to establish and  
maintain outbound interfaces from the practice’s EHR system that it
neither needs for its own  
health care activities nor to comply with any regulatory requirements.
In contrast, a large health  
system with a well-resourced IT department may be in a position to
accommodate such requests  
without significant disruption to its business and at relatively minimal
additional expense relative  
to its overall IT budget. Similarly, custom development or other
activities that might be  
burdensome for a health care provider with limited technical expertise
may not result in a  
substantial burden for a health IT developer, exchange, or network whose
business is to develop  
and provide technological solutions.  
  
We clarify that the exception focuses solely on the immediate and direct
financial and  
operational challenges of facilitating access, exchange, or use. The
exception does not apply—  
and we would give no weight—to any putative burdens that an actor
experiences that relate  
primarily to the actor’s pursuit of an economic advantage, such as its
ability to charge higher  
prices, capture additional revenue streams, maintain or increase its
market share, or otherwise  
pursue its own economic interests. To the extent that these interests
merit an exception under the  
information blocking provision, they are addressed under the exceptions
proposed in §§ 171.204  
and 171.206. In the same way, the exception would not apply to any
putative burdens that are  
more appropriately examined under another proposed exception. For
example, an actor could not  
claim that it is burdensome to implement a tailored organizational
patient safety policy under

proposed § 171.201(b) or to develop and implement policies and
procedures for satisfying  
preconditions imposed by state or federal privacy laws for the provision
of access, exchange, or  
use of EHI under proposed § 171.202(b).  
*The burden imposed on the actor would be plainly unreasonable under the
circumstances.*  
  
To show that a request for access, exchange, or use was infeasible, the
actor must not  
only demonstrate that complying with the request would have resulted in
a substantial burden, as  
described above; the actor must also demonstrate that requiring it to
comply with the request—  
and thus to assume the substantial burden demonstrated under the first
part of the test—would  
have been plainly unreasonable under the circumstances. Whether it would
have been plainly  
unreasonable for the actor to assume the burden of providing access,
exchange, or use will be  
highly dependent on the particular facts and circumstances. While for
this reason we do not  
believe that bright-line rules would be appropriate, we do propose to
rely primarily on the  
following key factors enumerated in proposed § 171.205(a)(1):  
• The type of EHI and the purposes for which it may be needed;  
• The cost to the actor of complying with the request in the manner
requested;  
• The financial, technical, and other resources available to the
actor;  
• Whether the actor provides comparable access, exchange, or use to
itself or to its customers,  
suppliers, partners, and other persons with whom it has a business
relationship;  
• Whether the actor owns or has control over a predominant technology,
platform, health  
information exchange, or health information network through which EHI is
accessed or  
exchanged;

<span id="462"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **462** of **724**  
  
• Whether the actor maintains ePHI on behalf of a covered entity, as
defined in 45 CFR  
160.103, or maintains EHI on behalf of the requestor or another person
whose access,  
exchange, or use of EHI will be enabled or facilitated by the actor’s
compliance with the  
request;  
• Whether the requestor and other relevant persons can reasonably
access, exchange, or use the  
information from other sources or through other means; and  
• The additional cost and burden to the requestor and other relevant
persons of relying on  
alternative means of access, exchange, or use.  
  
As these factors suggest, the starting point for our inquiry would be to
identify the type of  
EHI at issue and the purposes for which it may be needed. As explained
in section VIII.C.5.b.i.  
of this preamble, certain types of EHI—namely, observational health
information—give rise to a  
heightened risk of interference under the information blocking
provision. For purposes of this  
exception and the information blocking provision more generally, the
actor has a strong duty to  
facilitate the availability and use of this information, which may be
needed for important  
activities for which timely and complete access to EHI is essential,
such as providing patients  
with their EHI; enabling the use of EHI for treatment and care
coordination; and making EHI  
available for quality improvement and population health management
activities.  
  
Next, we would consider the severity of the burdens that the actor would
have  
experienced to provide the access, exchange, or use of EHI in the manner
requested. For this  
purpose, we would consider both the burden on the actor of complying
with the specific request  
at issue as well as the burden the actor would experience if it was
required to comply with  
similar types of requests. We would also consider the observed or likely
frequency of such

<span id="463"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **463** of **724**  
  
requests. As already discussed, we anticipate that the extent of any
burden would depend in part  
on the particular circumstances of the actor. In addition, in
considering the burden to the actor,  
we would also consider any offsetting benefits to the actor of providing
the requested access,  
exchange, or use.  
  
Having ascertained the nature and severity of any burdens that the actor
would assume to  
provide the requested access, exchange, or use, we would balance these
burdens against the  
countervailing costs to the requestor and other persons (including
consumers) who would be  
harmed by the actor’s refusal to provide the requested access, exchange,
or use. Importantly, we  
would consider whether the requestor and other persons could have
obtained the EHI from other  
sources or through other means, including those made available by the
actor as an  
accommodation to the requestor, as discussed in more detail below. If
alternative means were  
available, we would examine the extent to which they would have been
appropriate for the  
purposes for which the EHI or interoperability elements were needed and
the extent to which  
requiring the requestor to pursue these alternative means would impose
additional costs or  
burdens on the requestor and other persons. For example, if the EHI was
readily available  
through other means that were equally efficacious, the actor’s refusal
to provide yet one more  
means of access, exchange, or use might impose only a minimal burden on
the requestor and  
other persons’ use of the EHI. In contrast, if the actor conditions
critical technology or  
infrastructure for accessing, exchanging, or using EHI, or if its
control over other interoperability  
elements means that EHI cannot be efficiently accessed, exchanged, or
used without the actor’s  
cooperation, requiring the requestor to pursue other means of access,
exchange, or use would  
likely be unrealistic and represent an insurmountable burden.

<span id="464"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **464** of **724**  
  
  
One final consideration would inform our analysis. We would consider the
balancing of  
relative burdens in conjunction with the actor’s control over
interoperability elements. As an  
example, a dominant health IT developer of certified health IT or
network that refuses to  
facilitate a particular form of access, exchange, or use with other
entities would have to  
demonstrate an extreme burden relative to the need for access, exchange,
or use in order to  
qualify for this exception. This exacting standard would also apply in
other circumstances of  
dependence or reliance on the actor to facilitate access, exchange, or
use. For example, a  
dominant health system that provides local health IT infrastructure
would have to demonstrate an  
extreme hardship to justify denying interconnection requests or access
to interoperability  
elements. Likewise, where the actor is a business associate of a covered
entity, or owes some  
other special duty to the requestor, the actor could not qualify for
this exception unless the cost  
or burden it would have borne was so extreme in comparison to the
marginal benefits to the  
requestor that the request was clearly unreasonable by any objective
measure.  
We acknowledge that there may be situations when complying with a
request for access,  
exchange, or use would be considered infeasible because an actor is
unable to provide such  
access, exchange, or use due to unforeseeable or unavoidable
circumstances that are outside the  
actor’s control. For example, an actor could seek coverage under this
exception if it is unable to  
provide access, exchange, or use of EHI due to a natural disaster (such
as a hurricane, tornado or  
earthquake) or war. These are just a couple examples of such
circumstances and are by no means  
an exhaustive list.  
We emphasize that, consistent with the requirements for demonstrating
that activities and  
practices meet the conditions of an exception proposed in section
VIII.C.6.c of this preamble, the

actor would need to produce evidence and ultimately prove that complying
with the request for  
access, exchange, or use in the manner requested would have imposed a
clearly unreasonable  
burden on the actor under the circumstances.  
We note that there are certain circumstances that we propose would not
constitute a  
burden to the actor for purposes of this exception and shall not be
considered in determining  
whether complying with a request would have been infeasible. We propose
that it would not be  
considered a burden if providing the requested access, exchange, or use
in the manner requested  
would have (1) facilitated competition with the actor; or (2) prevented
the actor from charging a  
fee. Throughout this proposed rule, we have highlighted that one of the
goals of the information  
blocking section is to promote competition, and allowing the argument
that a request is infeasible  
because it facilitates competition with the actor would be antithetical
to this goal. Similarly, an  
argument that a request is infeasible because it prevents the actor from
charging a fee would also  
be outside the scope of this exception because such a result would not
constitute a substantial,  
unreasonable burden that this exception seeks to address.  
  
We request comment on the structured, fact-based approach we have
proposed for  
determining whether a request was in fact “infeasible” within the
meaning of this exception. We  
encourage comment on, among other issues, whether the factors we have
specifically delineated  
above properly focus the infeasibility inquiry; whether our approach to
weighing these factors is  
appropriate; and whether there are additional burdens, distinct from the
immediate and direct  
financial and operational challenges contemplated above, that are
similarly concrete and should  
be considered under the fact-based rubric of this exception.

In addition to demonstrating that a particular request or class of
requests was infeasible,  
we propose that an actor would have to show that it satisfied several
additional conditions.  
Specifically, to qualify for this exception, the actor must have timely
responded to all requests  
relating to access, exchange, and use of EHI, including but not limited
to requests to establish  
connections and to provide interoperability elements. Further, for any
request that the actor  
claims was infeasible, the actor must have provided the requestor with a
detailed written  
explanation of the reasons why the actor could not accommodate the
request. Finally, the actor  
must have worked with the requesting party in a timely manner to
identify and provide a  
reasonable alternative means of accessing, exchanging, or using the EHI,
as applicable. The  
actor’s failure to meet any of these conditions would disqualify the
actor from the exception and  
could also be evidence that the actor knew that it was engaging in
practices that contravened the  
information blocking provision.  
  
We clarify that the duty to timely respond and provide reasonable
cooperation would  
necessarily be assessed from the standpoint of what is objectively
reasonable for an individual or  
entity in the actor’s position. For example, we would not expect a small
physician practice to  
provide the same level of engagement and technical assistance to third
parties as a large hospital  
or health system with considerable health IT resources and expertise at
its disposal. In some  
circumstances, it may even be difficult for a small practice to comply
with any request for  
access, exchange, and use that is more complicated than a simple request
for a patient’s personal  
health information. If there are such requests – and there could be –
then small practices may be  
both unable to comply with such requests and poorly situated to assist
requesting parties with

alternatives. We provide these examples to emphasize that we will look
at the specific facts and  
circumstances of each case to determine what is objectively
reasonable.  
  
We believe that these conditions will minimize the risk that this
exception could protect  
improper refusals to provide interoperability elements, including naked
refusals to deal as well as  
other practices, such as improper delays in access or exchange that
would present information  
blocking concerns. Additionally, the requirements for an actor to timely
respond and document  
its justifications for declining a request in writing would prevent an
actor from using post hoc  
rationalizations to justify these and other improper practices. Finally,
we believe that establishing  
a clear duty under the exception for actors to deal on reasonable terms
with parties seeking to  
access, exchange, or use EHI will encourage parties to cooperate to
identify and implement  
efficient solutions to interoperability challenges, thereby avoiding
disputes that could lead to  
information blocking.  
  
We encourage comment on the additional conditions and related
considerations described  
above. Specifically, we request comment regarding potential obstacles to
satisfying these  
conditions and improvements we could make to the proposed process.  
6\. Licensing of Interoperability Elements on Reasonable and
Non-discriminatory Terms  
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking
provision that would  
permit actors to license interoperability elements on reasonable and
non-discriminatory (RAND)  
terms, provided that certain conditions are met. The exception and
corresponding conditions are  
set forth in the proposed regulation text in § 171.206. As discussed in
section VIII.C.5.a of this  
preamble, the information blocking provision would be implicated if an
actor were to refuse to  
license or allow the disclosure of interoperability elements to persons
who require those elements

to develop and provide interoperable technologies or services—including
those that might  
complement or compete with the actor’s own technology or services.
Moreover, the information  
blocking provision would be implicated if the actor licensed such
interoperability elements  
subject to terms or conditions that have the purpose or effect of
excluding or discouraging  
competitors, rivals, or other persons from engaging in these
pro-competitive and interoperability-  
enhancing activities. Thus, this licensing requirement would apply in
both vertical and horizontal  
relationships. For instance, it would apply when a developer in a
vertical relationship to the  
actor—a network in this example—wants to use interoperability elements
in order to access the  
EHI maintained in the actor’s network. The requirement would also apply
when a rival network  
in a horizontal relationship to the actor (network) wants to use
interoperability elements so that  
its network can be compatible with the applications that have already
been developed for use  
with the actor’s network.  
We note that some licensees do not require the interoperability elements
to develop  
products or services that can be interoperable with the actor’s health
IT. For instance, there may  
be firms that simply want to license the actor’s technology for use in
developing their own  
interoperability elements. Their interest would be for access to the
technology itself – not for the  
use of the technology to interoperate with either the actor or its
customers. This may be the case,  
for example, if the relevant intellectual property included patents that
were applicable to other  
information technology applications outside of health IT. In such cases,
the actor’s licensing of  
its patents in such a context would *not* implicate the information
blocking provision.  
Below are examples of situations that *would implicate* the information
blocking provision  
(these examples are not exhaustive):

• An actor refuses to negotiate a license after receiving a request from
a developer.  
• An actor offers a license at the request of a developer, but only at a
royalty rate that exceeds a  
RAND rate.  
• An actor offers a license to a competitor at a royalty rate
significantly higher than was  
offered to a party not in direct competition with the actor.  
• An actor files a patent infringement lawsuit against a developer
without first offering to  
negotiate a license on RAND terms.  
There are compelling reasons for this prohibition. In our experience,
contractual and  
intellectual property rights are frequently used to extract rents for
access to EHI or to prevent  
competition from developers of interoperable technologies and services
(*see* section  
VIII.C.5.c.iv. of this preamble). These practices frustrate access,
exchange, and use of EHI and  
stifle competition and innovation in the health IT sector. As a case in
point, even following the  
enactment of the Cures Act, some EHR developers are selectively
prohibiting—whether  
expressly or through commercially unreasonable terms—the disclosure or
use of technical  
interoperability information required for third-party applications to be
able to access, exchange,  
and use EHI maintained in EHR systems. This limits health care
providers’ use of the EHI  
maintained on their behalf to the particular capabilities and use cases
that their EHR developer  
happens to support. More than this, by limiting the ability of providers
to choose what  
applications and technologies they can use with their EHR systems, these
practices close off the  
market to innovative applications and services that providers and other
stakeholders need to  
deliver greater value and choice to health care purchasers and
consumers.

Despite these serious concerns, we recognize that the definition of
information blocking  
may be broader than necessary and could have unintended consequences. In
contrast to the  
practices described above, we believe it is generally appropriate for
actors to license their  
intellectual property (IP) on RAND terms that do not block
interoperability. Provided certain  
conditions are met, we believe that these practices would further the
goals of the information  
blocking provision by allowing actors to protect the value of their
innovations and earn returns  
on the investments they have made to develop, maintain, and update those
innovations. This in  
turn will protect future incentives to invest in, develop, and
disseminate interoperable  
technologies and services. Conversely, if actors cannot (or believe they
cannot) protect and  
commercialize their innovations, they may not engage in these productive
activities that improve  
access, exchange, and use of EHI.  
  
While we believe this exception is necessary to promote competition and
consumer  
welfare, we are highly sensitive to the danger that actors will continue
to use their contractual  
and IP rights to interfere with access, exchange, and use of EHI,
undermining the information  
blocking provision’s fundamental objectives. For this reason, the
exception would be subject to  
strict conditions to ensure, among other things, that actors license
interoperability elements on  
RAND terms and that they do not impose collateral terms or engage in
other practices that would  
impede the use of the interoperability elements or otherwise undermine
the intent of this  
exception.  
We acknowledge that preventing intellectual property holders from
extracting rents for  
access to EHI may differ from standard intellectual property policy.
Absent specific  
circumstances, IP holders are generally free to negotiate with
prospective licensees to determine

the royalty to practice their IP, and this negotiated royalty frequently
reflects the value the  
licensee would obtain from exercising those rights. However, in the
context of EHI, we propose  
that a limitation on rents is essential due to the likelihood that rents
will frustrate access,  
exchange, and use of EHI, particularly because of the power dynamics
that exist in the health IT  
market.  
  
We remind readers that actors are not required to seek the protection of
this (or any other)  
exception. If an actor does not want to license a particular technology,
it may choose to comply  
with the information blocking provision in another way, such as by
developing and providing  
alternative means of accessing, exchanging, and using EHI that are
similarly efficient and  
efficacious. The purpose of this exception is not to dictate a licensing
scheme for all, or even  
most, health IT, but rather to provide a tailored “safe harbor” that
will provide clear expectations  
for those who desire it.  
  
  
  
i. Reasonable and Non-discriminatory (RAND) Terms  
  
We propose to require, as a condition of this exception, that any terms
upon which an  
actor licenses interoperability elements must be reasonable and
non-discriminatory (RAND). As  
discussed below, commitments to license technology on RAND terms are
frequently required in  
the context of standards development organizations (SDOs), and we
believe that the practical and  
policy considerations that have led SDOs to adopt these policies are
related in many respects to  
the information blocking concerns presented when an actor exploits
control over interoperability  
elements to extract economic rents or impede the development or use of
interoperable  
technologies and services.

We recognize that strong legal protections for IP rights can promote
competition and  
innovation.[125](ONCs.html#472)Nevertheless, IP rights can also be
misused in ways that undermine these goals.[126](ONCs.html#472)  
We believe this potential for abuse is heightened when the IP rights
pertain to functional aspects  
of technology that are essential to enabling interoperability. As an
important example, a  
technology developer may encourage the inclusion of its technology in an
industry standard  
created by an SDO while not disclosing that it has IP rights in that
technology. After the SDO  
incorporates the technology into its standard, and industry begins to
make investments tied to the  
standard, the IP-holder may then assert its IP rights and demand
royalties or license terms that it  
could not have achieved before the standard was adopted because
companies would incur  
substantial switching costs to abandon initial designs or adopt
different products.[127](ONCs.html#472)To address  
these types of concerns, while balancing the legitimate interests and
incentives of IP owners,  
many SDOs now have policies requiring members who contribute
technologies to a standard to  
voluntarily commit to license that technology on RAND terms and will
consider whether firms  
have made voluntary RAND commitments when weighing whether to include
their technology  
in standards.[128](ONCs.html#472) While this commitment to license on
RAND terms is voluntary as compared to

our proposed requirement to use RAND terms, it serves to illustrate how
RAND terms can be  
used to address such concerns.  
  
Similar concerns arise when actors who control proprietary
interoperability elements  
demand royalties or license terms from competitors or other persons who
are technologically  
dependent on the use of those interoperability elements. As discussed in
section VIII.C.5 of this  
preamble, to the extent that the interoperability elements are essential
to enable the efficient  
access, exchange, or use of EHI by particular persons or for particular
purposes, any practice by  
the actor that could impede the use of the interoperability elements for
that purpose—or that  
could unnecessarily increase the cost or other burden of using the
elements for that purpose—  
would give rise to an obvious risk of interference with access,
exchange, or use of EHI under the  
information blocking provision.  
  
We believe that a RAND requirement would balance the need for robust IP
protections  
with the need to ensure that this proposed exception does not permit
actors to exercise their IP or  
other proprietary rights in inappropriate ways that block the
development, adoption, or use of  
interoperable technologies and services. The exercise of IP rights in
these ways is incompatible  
with the information blocking provision, which protects the investments
that taxpayers and the  
health care industry have made to adopt technologies that will enable
the efficient sharing of EHI  
to benefit consumers and the health care system. While actors are
entitled to protect and exercise  
their IP rights, to benefit from this exception to the information
blocking provision they must do  
so in a reasonable and non-discriminatory manner that does not undermine
these efforts and  
impede the appropriate flow of EHI.

Accordingly, we propose that, to qualify for this exception, an actor
must license  
requested interoperability elements on RAND terms. To comply with this
condition, any terms or  
conditions under which the actor discloses or allows the use of
interoperability elements must  
meet several requirements set forth below. These requirements apply to
both price terms (such as  
royalties and license fees) and other terms, such as conditions or
limitations on access to  
interoperability elements or the purposes for which they can be used.  
*Responding to requests.*  
  
We propose that, upon receiving a request to license or use
interoperability elements, an  
actor would be required to respond to the requestor within 10 business
days from receipt of the  
request. We note that the request could be made to “license” or “use”
the interoperability  
elements because a requestor may not always know that “license” is the
legal mechanism for  
“use” when making the request. This provision is intended to ensure that
a requestor is given an  
opportunity to license *and* use interoperability elements. As such, the
requirement for responding  
to requests should not be limited to requests to “license.”  
In order to meet this requirement, the actor would be required to
respond to the requestor  
within 10 business days from the receipt of the request by: (1)
negotiating with the requestor in a  
RAND fashion to identify the interoperability elements that are needed;
and (2) offering an  
appropriate license with RAND terms, consistent with its other
obligations under this exception.  
We emphasize that, in order to qualify for this proposed exception, the
actor is only required to  
*negotiate* with the requestor in a RAND fashion and to *offer* a
license with RAND terms. The  
actor is not required to *grant* a license in all instances. For
example, the actor would not be

<span id="475"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **475** of **724**  
  
required to grant a license if the requestor refuses an actor’s offer to
license interoperability  
elements on RAND terms.  
We emphasize that there would be circumstances under which the actor
could pursue  
legal action against parties that infringe its intellectual property
whilst complying with this  
exception. For instance, an actor could bring legal action if a firm
appropriates the actor’s  
intellectual property without requesting a license or after refusing to
accept a license on RAND  
terms.  
We do not propose a set timeframe for when the negotiations must be
resolved because it  
is difficult to predict the duration of such negotiations. For instance,
there could be situations  
when the actor and requestor meet once and the actor makes a RAND offer
that is immediately  
accepted by the requestor. However, there could be other situations when
the requestor and actor  
each make counteroffers, which would extend the negotiations.  
We request comment on whether 10 business days is an appropriate amount
of time for  
the actor to respond to the requestor. In proposing this timeframe, we
considered the urgency of  
certain requests to license interoperability elements and our
expectation that developers would  
have standard licenses at their disposal that could be adapted in these
situations. We considered  
proposing response timeframes ranging from 5 business days to 15
business days. We also  
considered proposing two separate timeframes for: (1) negotiating with
the requestor; and (2)  
offering the license. If commenters prefer a different response
timeframe or approach than  
proposed, we request that commenters explain their rationale with as
much detail as possible.  
In addition, we query whether we should create set limits for: (1) the
amount of time the  
requestor has to accept the actor’s initial offer or make a
counteroffer; (2) if the requestor makes

a counteroffer, the amount of time the actor has to accept the
requestor’s counteroffer or make its  
own counteroffer; and (3) an allowable number of counteroffers in
negotiations.  
*Scope of rights.*  
To qualify for this proposed exception, we propose that the actor must
license the  
requested interoperability elements with all rights necessary to access
and use the interoperability  
elements for the following purposes, as applicable:  
• All rights necessary to access and use the interoperability elements
for the purpose of  
developing products or services that are interoperable with the actor’s
health IT or with  
health IT under the actor’s control and/or any third party who currently
uses the actor’s  
interoperability elements to interoperate with the actor’s health IT or
health IT under the  
actor’s control. These rights would include the right to incorporate and
use the  
interoperability elements in the licensee’s own technology to the extent
necessary to  
accomplish this purpose.  
• All rights necessary to market, offer, and distribute the
interoperable products and services  
described above to potential customers and users, including the right to
copy or disclose the  
interoperability elements as necessary to accomplish this purpose.  
• All rights necessary to enable the use of the interoperable products
or services in production  
environments, including using the interoperability elements to access
and enable the  
exchange and use of electronic health information.  
  
We request comment on whether these rights are sufficiently inclusive to
support  
licensees in developing interoperable technologies, bringing them to
market, and deploying them  
for use in production environments. We also request comment on the
breadth of these required

rights and if they should be subject to any limitations that would not
interfere with the uses we  
have described above.  
*Reasonable royalty.*  
  
As a condition of this exception, we propose that if an actor charges a
royalty for the use  
of interoperability elements, the royalty base and rate must be
reasonable. Consistent with the  
requirements for demonstrating that activities and practices meet the
conditions of an exception  
proposed in section VIII.C.6.c, the actor would need to show that the
royalty base was  
reasonable and that the royalty was within a reasonable range for the
interoperability elements at  
issue. Importantly, we note that the reasonableness of any royalties
would be assessed solely on  
basis of the independent value of the actor’s technology to the
licensee’s product,[129](ONCs.html#477) *not* on any  
strategic value stemming from the actor’s control over essential means
of accessing, exchanging,  
or using electronic health information. For instance, the reasonableness
of royalties could not be  
assessed based on the strategic value stemming from the adoption of the
technology by  
customers or users, the switching costs associated with the technology,
or other circumstances of  
technological dependence described elsewhere in this preamble (see
section VIII.C.5). We note  
that “strategic value” would stem from the actor’s control over
essential means of accessing,  
exchanging, or using electronic health information. Limiting a
reasonable royalty to the value of  
the technology isolated from strategic value is similar in concept to
apportionment of reasonable  
royalties for the infringement of standard essential patents
(SEPs).[130](ONCs.html#477)In our context, permitting  
an actor to charge a royalty on the basis of these considerations would
effectively allow the actor

to extract rents on access, exchange, and use of EHI, which is contrary
to the goals of the  
information blocking provision.  
  
In evaluating the actor’s assertions and evidence that the royalty was
reasonable, we  
propose that ONC may consider the following factors:  
• The royalties received by the actor for the licensing of the
proprietary elements in other  
circumstances comparable to RAND-licensing circumstances.  
• The rates paid by the licensee for the use of other comparable
proprietary elements.  
• The nature and scope of the license.  
• The effect of the proprietary elements in promoting sales of other
products of the licensee  
and the licensor, taking into account only the contribution of the
elements themselves and not  
of the enhanced interoperability that they enable.  
• The utility and advantages of the actor’s interoperability element

customary in the particular

adoption of the actor’s  
technology.  
• The opinion testimony of qualified experts.  
• The amount that a licensor and a licensee would have agreed upon (at

These factors mirror those used by courts that have examined the
reasonableness of  
royalties charged pursuant to a commitment to an SDO to license
standard-essential technologies  
on RAND terms (*see Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola,
Inc.*;[131](ONCs.html#479) In re *Innovatio IP Ventures, LLC*  
*Patent Litig.*;[132](ONCs.html#479) and *Realtek Semiconductor Corp. v.
LSI Corp*[133)](ONCs.html#479). However, we have adapted  
the factors to the information blocking context as follows. In the SDO
context, the RAND  
requirement mitigates the risk that patent-holders will engage in “hold
up”—that is, charging  
excessive royalties that do not reflect the value of their contributions
to the standard, but rather  
reflect the costs associated with switching to alternative technologies
after a standard is adopted  
—and that the cumulative effect of such royalties will make the standard
too expensive to  
implement—a problem called “royalty stacking.”[134](ONCs.html#479)To
address the risks of hold-up and royalty  
stacking in the standards development context, a RAND license should
compensate a patentee

for their technical contribution to the technology embodied in a
standard, but should not  
compensate them for mere inclusion in the standard.  
  
Similarly, in the context of information blocking, we propose the RAND
inquiry focuses  
on whether the royalty demanded by the actor represents the independent
value of the actor’s  
proprietary technology. We propose that if the actor has licensed the
interoperability element  
through a standards development organization in accordance with such
organization’s policies  
regarding the licensing of standards-essential technologies on
reasonable and non-discriminatory  
terms, the actor may charge a royalty that is consistent with such
policies. Rather than asking  
whether the royalty inappropriately captures additional value derived
from the technology’s  
inclusion in the industry standard, we would ask whether the actor is
charging a royalty that is  
not based on the value of its technology (embodied in the
interoperability elements) but rather  
includes the strategic value stemming from the adoption of that
technology by customers or  
users. Thus, under this proposed approach and the factors set forth
above, we would consider the  
technical contribution of the actor’s interoperability elements to the
licensee’s products—such as  
any proprietary capabilities or features that the licensee uses in its
product—but would screen out  
any functional aspects of the actor’s technology that are used only to
establish interoperability  
and enable EHI to be accessed, exchanged, and used. Additionally, we
propose that to address  
the potential risk of royalty stacking we would need to consider the
aggregate royalties that  
would apply if owners of other essential interoperability elements made
royalty demands of the  
implementer. Specifically, we propose that, to qualify for this
exception, the actor must grant  
licenses on terms that are objectively commercially reasonable taking
into account the overall  
licensing situation, including the cost to the licensee of obtaining
other interoperability elements

that are important for the viability of the products for which it is
seeking to license  
interoperability elements from the actor.  
  
We clarify that, as proposed, this condition would not preclude an actor
from licensing its  
interoperability elements pursuant to an existing RAND commitment to an
SDO. We also note  
that, in addition to complying with the requirements described above, to
meet this proposed  
condition any royalties charged must meet the condition, proposed
separately below, that any  
license terms be non-discriminatory.  
  
We request comment on these aspects of the proposed exception.
Commenters are  
encouraged to consider, in particular, whether the factors and approach
we have described will  
be administrable and appropriately balance the unreasonable blocking by
actors of the use of  
essential interoperability elements with the need to provide adequate
assurance to investors and  
innovators that they will be able to earn a reasonable return on their
investments in interoperable  
technologies. If our proposed approach does not adequately balance these
concerns or would not  
achieve our stated policy goals, we ask that commenters suggest
revisions or alternative  
approaches. We ask that such comments be as detailed as possible and
provide rigorous  
economic justifications for any suggested revisions or alternative
approaches.  
*Non-discriminatory terms.*  
  
We propose that for this exception to apply the terms on which an actor
licenses and  
otherwise provides interoperability elements must be non-discriminatory.
This requirement  
would apply to both price and non-price terms, and thus would apply to
the royalty terms  
discussed immediately above as well as other types of terms that may be
included in licensing  
agreements or other agreements related to the provision or use of
interoperability elements.

To comply with this condition, the terms on which the actor licensed the
interoperability  
elements must be based on criteria that the actor applied uniformly for
all substantially similar or  
similarly situated classes of persons and requests. This requirement
addresses a root cause of  
information blocking*.* In order to be considered non-discriminatory,
such criteria would have to  
be objective and verifiable, not based on the actor’s subjective
judgment or discretion. We  
emphasize that this proposal does not mean that the actor must apply the
same terms for all  
persons or classes of persons requesting a license. However, any
differences in terms would have  
to be based on actual differences in the costs that the actor incurred
or other reasonable and non-  
discriminatory criteria. Moreover, we propose that any criteria upon
which an actor varies its  
terms or conditions would have to be both competitively neutral—meaning
that the criteria are  
not based in any part on whether the requestor or other person is a
competitor, potential  
competitor, or will be using EHI obtained via the interoperability
elements in a way that  
facilitates competition with the actor—and neutral as to the revenue or
other value that the  
requestor may be derived from access, exchange, or use of the EHI
obtained via the  
interoperability elements, including any secondary use of such EHI. We
believe these limitations  
are necessary in light of the potential for actors to use their control
over interoperability elements  
to engage in discriminatory practices that create unreasonable barriers
or costs for persons  
seeking to develop, offer, or use interoperable technologies to expand
access and enhance the  
exchange and use of EHI.  
  
To clarify our expectations for this proposed condition, we provide the
following  
illustration. Consider an EHR developer that establishes an “app store”
through which third-party  
developers can license the EHR developer’s proprietary APIs, which we
assume are separate

from the APIs required by the API Condition of Certification proposed in
§ 170.404. The EHR  
developer could charge a reasonable royalty and impose other reasonable
terms to license these  
interoperability elements. The terms and conditions could vary based on
neutral, objectively  
verifiable, and uniformly applied criteria. These might include, for
example, significantly greater  
resources consumed by certain types of apps, such as those that export
large volumes of data on a  
continuous basis, or the heightened risks associated with apps designed
to “write” data to the  
EHR database or to run natively within the EHR’s user interface. In
contrast, the EHR developer  
could *not* vary its terms and conditions based on subjective criteria,
such as whether it thinks an  
app will be “popular” or is a “good fit” for its ecosystem. Nor could it
offer different terms or  
conditions on the basis of objective criteria that are not competitively
neutral, such as whether an  
app “connects to” other technologies or services, provides capabilities
that the EHR developer  
plans to incorporate in a future release of its technology, or enables
an efficient means for  
customers to export data for use in other databases or technologies that
compete directly with the  
EHR developer. Similarly, the EHR developer could not set different
terms or conditions based  
on how much revenue or other value the app might generate from the
information it collects  
through the APIs, such as by introducing a revenue-sharing requirement
for apps that use data for  
secondary purposes that are very lucrative and for which the EHR
developer would like a “piece  
of the pie.” Such practices would disqualify the actor from this
exception and would implicate  
the information blocking provision.  
  
The foregoing conditions are not intended to limit an actor’s
flexibility to set different  
terms based on legitimate differences in the costs to different classes
of persons or in response to  
different classes of requests, so long as any such classification was in
fact based on neutral

criteria (in the sense described above) that are objectively verifiable
and were applied in a  
consistent manner for persons and/or requests within each class. As an
important example, the  
proposed condition would not preclude a covered actor from pursuing
strategic partnerships,  
joint ventures, co-marketing agreements, cross-licensing agreements, and
other similar types of  
commercial arrangements under which it provides more favorable terms
than for other persons  
with whom it has a more arms-length relationship. In these instances the
actor should have no  
difficulty identifying substantial and verifiable efficiencies that
demonstrate that any variations  
in its terms and conditions were based on objective and neutral
criteria. We do note an important  
caveat, however, specifically that a health IT developer of certified
health IT who is an “API  
Technology Supplier” under the Condition of Certification proposed in §
170.404 would not be  
permitted to offer different terms in connection with the APIs required
by that Condition of  
Certification. As discussed in section VII.B.4 of this preamble, we
propose that API Technology  
Suppliers are required to make these APIs available on terms that are no
less favorable than  
provided to their own customers, suppliers, partners, and other persons
with whom they have a  
business relationship. As noted below towards the end of our discussion
of this exception to the  
information blocking provision, the exception incorporates the API
Condition of Certification’s  
requirements in full for all health IT developers subject to that
condition.  
  
We welcome comments on the foregoing condition and requirements.  
*Collateral terms.*  
  
We propose five additional conditions that would reinforce the
requirements of this  
exception discussed above. These additional conditions would provide
bright-line prohibitions  
for certain types of collateral terms or agreements that we believe are
inherently likely to

interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. We propose that any
attempt to *require* a licensee  
or its agents or contractors to do or agree to do any of the following
would disqualify the actor  
from this exception and would be suspect under the information blocking
provision.  
  
First, the actor must not require the licensee or its agents or
contractors to not compete  
with the actor in any product, service, or market, including markets for
goods and services,  
technologies, and research and development. We are aware that such
agreements have been used  
to either directly exclude suppliers of interoperable technologies and
services from the market or  
to create exclusivity that reduces the range of technologies and options
available to health care  
providers and other health IT customers and users.  
Second, and for similar reasons, the actor must not require the licensee
or its agents or  
contractors to deal exclusively with the actor in any product, service,
or market, including  
markets for goods and services, technologies, and research and
development.  
Third, the actor must not require the licensee or its agents or
contractors to obtain  
additional licenses, products, or services that are not related to or
can be unbundled from the  
requested interoperability elements. This condition reinforces the
condition described earlier  
requiring that any royalties charged by the actor for the use of
interoperability elements be  
reasonable. Without this condition, we believe that an actor could
require a licensee to take a  
license to additional interoperability elements that the licensee does
not need or want, which  
could enable the actor to extract royalties that are inconsistent with
its RAND obligations under  
this exception. We clarify that this condition would not preclude an
actor and a willing licensee  
from agreeing to such an arrangement, so long as the arrangement was not
*required*.

<span id="486"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **486** of **724**  
  
  
Fourth, the actor must not condition the use of interoperability
elements on a requirement  
or agreement to license, grant, assign, or transfer the licensee’s own
IP to the actor. We believe it  
is inconsistent with the actor’s RAND licensing obligations under this
exception, and would raise  
information blocking concerns, for an actor to use its control over
interoperability elements as  
leverage to obtain a “grant back” of IP rights or other consideration
whose value may exceed that  
of a reasonable royalty. Consistent with our approach under other
conditions of this exception,  
this condition would not preclude an actor and a willing licensee from
agreeing to a cross-  
licensing, co-marketing, or other agreement if they so choose. However,
the actor cannot *require*  
the licensee to enter into such an agreement. The actor must offer the
option of licensing the  
interoperability elements without a promise to provide consideration
beyond a reasonable  
royalty. We note that in the SDO context, it can sometimes be consistent
with RAND terms to  
require that an SEP licensee also grant a cross-license to any SEPs that
it holds, provided that the  
cross-license is limited to patents essential to the licensed standard.
In this way, this condition  
differs from licensing in the SDO context.  
  
Finally, the actor must not condition the use of interoperability
elements on a requirement  
or agreement to pay a fee of any kind whatsoever unless the fee meets
either the narrowly crafted  
condition to this exception for a reasonable royalty, or, alternatively,
the fee satisfies the separate  
exception proposed in § 171.204, which permits the recovery of certain
costs reasonably  
incurred. As noted in section VIII.D.4, that exception generally does
not allow for the recovery  
of royalties or other fees associated with intangible assets. However,
the exception does allow for  
the reasonable and actual development and acquisition costs of such
assets.

<span id="487"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **487** of **724**  
  
We request comment on the categorical exclusions outlined above. In
particular, we  
encourage commenters to weigh in on our assumption that these practices
are inherently likely to  
interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. We also encourage
commenters to suggest any  
conceivable benefits that these practices might offer for
interoperability or for competition and  
consumers that we might have overlooked. Again, we ask that to the
extent possible commenters  
provide detailed economic rationale in support of their comments.  
*Non-disclosure agreement.*  
  
We propose that an actor would be permitted under this exception to
require a licensee to  
agree to a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to protect
the actor’s trade secrets,  
provided that the NDA is no broader than necessary to prevent the
unauthorized disclosure of the  
actor’s trade secrets. Further, we propose that the actor would have to
identify (in the NDA) the  
specific information that it claims as trade secrets, and that such
information would have to meet  
definition of a trade secret under applicable law. We believe these
safeguards are necessary to  
ensure that the NDA is not used to impose restrictions or burdensome
requirements that are not  
actually necessary to protect the actor’s trade secrets and that impede
the use of the  
interoperability elements. The use of an NDA for such purposes would
preclude an actor from  
qualifying for this exception and would implicate the information
blocking provision. We note  
that if the actor is a health IT developer of certified health IT, it
may be subject to the Condition  
of Certification proposed in § 170.403, which prohibits certain health
IT developer prohibitions  
and restrictions on communications about a health IT developer’s
technology and business  
practices. This exception would not in any way abrogate the developer’s
obligations to comply  
with that condition.

We encourage comment on this condition of the proposed exception.  
ii. Additional Requirements Relating to the Provision of
Interoperability  
Elements  
  
In addition to the conditions described above, we propose that an
actor’s practice would  
need to comply with additional conditions that ensure that actors who
license interoperability  
elements on RAND terms do not engage in separate practices that impede
the use of those  
elements or otherwise undermine the intent of this exception. These
conditions are analogous to  
the conditions described in our proposal above concerning collateral
terms but address a broader  
range of practices that may not be effected through the license
agreements themselves or that  
occur separately from the licensing negotiations and other dealings
between the actor and the  
licensee. Specifically, we propose that an actor would not qualify for
this exception if it engaged  
in a practice that had the purpose or effect of impeding the efficient
use of the interoperability  
elements to access, exchange, or use EHI for any permissible purpose; or
the efficient  
development, distribution, deployment, or use of an interoperable
product or service for which  
there is actual or potential demand. As an illustration, the exception
would not apply if the  
developer licensed its proprietary APIs for use by third-party apps but
then prevented or delayed  
the use of those apps in production environments by, for example,
restricting or discouraging  
customers from enabling the use of the apps, or engaging in “gate
keeping” practices, such as  
requiring apps to go through a vetting process and then applying that
process in a discriminatory  
or unreasonable manner.  
  
Finally, to ensure the actor’s commitments under this exception are
durable, we propose  
one additional safeguard: An actor cannot avail itself of this exception
if, having licensed the  
****

interoperability elements, the actor makes changes to the elements or
its technology that “break”  
compatibility or otherwise degrade the performance or interoperability
of the licensee’s products  
or services. We believe this condition is crucial given the ease with
which an actor could make  
subtle “tweaks” to its technology or related services that could disrupt
the use of the licensee’s  
compatible technologies or services and result in substantial
competitive and consumer injury.  
  
We clarify and emphasize that this proposed condition would in *no way*
prevent an actor  
from making improvements to its technology or responding to the needs of
its own customers or  
users. However, to benefit from the exception, the actor’s practice
would need to be necessary to  
accomplish these purposes and the actor must have afforded the licensee
a reasonable  
opportunity under the circumstances to update its technology to maintain
interoperability. We  
also recognize that an actor may have to suspend access or make other
changes immediately and  
without prior notice in response to legitimate privacy, security, or
patient safety-related  
exigencies. Such practices would be governed by the exceptions proposed
in section VIII.D of  
this preamble and thus would not need to qualify for this exception.  
  
  
  
  
iii. Compliance with Conditions of Certification  
  
As a final condition of this proposed exception, we propose that health
IT developers of  
certified health IT who are subject to the Conditions of Certification
proposed in §§ 170.402,  
170.403, and 170.404 must comply with all requirements of those
Conditions of Certification for  
all practices and at all relevant times. Several of the requirements of
these conditions mirror  
those of this exception. However, in some instances the Conditions of
Certification provide  
additional or more specific requirements that apply to the provision of
interoperability elements  
by developers of certified health IT. For example, developers subject to
the API Condition of

<span id="490"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **490** of **724**  
  
Certification must make certain public APIs available on terms that are
royalty free and no less  
favorable than provided to themselves and their customers, suppliers,
partners, and other persons  
with whom they have a business relationship. These more prescriptive
requirements reflect the  
specific obligations of health IT developers under the Program,
including the duty to facilitate  
the access, exchange, and use of information from patients’ electronic
health records without  
special effort. A health IT developer of certified health IT’s failure
to comply with these and  
other certification requirements that specifically support
interoperability would, in addition to  
precluding the developer from invoking this exception, be significant
evidence of information  
blocking.  
7\.  
Maintaining and Improving Health IT Performance  
We propose to establish an exception to the information blocking
provision for certain  
practices that are reasonable and necessary to maintain and improve the
overall performance of  
health IT, provided certain conditions are met. The proposed exception
would recognize as  
reasonable and necessary the practice of an actor making health IT under
its control temporarily  
unavailable to maintain or improve the health IT. The exception and
corresponding conditions  
are set forth in the proposed regulation text in § 171.207.  
  
EHI should be accessible and usable on demand by those that need it.
However, in order  
for this to happen, the health IT through which EHI is accessed,
exchanged, or used must  
perform properly and efficiently. This requires that health IT be
maintained and in some  
instances improved. The performance of such maintenance and improvements
sometimes  
requires that health IT is temporarily taken offline, which can
interfere with the access,  
exchange, and use of EHI. We believe this exception is necessary to
ensure that actors are not

temporary unavailability of EHI may cause interference with its access,
exchange, and use.  
Without this specific exception, there could be a significant risk that
actors may refrain from  
conducting maintenance and improvements of health IT out of fear that if
the purpose was not  
for preventing harm, promoting security, or for another reason covered
by the other exceptions,  
then their actions might contravene the information blocking
provision.  
This exception would apply to the unavailability of health IT occasioned
by both planned  
and unplanned maintenance and improvements. Planned maintenance or
improvements are  
typically carried out at regular intervals and address routine repairs,
updates, or new releases.  
Unplanned maintenance or improvements respond to urgent or
time-sensitive issues, which  
cannot wait for the occurrence of a pre-planned time period to implement
the required  
maintenance or improvements.  
This proposed exception acknowledges that the performance of health IT
is often  
measured by service level agreements that provide flexibility to ensure
that system availability is  
balanced with essential maintenance and improvements. Where the
provision of health IT is  
subject to an allowance for maintenance or improvement that has been
agreed to by the recipient  
of that health IT, we propose that neither that agreement, nor the
performance of it, should  
constitute information blocking, provided that certain conditions are
met.  
To ensure that the actor’s practice of making health IT, and in turn
EHI, unavailable for  
the purpose of carrying out maintenance or improvements is reasonable
and necessary, we have  
identified conditions that must be satisfied at all relevant times to
qualify for this exception.

*Unavailability of health IT must be for no longer than necessary to
achieve the*  
*maintenance or improvements for which the health IT was made
unavailable*  
Any unavailability of health IT must be for a period of time no longer
than necessary to  
achieve the maintenance or improvement purpose for which the health IT
is made unavailable.  
This condition recognizes the critical importance of access to EHI and
ensures that health IT is  
not made unavailable for longer than needed. For example, a health IT
developer of certified  
health IT that has the right under its contract with a large health
system to take its system offline  
for four hours each month to conduct routine maintenance would not
qualify for this exception if  
an information blocking claim was made about a period of unavailability
during which no  
maintenance was performed.  
Making this evaluation for unplanned maintenance or improvements will be
more  
difficult, because unplanned maintenance or improvements are typically
initiated in response to a  
threat or risk that needs to be responded to on an urgent basis and for
so long as the threat or risk  
persists. However, if, for example, an HIE identified a software failure
(not identified as a safety  
or security risk) that required immediate remediation necessitating the
actor take its health IT  
offline, the actor would be expected to bring the health IT back online
as soon as possible after  
the issue was resolved.  
*Unavailability of health IT for maintenance or improvements must be
implemented in a*  
*consistent and non-discriminatory manner*  
We propose that any unavailability of health IT occasioned by the
conduct of  
maintenance or improvements must be implemented in a consistent and
non-discriminatory  
manner. This condition provides a basic assurance that when health IT is
made unavailable for

the purpose of performing maintenance or improvements that the
unavailability is not abused by  
the actor that controls the health IT. For example, a health IT
developer of certified health IT  
would not qualify for this exception if the developer, using a standard
contract that provided a  
flexible allowance for planned maintenance or improvements, initiated
planned maintenance or  
improvements for a customer with an expiring health IT contract during a
time when users might  
reasonably be expected to access EHI, but conducted planned maintenance
or improvements for  
new customers in the middle of the night. However, this condition does
not require that actors  
conduct planned maintenance or improvements simultaneously, or require
that every health IT  
contract provide the same promises in regard to planned maintenance or
improvements. Indeed, a  
recipient of health IT may agree to a longer window for unavailability
in exchange for a reduced  
fee for system maintenance, which would not contravene this condition.  
*Unavailability of health IT for maintenance or improvements must be
agreed*  
In order to benefit from this exception, we propose that the
unavailability of health IT due  
to maintenance or improvements initiated by a health IT developer of
certified health IT, HIE, or  
HIN, must be agreed to by the individual or entity to whom the health IT
is supplied. The  
availability of health IT is typically addressed in a written contract
or other written agreements,  
that puts the recipient of the health IT on notice about the level of
EHI and health IT  
unavailability that can be expected for users of the health IT. By such
agreements, the recipient  
of the health IT willfully agrees to that level of planned and unplanned
unavailability (typically  
referred to in health IT contracts as “downtime”). Some health IT
contracts address the question  
of system availability by way of an “uptime warranty” that specifies the
maximum amount of  
unavailability for a specified period and the timing of any planned
unavailability.

We acknowledge that in some cases, health IT needs to be taken offline
or maintenance  
or improvements on an urgent basis and in a way that is not expressly
permitted under a health  
IT contract. An actor may still satisfy this proposed condition so long
as the maintenance or  
improvements are agreed to by the recipient of the health IT. This could
be achieved by way of  
an oral agreement reached between the parties by telephone, but we note
that because an actor  
must demonstrate that it satisfies the requirements of this exception,
it would be best practice for  
an actor to ensure the agreement was in writing or, at minimum,
contemporaneously  
documented.  
This proposed condition of this exception only applies when the
unavailability of health  
IT is caused by a health IT developer of certified health IT, HIE, or
HIN. In these circumstances,  
it is the supplier of the health IT that controls if and when health IT
is intentionally taken offline  
for maintenance or improvements. This condition does not apply when
health IT is made  
unavailable for maintenance or improvements at the initiative of a
recipient (or customer) of  
health IT, because in that case, the unavailability has, for the purpose
of this exception, nothing  
to do with the supplier. When it is a customer of health IT that
initiates unavailability, the  
unavailability would not need to be the subject of an agreement with the
supplier of that health  
IT, nor anyone else, in order for the customer of health IT to benefit
from this exception. For  
example, a health care provider that locally hosts and maintains its
health IT (being software  
supplied by a health IT developer) would not need to satisfy this
condition if it interfered with  
access to EHI by taking the health IT offline temporarily to conduct
maintenance. However, if  
the same health care provider was to receive a new release of the health
IT developer’s software,  
which was to be implemented by the developer and which required that the
health IT be taken

offline by the developer for 6 hours, then that unavailability, or an
allowance for it, would need  
to be the subject of prior agreement. Unavailability of health IT
initiated by a recipient of health  
IT (rather than the supplier of the health IT) would still need to
satisfy the other conditions of  
this exception, including that the unavailability be for a period of
time no longer than necessary  
to achieve the maintenance or improvements for which the health IT was
made unavailable.  
We note that this condition would need to be satisfied by any HIE or HIN
that sought to  
benefit from this exception in connection with any interference with
access, exchange, or use  
occasioned by an HIE or HIN making its health IT unavailable for the
purposes of conducting  
maintenance or improvements. An HIE would need to have secured the
agreement of those  
individuals or entities that use its exchange services, and a HIN would
need to have obtained the  
agreement of the network’s participants.  
  
*Interaction with Preventing Harm and Promoting Security Exceptions*  
When health IT is made unavailable for maintenance or improvements aimed
at  
preventing harm to a patient or other person, or securing EHI, an actor
must comply with the  
conditions specified in proposed § 171.201 or § 171.203 respectively, in
order to qualify for an  
exception to the information blocking provision. This condition ensures
that this exception  
cannot be used to avoid compliance with conditions applicable under
other exceptions. For  
example, if part of an EHR system was taken offline in response to a
health IT developer of  
certified health IT being alerted to the risk of corrupt or inaccurate
data being recorded or  
incorporated in a patient’s health record, any decision to make the EHR
unavailable on this basis  
to conduct unplanned maintenance or improvements would need to accord
with the conditions of  
the proposed exception for preventing harm (see § 171.201 and section
VIII.D.1 of this proposed

rule). Similarly, unavailability occasioned by maintenance or
improvements initiated to secure  
EHI in response to a suspected malware attack would need to either be
implemented in  
accordance with the actor’s organizational security policy that
satisfied the requirements of the  
proposed exception for promoting the security of EHI or if the practice
did not implement an  
organizational security policy, the actor must have made a determination
in each case, based on  
the particularized facts and circumstances, consistent with the
requirements of the exception (see  
§ 171.203(d) and section VIII.D.3 of this proposed rule).  
*Request for Comment*  
We seek comment on this exception generally. Specifically, we seek
comment on  
whether the proposed conditions impose appropriate limitations on
actor-initiated health IT  
maintenance or improvements that lead to EHI unavailability. Our goal is
to ensure that the  
exception is not abused, while at the same time recognizing reasonable
commercial arrangements  
entered into by parties for the proper maintenance and improvement of
health IT.  
We are also considering whether to expand this exception to capture a
broader class of  
practices that are the subject of reasonable commercial agreements and
which, in the absence of  
an exception, may be considered information blocking. That is, to extend
this exception or create  
new exceptions for additional types of practices that interfere with
access, exchange, or use of  
EHI, but that are the subject of free agreement and which are reasonable
and necessary. For  
example, we are considering whether a practice taken by an actor to
throttle or meter the  
availability or performance of health IT, where agreed to by the
recipient of that health IT, could  
ever be a practice that we recognize as not being information blocking
if such practice does not  
otherwise qualify under an existing exception.

<span id="497"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **497** of **724**  
  
As discussed in section VIII.C.5 of this preamble, we are aware that
actors can use  
commercial agreements to materially discourage, and in some instances
outright prohibit, certain  
instances of access, exchange, or use of EHI. For example, a HIN might
use a participation  
agreement to prohibit entities that receive EHI through the HIN from
transmitting that EHI to  
entities who are not participants of the HIN. Such an arrangement would
not be reasonable or  
necessary because there is no legitimate justification for it. However,
we are also aware of  
commercial arrangements that are not motivated by anti-competitive
considerations but that  
nonetheless have the effect of interfering with the access, exchange, or
use of EHI. For example,  
a health IT developer of certified health IT may agree to commercial
terms with a customer that  
have the effect of interfering with access, exchange, or use of EHI, but
which are designed to  
appropriately accommodate the customer’s limited resources, or to assure
the performance of  
certain health IT functionality.  
We expect that most reasonable and necessary commercial arrangements
that affect  
access, exchange, or use of EHI could be recognized under one or more of
the existing  
exceptions. However, we seek comment on whether there exists a class of
legitimate commercial  
arrangements that could implicate the information blocking provision,
but which would not  
benefit from the existing proposed exceptions.  
*E. Additional Exceptions - Request for Information*  
  
1\. Exception for Complying with Common Agreement for Trusted Exchange

Exchange Framework), including a common agreement for a common set of
rules for trusted  
exchange between HINs (Common Agreement). The most recent draft Trusted
Exchange  
Framework was released for public comment on January 5,
2018,[135](ONCs.html#498)however, a new draft will be  
released in the coming months.  
  
We are considering whether we would should propose, in a future
rulemaking, a narrow  
exception to the information blocking provision for practices that are
necessary to comply with  
the requirements of the Common Agreement. Such an exception may support
adoption of the  
Common Agreement and encourage other entities to participate in trusted
exchange through  
HINs that enter into the Common Agreement. It would do so by providing
protection if there are  
practices that are expressly required by the Common Agreement, or that
are necessary to  
implement such requirements, that might implicate the information
blocking provision and  
would not qualify for another exception. We note that such an exception
would be consistent  
with the complementary roles of the information blocking provision and
other provisions of the  
Cures Act that support interoperability and enhance the trusted exchange
of EHI (including the  
interoperable network exchange provisions at section 3001(c)(9) of the
PHSA, the definition of  
interoperability at section 3000(10) of the PHSA, and the conditions of
certification required by  
section 3001(c)(5)(D) of the PHSA).  
  
We expect that any proposal would be narrowly framed such that contract
terms, policies,  
or other practices that are not strictly necessary to comply with the
Common Agreement would  
not qualify for the exception. Similarly, we expect that the proposal
would provide that an actor

3022(a). These practices include, but are not limited to, health IT
products or developers of such  
products (or other entities offering such products to health care
providers) not being  
interoperable or resulting in information blocking; and false statements
by developers of certified  
health IT that they have not engaged in information blocking. Section

requires that this complaint process provide for the collection of such
information as the  
originating institution, location, type of transaction, system and

determined by  
the OIG to have committed information blocking shall be referred to the
appropriate agency to  
be subject to appropriate disincentives using authorities under
applicable federal law, as the  
Secretary sets forth through notice and comment rulemaking. However, we
note that these  
disincentives may not cover the full range of conduct within the scope
of section 3022(a)(1). We  
request information on disincentives or if modifying disincentives
already available under  
existing HHS programs and regulations would provide for more effective

which provides that in carrying out section 3022(d) of the PHSA, the
Secretary shall, to the

**IX. Registries Request for Information  
  
**  
Section 4005 (a) and (b) of the Cures Act focuses on interoperability
and bidirectional  
exchange between EHRs and registries, including clinician-led clinical
data registries. ONC is  
approaching these provisions from several angles to address the
technical capability of EHRs to  
exchange data with registries in accordance with applicable recognized
standards. Based on  
stakeholder engagement and public comments on prior ONC regulations, we
have identified a  
wide range of areas where the use of standards could significantly
improve bidirectional  
exchange with registries for a range of purposes, including public
health, quality reporting, and  
care quality improvement.  
  
As discussed in the “Strategy on Reducing Regulatory and Administrative
Burden  
Relating to the Use of Health IT and EHRs” draft report released by ONC
for public comment in  
December of 2018,[136](ONCs.html#502)health care providers are faced
with a myriad of federal public health  
reporting requirements and options that rely on both bidirectional
exchange and aggregation of  
clinical data. CDC, SAMHSA, FDA, HRSA, and USDA also fund state and
local public health  
jurisdictions to collect clinical data from health care providers. As
noted in the Cures Act,

are also a wide range of clinician-led quality and specialty clinical
data registries. Compounding  
these reporting requirements and options is, as reported by health care
providers, a lack of  
standardization across electronic infrastructure that has led to a
comparatively slow adoption of  
health IT systems among registries. This lack of interoperability
impacts not only data exchange  
between health care providers, but is a significant barrier to the
integration and potential use of  
clinical data received from a registry for quality improvement or
clinical care.  
  
For these reasons outlined above, we believe it is appropriate to
explore multiple  
approaches to advancing health IT interoperability for bidirectional
exchange with registries in  
order to mitigate risks based on factors like feasibility and readiness,
potential unintended burden  
on health care providers, and the need to focus on priority clinical use
cases. ONC is in the  
process of conducting research and analysis to determine what
evidence-based use cases should  
be supported and what standards are available to support such use cases.
We are also considering  
the overall maturity of technology adoption within the market to support
identified standards and  
the use of certified EHRs and clinical data registries for these
identified use cases in the near  
term, as well as identifying glide paths for the potential future
development of enterprise  
solutions.  
In the 2015 Edition final rule, we included certification criteria and
standards that are  
applicable for specific use cases for bidirectional exchange such as
Immunization Information  
Systems. In this proposed rule, we have proposed processes for updating
standards as well as  
new policies related to real world testing that would help ensure that
functionalities are  
implemented in a manner that is technically feasible in a practice
setting. In addition, we have  
worked with federal partners to advance health IT policies related to
bidirectional exchange with

registries in a manner that supports and reflects the current market
place while encouraging  
innovation and increased adoption. For example, we have worked with CMS
to enhance  
guidance for QCDRs under the MIPS to support health IT innovation and
partnership with health  
IT organizations. We are also working with the CDC and states to support
enhancements to  
PDMP integration as a priority use case for standards-based health IT
solutions. We believe  
these efforts can help to address the near term need to support high
priority use cases for  
bidirectional exchange between health care providers and registries.  
  
In this proposed rule, we propose to adopt new standards and
capabilities for certified  
APIs that have the potential to change how certain types of information
exchange are done,  
including the potential to exchange information with clinical data and
public health registries. In  
this request for information (RFI), we are seeking information on how
health IT solutions and the  
proposals throughout this rule can aid bidirectional exchange with
registries for a wide range  
public health, quality reporting, and clinical quality improvement
initiatives. For example, in  
December of 2018, in the “Strategy on Reducing Regulatory and
Administrative Burden  
Relating to the Use of Health IT and EHRs” draft report, we noted that
HL7 was working on an  
update to the FHIR standard to support API access to request data on
populations of patients,  
which could potentially address additional use cases, including
supporting payer needs, public  
health and quality improvement efforts, and health research
organizations. As discussed in  
section VII.4, FHIR Release 4 has now been published85 and updated
associated implementation  
specifications are expected to follow. FHIR Release 4 has several key
improvements, including  
certain foundational aspects in the standard and “FHIR resources”
designated as “normative” for  
the first time. This will lead to a cycle of more mature US FHIR Core
profiles aligned with

Release 4 and additional implementation guidance that explicitly
specifies how to handle  
populations of patient data (batch exports) via FHIR to more efficiently
enable population and  
learning health system-oriented services.  
We seek comment on use cases where an API using FHIR Release 4 might
support  
improved exchange between a provider and a registry. Specifically, we
seek comment on how  
the use of this standard might:  
• Reduce the burden of implementing multiple solutions for various types
of exchange,  
while still supporting the variability needed to exchange information
with registries  
devoted to the care of a population defined by a particular disease,
condition, exposure,

• Support an overall approach to data quality, including the systematic
collection of clinical

procedures to verify the  
completeness and validity of those data;  
• Improve and enhance the ability of providers to leverage feedback from
a registry to

**X. Patient Matching Request for Information  
**  
Patient matching is a critical component to interoperability and the
nation’s health  
information technology infrastructure. Accurate patient matching helps
health care providers  
access and share the right information on the right patient when and
where it is needed.  
Inaccurate patient matching can compromise safety, privacy, and lead to
increased health care  
costs, as acknowledged in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and  
Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Bill,
2017[137](ONCs.html#506):  
The Committee is aware that one of the most significant challenges
inhibiting the  
safe and secure electronic exchange of health information is the lack of
a  
consistent patient data matching strategy. With the passage of the
HITECH Act, a  
clear mandate was placed on the Nation’s healthcare community to adopt  
electronic health records and health exchange capability. Although the
Committee  
continues to carry a prohibition against HHS using funds to promulgate
or adopt  
any final standard providing for the assignment of a unique health
identifier for an  
individual until such activity is authorized, the Committee notes that
this  
limitation does not prohibit HHS from examining the issues around
patient  
matching. Accordingly, the Committee encourages the Secretary, acting
through  
the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
and  
CMS, to provide technical assistance to private-sector led initiatives
to develop a  
coordinated national strategy that will promote patient safety by
accurately  
identifying patients to their health information.  
  
Similarly, the Fiscal Year 2018 Appropriations
Bill[138](ONCs.html#506)also included language regarding  
patient matching.  
The Committee is aware that a challenge inhibiting the safe and secure
electronic  
exchange of health information is the lack of a consistent approach to
matching patient  
data. The Committee encourages ONC to engage with stakeholders on
private-sector led  
initiatives to develop a coordinated strategy that will promote patient
safety by accurately  
identifying patients to their health information.

Section 4007 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) directs the
Government  
Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study on patient matching.
Specifically, the GAO was  
charged to review the policies and activities of the Office of the
National Coordinator for Health  
Information Technology (ONC) and other relevant stakeholders, including
standards  
development organizations, developers, providers, suppliers, payers,
quality organizations,  
States, health information technology policy and technical experts, and
other appropriate entities.  
The GAO report, *Approaches and Challenges to Electronically Matching
Patients’ Records*  
*across Providers*, was released in January 2019.[139](ONCs.html#507) In
this report, GAO describes (1)  
stakeholders’ patient record matching approaches and related challenges;
and (2) efforts to  
improve patient record matching identified by stakeholders. Stakeholders
said more could be  
done to improve patient record matching, and identified several efforts
that could improve  
matching. For example, some said that implementing common standards for
recording  
demographic data; sharing best practices and other resources; and
developing a public-private  
collaboration effort could each improve matching. Stakeholders’ views
varied on the roles ONC  
and others should play in these efforts and the extent to which the
efforts would improve  
matching. Multiple stakeholders emphasized that no single effort would
solve the challenge of  
patient record matching.  
Patient matching may be defined as the linking of one patient’s data
within and across  
health care providers in order to obtain a comprehensive and
longitudinal view of that patient’s  
health care. At a minimum, this is accomplished by linking multiple
demographic data fields

such as name, birth date, sex, phone number, and address. For this
reason, accurate and  
standardized data capture and exchange and optimized algorithm
performance are critical  
components to the accurate patient matching. With this in mind, ONC has
taken several steps to  
better understand the patient matching landscape and to identify areas
where ONC can assist in  
standards and technical development, coordination, and innovation. For
example, in 2017, ONC  
launched the Patient Matching Algorithm Challenge, where six winners
were awarded total prize  
winnings of $75,000.[140](ONCs.html#508) The goals of this challenge
were to bring about greater transparency and  
data on the performance of existing patient matching algorithms, spur
the adoption of  
performance metrics for patient matching algorithm developers, and
positively impact other  
aspects of patient matching such as deduplication and linking. In
addition, in 2018, ONC  
showcased innovative technical and non-technical approaches to matching
through hosting a  
patient matching track at ONC’s Second Interoperability
Forum.[141](ONCs.html#508)  
In this Request for Information (RFI), we seek comment on additional
opportunities that  
may exist in the patient matching space and ways that ONC can lead and
contribute to  
coordination efforts with respect to patient matching. ONC and CMS
collaborated to jointly issue  
complementary requests for information regarding patient matching. ONC
is particularly  
interested in ways that patient matching can facilitate improved patient
safety, better care  
coordination, and advanced interoperability. Inaccurate patient matching
can lead to  
inappropriate and unnecessary care; unnecessary burden on both patients
and providers to correct  
misidentification, time consuming and expensive burden on health systems
to detect
and

Executives, one in  
five providers named lack of an appropriate patient matching strategy as
the primary reason for  
inadvertent illness or injury[142. W](ONCs.html#509)e consider this a
quality of care and patient safety issue and  
seek stakeholder input on creative, innovative, and effective approaches
to patient matching  
within and across providers. We also intend to review the responses to
this RFI in concert with  
the GAO report once published.  
We specifically seek input on the following:  
• It is a common misconception that technology alone can solve the
problem of poor data  
quality, but even the most advanced, innovative technical approaches are
unable to  
overcome data quality issues. Thus, we seek input on the potential
effect that data  
collection standards may have on the quality of health data that is
captured and stored and  
the impact that such standards may have on accurate patient matching. We
also seek  
input on other solutions that may increase the likelihood of accurate
data capture,  
including the implementation of technology that supports the
verification and  
authentication of certain demographic data elements such as mailing
address, as well as  
other efforts that support ongoing data quality improvement efforts.  
• In concert with the GAO study referenced above, we seek input on what
additional data  
elements could be defined to assist in patient matching as well as input
on a required  
minimum set of elements that need to be collected and exchanged. We
encourage

the standards and  
implementation specifications outlined. Public comments and subject
matter feedback on  
all sections of the Interoperability Standards Advisory are accepted
year round.  
• Also in alignment with the GAO study, we seek input on whether and
what requirements  
for electronic health records could be established to assure data used
for patient matching  
is collected accurately and completely for every patient. For instance,
the adopted 2015  
Edition “transitions of care” certification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1))
currently includes  
patient matching requirements for first name, last name, previous name,
middle name,  
suffix, date of birth, address, phone number, and sex. These requirement
also include  
format constraints for some of the data.  
• There are unique matching issues related to pediatrics and we seek
comment on  
innovative and effective technical or non-technical approaches that
could support  
accurate pediatric record matching.  
• Recent research suggests that involving patients in patient matching
may be a viable and  
effective solution to increase the accuracy of matching, and giving
patients access to their  
own clinical information empowers engagements and improved health
outcomes. We  
seek comment on potential solutions that include patients through a
variety of methods  
and technical platforms in the capture, update and maintenance of their
own demographic  
and health data, including privacy criteria and the role of providers as
educators and  
advocates.

• In addition, we seek input on standardized metrics for the performance
evaluation of  
available patient matching algorithms. Health IT developers are each
relying on a number  
of patient matching algorithms, however, without the adoption of agreed
upon metrics for  
the evaluation of algorithm performance across the industry, existing
matching  
approaches cannot be accurately evaluated or compared across systems or
over time.  
• At the same time, we seek input on transparent patient matching
indicators such as  
database duplicate rate, duplicate creation rate, and true match rate,
for example, that are  
necessary for assessment and reporting. The current lack of consensus,
adoption, and  
transparency of such indicators makes communication, reporting, and
cross-provider or  
cross-organizational comparisons impossible, impedes a full and accurate
assessment of  
the extent of the problem, prohibits informed decision making, limits
research on  
complementary matching methods, and inhibits progress and innovation in
this area.  
• There are a number of emerging private-sector led approaches in
patient matching that  
may prove to be effective, and we seek input on these approaches, in
general. A number  
of matching services that leverage referential matching technology have
emerged in the  
market recently, yet evaluations of this type of approach has either not
been conducted or  
has not been made public. Other innovative technical approaches such as
biometrics,  
machine learning and artificial intelligence, or locally developed
unique identifier efforts,  
when used in combination with non-technical approaches such as patient
engagement,  
supportive policies, data governance, and ongoing data quality
improvement efforts may  
enhance capacity for matching.

incorporate by reference  
in the **Code of Federal Regulations** (79 FR 66267; 1 CFR 51.5(a)).
Specifically, § 51.5(a)  
requires agencies to discuss, in the preamble of a proposed rule, the
ways that the materials it  
proposes to incorporate by reference are reasonably available to
interested parties or how it  
worked to make those materials reasonably available to interested
parties; and summarize, in the  
preamble of the proposed rule, the material it proposes to incorporate
by reference.  
To make the materials we intend to incorporate by reference reasonably
available, we  
provide a uniform resource locator (URL) for the standards and
implementation specifications.  
In many cases, these standards and implementation specifications are
directly accessible through  
the URLs provided. In most of these instances, access to the standard or
implementation  
specification can be gained through no-cost (monetary) participation,
subscription, or  
membership with the applicable standards developing organization (SDO)
or custodial  
organization. Alternatively, a copy of the standards may be viewed for

to implement support for Unique Device Identifiers (UDIs) for
implantable medical devices. The  
IG identifies changes needed to the C-CDA to better facilitate the
exchange of the individual  
UDI components in the health care system when devices are implanted in a
patient. The UDI  
components include the Device Identifier (DI) and the following
individual production  
identifiers (PI): the lot or batch number, serial number, manufacturing
date, expiration date, and  
distinct identification code.

Summary: SMART on FHIR provides reliable, secure authorization for a
variety of app  
architectures through the use of the OAuth 2.0 standard. This
Authorization Guide supports the  
four uses cases defined for Phase 1 of the Argonaut Project. This
profile is intended to be used  
by developers of apps that need to access FHIR resources by requesting
access tokens from  
OAuth 2.0 compliant authorization servers. The profile defines a method
through which an app  
requests authorization to access a FHIR resource, and then uses that
authorization to retrieve the  
resource. Other Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA)-mandated security  
mechanisms, such as end-user authentication, session time-out, security
auditing, and accounting  
of disclosures, are outside the scope of this profile.

Summary: This specification defines mechanisms for dynamically
registering OAuth 2.0 clients  
with authorization servers. Registration requests send a set of desired
client metadata values to  
the authorization server. The resulting registration responses return a
client identifier to use at the  
authorization server and the client metadata values registered for the
client. The client can then  
use this registration information to communicate with the authorization
server using the OAuth  
2.0 protocol. This specification also defines a set of common client
metadata fields and values  
for clients to use during registration.

Summary: OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the
OAuth 2.0 protocol. It  
enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the
authentication performed by  
an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information
about the End-User in an  
interoperable and REST-like manner. This specification defines the core
OpenID Connect  
functionality: authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and the use of
Claims to communicate  
information about the End-User. It also describes the security and
privacy considerations for  
using OpenID Connect.  
**XII. Response to Comments**  
Because of the large number of public comments normally received in
response to  
**Federal Register** documents, we are not able to acknowledge or
respond to them individually.  
We will consider all comments we receive by the date and time specified
in the **DATES** section  
of this preamble, and, when we proceed with a subsequent document, we
will respond to the  
comments in the preamble of that document.  
We note that, throughout this proposed rule, we identified areas where
we need more  
information before making a proposal (i.e., requests for information).
We note that comments we  
receive in response to these requests for information will not
necessarily be addressed in the final  
rule, but will be used to inform future rulemaking.  
**XIII. Collection of Information Requirements**  
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) requires agencies to provide a
60-day  
notice in the **Federal Register** and solicit public comment on a
proposed collection of  
information before it is submitted to the Office of Management and
Budget for review and  
approval. In order to fairly evaluate whether an information collection
should be approved by the

<span id="523"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **523** of **724**  
  
OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA requires that we solicit comment
on the following  
issues:  
1\. Whether the information collection is necessary and useful to carry
out the proper  
functions of the agency;  
2\. The accuracy of the agency’s estimate of the information collection
burden;  
3\. The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be
collected; and  
4\. Recommendations to minimize the information collection burden on the
affected  
public, including automated collection techniques.  
Under the PRA, the time, effort, and financial resources necessary to
meet the  
information collection requirements referenced in this section are to be
considered. We explicitly  
seek, and will consider, public comment on our assumptions as they
relate to the PRA  
requirements summarized in this section. To comment on the collection of
information or to  
obtain copies of the supporting statements and any related forms for the
proposed paperwork  
collections referenced in this section, email your comment or request,
including your address and  
phone number to Sherrette.funn@hhs.gov, or call the Reports Clearance
Office at (202) 690–

collections must be  
directed to the OS Paperwork Clearance Officer at the above email
address within 60 days.  
*A. ONC-ACBs*  
We propose to add new ONC-ACB collection and reporting requirements for
the  
certification of health IT to the 2015 Edition (and any subsequent
edition certification) in §  
170.523(p), (q), (t), and § 170.550(1).

<span id="524"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **524** of **724**  
  
As proposed for §§ 170.550(l), ONC-ACBs would not be able to certify
health IT until  
they review and verify health IT developers’ attestations confirming
that the developers are  
compliant with Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements.
ONC-ACBs would  
also submit the health IT developer attestations to ONC as proposed by §
170.523(q). We believe  
this will require minimal effort on behalf of ONC-ACBs as the ONC
submission part will be  
electronically facilitated via the CHPL.  
As proposed for § 170.523(p)(3), ONC-ACBs would be required to collect
and report  
certain information to ONC related to real world testing plans and
results. ONC-ACBs would be  
required to verify that the health IT developer submits an annual,
publicly available real world  
testing plan and perform a completeness check for both real world
testing plans and results. We  
believe ONC-ACBs will face minimum burden in complying with these new
proposed  
requirements.  
As proposed for § 170.523(t), ONC-ACBs would ensure health IT developers
opting to  
take advantage of the Standard Version Advancement Process flexibility
per § 170.405(b)(5)  
provide timely advance written notice to the ONC-ACB and all affected
customers. ONC-ACBs  
would maintain a record of the date of issuance and the content of
developers’ notices, and  
timely post content of each notice received publicly on the CHPL
attributed to the certified  
Health IT Module(s) to which it applies. We believe this will require
minimal effort on behalf of  
ONC-ACBs as the submission part will be electronically facilitated via
the CHPL.  
In the 2015 Edition proposed rule (80 FR 16894), we estimated fewer than
ten annual  
respondents for all of the regulatory “collection of information”
requirements that applied to the  
ONC-AA and ONC-ACBs, including those previously approved by OMB. In the
2015 Edition

final rule (80 FR 62733), we concluded that the regulatory “collection
of information”  
requirements for the ONC-AA and the ONC-ACBs were not subject to the PRA
under 5 CFR  
1320.3(c). We continue to estimate less than ten annual respondents for
all of the proposed  
regulatory “collection of information” requirements for ONC-ACBs under
Part 170 of Title 45,  
including those previously approved by OMB and proposed in this proposed
rule. Accordingly,  
the regulatory “collection of information” requirements under the
Program described in this  
section are not subject to the PRA under 5 CFR 1320.3(c). We welcome
comments on these  
conclusions and the supporting rationale on which they are based. For
costs estimates of these  
proposed new regulatory requirements, we refer readers to section XIV.
(*Regulatory Impact*  
*Analysis*) of this proposed rule.  
*B. Health IT Developers*  
  
We propose in 45 CFR 170.580(a)(2)(iii) that ONC may take action against
a health IT  
developer for failure to comply with Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification requirements.  
We proposed to generally use the same processes previously codified in
regulation (§§ 170.580  
and 170.581) to take administrative enforcement action. These processes
would require health IT  
developers to submit information to ONC to facilitate and conclude its
review. The PRA,  
however, exempts these information collections. Specifically, 44 U.S.C.
3518(c)(1)(B)(ii)  
excludes collection activities during the conduct of administrative
actions or investigations  
involving the agency against specific individuals or entities.  
We propose in 45 CFR 170.402(b)(1) that a health IT developer must, for
a period of 10  
years beginning from the date each of a developer’s health IT is first
certified under the ONC  
Health IT Certification Program, retain all records and information
necessary to demonstrate

initial and ongoing compliance with the requirements of the ONC Health

**XIV. Regulatory Impact Analysis  
**  
*A. Statement of Need*  
This proposed rule is necessary to meet our statutory responsibilities
under the 21st  
Century Cures Act (Cures Act) and to advance HHS policy goals to promote
interoperability and  
mitigate burden for stakeholders. Proposals that could result in
monetary costs for stakeholders  
include the: (1) proposals to update the 2015 Edition health IT
certification criteria; (2) proposals  
related to Conditions and Maintenance of Certification for a health IT
developer; (3) proposals  
related to oversight for the Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification; and (4) proposals  
related to information blocking.  
While much of the costs of this proposed rule will fall on health IT
developers that seek  
to certify health IT under the ONC Health IT Certification Program
(Program), we believe the  
implementation and use of health IT certified to the 2015 Edition
(including the new criteria in

this proposed rule), compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification, and the  
limited exceptions to information blocking proposed would ultimately
result in significant  
benefits for health care providers and patients. We outline some of
these benefits below. We  
emphasize in this regulatory impact analysis (RIA) that we believe this
proposed rule would  
create opportunities for new market entrants and would remove barriers
to interoperability and  
electronic health information exchange, which would greatly benefit
health care providers and  
patients.  
We note in this RIA that there were instances in which we had difficulty
quantifying  
certain benefits due to a lack of applicable studies and/or data.
However, in such instances, we  
highlight the significant qualitative benefits of our proposals to
advance an interoperable health  
system that empowers individuals to use their electronic health
information (EHI) to the fullest  
extent and enables health care providers and communities to deliver
smarter, safer, and more  
efficient care.  
*B. Alternatives Considered*  
We assessed whether there are alternatives to our proposals,
specifically our proposals  
concerning EHI export, application programming interfaces (APIs), and
real world testing. We  
have been unable to identify alternatives that would appropriately
implement our responsibilities  
under the Cures Act and support interoperability. We believe our
proposals take the necessary  
steps to fulfill the mandates specified in the Public Health Service Act
(PHSA), as amended by  
the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
(HITECH) Act and the  
Cures Act, in the least burdensome way. We are, however, open to less
burdensome alternatives

that meet statutory requirements and our goals. Accordingly, we welcome
comments on our  
assessment and any alternatives we should consider.  
*C. Overall Impact*  
We have examined the impact of this proposed rule as required by
Executive Order  
12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993), Executive
Order 13563 on  
Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (February 2, 2011), Executive
Order 13771 on  
Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.  
601 *et seq.*), section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995
(2 U.S.C. 1532), and  
Executive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999).  
1\. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 – Regulatory Planning and Review
Analysis  
Executive Orders 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review and 13563 on
Improving  
Regulation and Regulatory Review direct agencies to assess all costs and
benefits of available  
regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select
regulatory approaches that  
maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental,
public health and safety  
effects, distributive impacts, and equity). A regulatory impact analysis
(RIA) must be prepared  
for major rules with economically significant effects ($100 million or
more in any one year).  
OMB has determined that this proposed rule is an economically
significant rule as the potential  
costs associated with this proposed rule could be greater than $100
million per year.  
Accordingly, we have prepared an RIA that to the best of our ability
presents the costs and  
benefits of this proposed rule.

Executive Order 13771 on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory
Costs was  
issued on January 30, 2017 and directs agencies to repeal two existing
regulations for each new  
regulation issued in fiscal year (FY) 2017 and thereafter. It further
directs agencies, via guidance  
issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), that the total
incremental costs of all  
regulations should be no greater than zero in FY 2018. The analysis
required by Executive Order  
13771, as supplemented by Executive Order 13777, adds additional
requirements for analysis of  
regulatory actions. The new requirements under Executive Orders 13771
and 13777 do not  
change or reduce existing requirements under Executive Orders 12866 or
13563.  
a. Costs and Benefits  
We have estimated the potential monetary costs and benefits of this
proposed rule for  
health IT developers, health care providers, patients, ONC-Authorized
Certification Bodies  
(ONC-ACBs), ONC-Authorized Testing Laboratories (ONC-ATLs), and the
federal government  
(i.e., ONC), and have broken those costs and benefits out into the
following categories: (1)  
deregulatory actions (no associated costs); (2) updates the 2015 Edition
Health IT certification  
criteria; (3) Conditions and Maintenance of Certification for a health
IT developer; (4) oversight  
for the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification; and (5) information
blocking.  
  
In accordance with Executive Order 12866, we have included the RIA
summary table as  
Table 29. In addition, we have included a summary to meet the regulatory
reform analysis  
requirements under Executive Order 13771.  
  
We note that we have rounded all estimates to the nearest dollar and
that all estimates are  
expressed in 2016 dollars as it is the most recent data available to
address all cost and benefit  
estimates consistently. We also note that estimates presented in the
following “Employee

For proposals where research supported direct estimates of impact, we
estimated the  
benefits. For proposals where no such research was identified to be
available, we developed  
estimates based on a reasonable proxy.  
  
We note that interoperability can positively impact patient safety, care
coordination, and  
improve health care processes and health
outcomes.[144](ONCs.html#530)However, achieving interoperability is a  
function of a number of factors including the capability of the
technology used by health care  
providers. Therefore, to assess the benefits of our proposals, we must
first consider how to assess  
their respective effects on interoperability holding other factors
constant.  
  
For the purpose of this analysis, we used regression analysis to
calculate the impact of  
our real world testing and API proposals on interoperability. We assumed
that the real world  
testing and API proposals would collectively have the same impact on
interoperability as health  
IT certified to the 2014 Edition. Therefore, we estimated linear
probability models that identified  
the impact of 2014 Edition certified health IT on hospitals’
interoperability. [145](ONCs.html#530) We used data  
from the 2014 and 2015 American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey
Information  
Technology Supplement (IT Supplement), which consists of an analytic
sample of 4,866  
observations of non-federal acute care hospitals that responded to the
IT
Supplement.[146](ONCs.html#530)We

whether a hospital routinely sends, receives, and  
integrates summary of care records electronically outside of its system
and finds any health information  
electronically outside of its system.

controlled for additional factors such as participation in a health

organization, hospital characteristics, and urban/rural status. More
specifically, we used the  
following explanatory variables:  
Edition=1 if a hospital adopted 2014 Edition EHR, 0 otherwise  
RHIO=1 if a hospital participates in health information exchange
organization, 0  
otherwise  
Government=1 if a hospital is publically owned, 0 otherwise

We found a statistically significant marginal effect of using 2014
Edition certified health IT  
associated with a five percentage point increase in
interoperability.[147](ONCs.html#531)  
  
While we acknowledge that there might be shared benefits across
proposals, we have  
taken steps to ensure that the benefits attributed to each proposal is
unique to the proposal  
referenced. We assumed that this marginal effect is true for our
proposals and distributed the 5%  
benefit across our real world testing and API proposals at (.1-1%) to
(1-4%) respectively.  
Moreover, the number of providers impacted is proposal specific. Given
data limitations, we  
believe this approach allows us to estimate the benefits of our
proposals without double counting  
the impact each proposal might have on interoperability.

We have made employee assumptions about the level of expertise needed to
complete the  
proposed requirements in this section. For wage calculations for federal
employees and ONC-  
ACBs, we have correlated the employee’s expertise with the corresponding
grade and step of an  
employee classified under the General Schedule (GS) Federal Salary
Classification, relying on  
the associated employee hourly rates for the Washington, DC locality pay
area as published by  
the Office of Personnel Management for 2016.[148](ONCs.html#532)We have
assumed that overhead costs  
(including benefits) are equal to 100% of pre-tax wages. Therefore, we
have doubled the  
employee’s hourly wage to account for overhead costs. We have concluded
that a 100%  
expenditure on benefits is an appropriate estimate based on research
conducted by HHS.[149](ONCs.html#532)  
We have used Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data to calculate private
sector employee  
wage estimates (e.g., health IT developers, health care providers, HINs,
attorneys, etc.), as we  
believe BLS provides the most accurate and comprehensive wage data for
private sector  
positions. Just as with the General Schedule Federal Salary
Classification calculations, we have  
assumed that overhead costs (including benefits) are equal to 100% of
pre-tax wages.  
All wage estimates (GS and BLS) have been calculated in 2016 dollars
because OMB  
requested that agencies generate cost and benefit estimates in 2016
dollars under Executive  
Order 13771. If we were to represent wage estimates in 2017 dollars,
then costs and benefits,  
including net benefits, would increase by 4%. For our final rule, we
will consider using 2017 and  
even 2018 dollars, if available, for our cost and benefit estimates.  
We welcome comments on our methodology for estimating labor
costs.

*Quantifying the Estimated Number of Health IT Developers and
Products*  
  
In this section, we describe the methodology used to assess the
potential impact of new  
2015 Edition certification criteria on the availability of certified
products in the health IT market.  
This analysis is based on the number of certified health IT products
(i.e., Health IT Modules),  
product capability, and the number of health IT developers that left,
merged, and/or entered the  
health IT market between the establishment of the Program and
implementation of the 2011  
Edition and the implementation of the 2014
Edition.[150](ONCs.html#533)  
  
Market consolidation may occur as a result of a natural evolvement of a
new industry.[151](ONCs.html#533)  
We account for this factor in our analysis. In Table 7 below, we
quantify the extent to which the  
certified health IT market consolidated between the 2011 Edition and
2014 Edition. We found  
that the number of health IT developers certifying products between the
2011 Edition and 2014  
Edition decreased by 22.1% and the number of products available
decreased by 23.2%.

Not all products are certified to all of the edition’s certification
criteria available in the  
Program. Modular certification allows a health IT developer to present a
product for certification  
to a narrower scope of specific use cases, which may be impacted at
differing levels or may not  
be impacted by the proposals in this proposed rule. Therefore, we have
estimated the number of  
2015 Edition certified health IT products and health IT developers
impacted by each proposal  
using proxies from historical data. Using the rates identified in Table
7, we then applied our  
estimate for market consolidation to estimate the number 2015 Edition
certified health IT  
products and health IT developers that would be impacted by our policies
in this proposed rule.  
Specifically, to estimate the number of 2015 Edition products and health
IT developers in the  
market, we have assumed:  
1\. **Products capable of recording EHI will include new certification
criteria**. We assume  
that products capable of recording patient health data will be the types
of products most  
likely to be impacted by and include the new proposed certification
criteria.  
2\. **Products capable of recording EHI data available in 2015 equal the
number of products**  
**available in 2014**. In 2014, there were 710 products by 588
developers capable of recording  
EHI. Since the new criteria involve the access to and movement and
exchange of EHI, we  
used only products that record EHI as a basis for our estimates. We
believe the 2014 totals  
reflect a realistic estimate of the currently available products and
their developers that could  
include the new 2015 certification criteria.  
3\. **Market consolidation rates denoted in Table 7 hold constant.** We
assume that the rate of  
market consolidation for products (-23.2%) and health IT developers
(-22.1%) from the 2011  
Edition to the 2014 Edition holds constant for the 2015 Edition.

*Number of End Users that Might Be Impacted by ONC’s Proposed
Regulations*  
  
For the purpose of this analysis, the population of end users differs
according to the  
regulatory action proposed. In many cases, the end user population
impacted is the number of  
hospitals and health care providers that possess certified health IT.
Due to data limitations, our  
analysis regarding the number of hospitals and health care providers
impacted by the regulatory  
action is based on the number of hospitals and health care providers
that have historically  
participated in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) EHR
Incentive Programs.  
Although there are limitations to this approach, participants in the CMS
EHR Incentive Programs  
represent an adequate sample on which to base our
estimates.[152](ONCs.html#535) We estimate 439,187 health care  
providers[153](ONCs.html#535) in 95,470 clinical
practices[154](ONCs.html#535)and 4,519 hospitals[155](ONCs.html#535)
will be impacted.

(1) Deregulatory Actions  
*Costs*  
  
We do not expect costs to be associated with the deregulatory action
proposals.  
*Benefits*  
We expect the proposals for deregulatory actions to result in
significant benefits for  
health IT developers, providers, ONC-ACBs, ONC-ATLs, and ONC. These
expected benefits  
are detailed below.  
*1.1 Removal of the Randomized Surveillance Minimum Threshold
Requirements*  
**  
We have proposed to revise § 170.556(c) by revising the requirement that
ONC-ACBs  
*must* conduct in-the-field, randomized surveillance and in its place
specify that ONC-ACBs *may*  
conduct in-the-field, randomized surveillance. We have further proposed
to remove  
§ 170.556(c)(2), which specifies that ONC-ACBs must conduct randomized
surveillance for a  
minimum of 2% of certified health IT products per year. We have also
proposed to remove the  
requirement that ONC-ACBs make a good faith effort to complete
randomized surveillance and  
the circumstances permitted for exclusion from this requirement found in
§ 170.556(c)(5).  
  
These proposals would reduce burden on health care providers by reducing
their exposure  
to randomized in-the-field surveillance of their health IT products.
Health care providers  
expressed concern about the time commitment to support ONC-ACB
randomized surveillance of  
health IT products, particularly if no non-conformities with certified
health IT were found.  
Providers have generally stated that reactive surveillance (e.g.,
complaint-based surveillance) is a  
more logical and economical approach to surveillance of health IT
products implemented in a  
health care setting. The proposal in this proposed rule would provide
health IT developers more

time to focus on interoperability. It would also provide ONC-ACBs more
time to respond to  
reactive surveillance, including health care provider complaints about
certified health IT.  
In the 2015 Edition final rule, we did not independently estimate the
costs for randomized  
surveillance. Rather, we relied on prior regulatory cost estimates for
all surveillance actions. One  
of our ONC-ACBs charges a $3,000 annual fee per product for surveillance
due to the new  
randomized surveillance requirements and to help normalize their revenue
stream during down  
cycles between certification editions. Using this fee as a cost basis
and assuming it would apply  
to all certified health IT (as opposed to the market-adjusted universe
of health IT that is used in  
other calculations in this RIA), we estimate that our proposal to remove
the randomized  
surveillance “2% minimum threshold” requirements would result in cost
savings between $6.8  
and $13.7 million for all stakeholders. To arrive at this estimate, we
multiplied the $3000 annual  
fee per product for surveillance by the total number of products
certified to the 2014 Edition  
which was 4,559 products at the time ($3,000\*4,559=$13.7 million). We
anticipate the number  
of products certified for 2014 to decrease to a little as half of the
original count over time.  
Therefore, we estimated the low end to be half of the $13.7 million
(.5\*$13.7 million=$6.8  
million). This estimate is based on feedback we received from our
ONC-ATL and ONC-ACB  
stakeholders. ONC-ACBs performed randomized surveillance an average of
22 times the first  
year the requirement was in effect. The following year surveillance was
performed an average of  
2 times. We cannot predict how many randomized surveillance events the
ONC-ACBs will  
perform now that we are not enforcing the requirement. It will be
completely at the discretion of  
the ONC-ACBs.

We note that we considered other potential benefits that we were unable
to quantify. We  
considered that health care provider burden may decrease from the
elimination of the 2%  
minimum threshold requirements because a provider would previously aid
the ONC-ACB in  
software demonstrations. However, we acknowledge that in the long term
and moving forward,  
providers will likely be the party reporting more of the complaints that
could result in reactive  
surveillance. We also considered that an additional benefit of the
proposal would be reduced  
burden on ONC-ACBs. Feedback from ONC-ACBs indicates that having to meet
a set number  
of surveillance activities in 12 months can be quite burdensome,
especially when factoring in the  
active engagement necessary from provider participants. Last, we
considered the potential  
benefit to health IT developers in having more surveillance focused on
situations dealing with  
actual end-user concerns and/or difficulties. Health IT developers have
indicated that they  
benefit from such surveillance, as feedback about conformance and
capability can improve their  
products.  
  
We welcome comments on potential means, methods, and relevant
comparative studies  
and data that we could use to better quantify these benefits.  
*1.2 Removal of the 2014 Edition from the Code of Federal Regulations*  
  
We have proposed to remove the 2014 Edition certification criteria from
the Code of  
Federal Regulations, which would directly benefit health IT developers,
ONC-ACBs, ONC-  
ATLs, and ONC and indirectly benefit health care providers. When looking
at the cost savings  
for removing the 2014 Edition certification criteria, we considered the
current costs for  
maintaining those certifications and their surveillance (reactive), as
well as the maintenance and  
administrative costs associated with supporting customer use of
certified health IT for CMS EHR

Incentive Program participation. The estimates below consider ONC
analysis of the financial  
sustainability of ONC-ACBs and reflect data from as late as 2015.  
We estimate that health IT developers would realize monetary savings
from no longer  
supporting the 2014 Edition certification criteria due to a reduction in
activities related to  
maintaining certification and surveillance. We are aware that one of our
ONC-ACBs charges an  
inherited certified status (ICS) fee of $1,000. This fee has been
applied over the last calendar  
year. Over that time period, the number of new, unique 2014 Edition
products has been declining  
(24 products in the last calendar year, and no new products in the last
four months) compared to  
the number of ICS certifications (569). Just assuming the cost of
continued ICS certification,  
health IT developers would be paying approximately $569,000 each year to
keep their 2014  
Edition products up-to-date.  
We are not aware of comparable fees charged by ONC-ATLs; however, based
on our  
experience with the Program, we expect health IT developers would
realize similar cost savings  
associated with ONC-ATL maintenance of the testing component associated
with ICS. Thus, we  
estimate an additional $569,000 cost savings for health IT developers
due to the reduced testing  
requirements.  
  
A recent study conducted by ONC indicates that 2014 Edition ICS
certification is not  
profitable for ONC-ACBs, which is why one ONC-ACB charged an additional
$3,000 annual fee

the net income for ONC-  
ACBs dropped 99% from about $5,310,000 in 2014 to $67,000 due to a
decline in revenue from  
a drop in new 2014 Edition certified health IT products without a
significant drop in expenses.  
We do not have enough information to calculate what percentage of
ONC-ACB expenses are the

direct result of 2014 Edition certification maintenance; however, our
research indicates that it is  
significantly less profitable for ONC-ACBs to maintain 2014 Edition
certification criteria (e.g.,  
through ICS attestation and reactive surveillance) than to certify new
2014 Edition certified  
health IT products.  
  
We also attempted to identify a potential reduction in maintenance and
administrative  
costs as a result of removing 2014 Edition certification criteria. We
could not obtain data to  
conduct a full quantitative analysis specific to the reduction of health
IT developer and health  
care provider costs related to supporting and maintaining the 2014
Edition. We seek comment on  
methods to quantify potential costs for maintaining and supporting
products to previous editions.  
  
We did conduct a review of academic literature and qualitative analysis
regarding  
potential savings from no longer supporting the 2014 Edition. We looked
at data in IT industry  
systems as whole, which showed that upgrading outdated legacy systems
saves resources  
otherwise spent on maintaining compatibilities to multiple systems and
also increases quality and  
efficiency.[156](ONCs.html#540)Furthermore, as technology evolves, newer
software and products allow for  
smoother updates compared to their predecessors. Newer products provide
better security  
features that are able to address both new and existing issues. In
addition, older software has an  
increased risk of failure, which, in the health IT industry, increases
risk to patient safety.  
  
From the implementer’s perspective, the research indicates that
retaining legacy systems  
tends to inhibit scalability and growth for businesses. The perpetuity
of outdated legacy systems  
increases connection and system integration costs and limits the ability
to realize increased

efficiency through IT implementation. Newer products are developed to
current specifications  
and updated standards, which decreases barriers and marginal cost of
ancillary product  
implementation and increases the accessibility of data in ancillary
systems – including via  
mobile devices and the latest applications. Finally, office staff in a
health care setting would no  
longer need to be trained to accommodate differing data access needs or
workarounds required to  
integrate to the legacy product.[157](ONCs.html#541)  
The research also indicates that retaining legacy software would not be
beneficial or  
profitable to the health IT market. Prolonging backwards compatibility
of newer products to  
legacy systems encourages market fragmentation.[158](ONCs.html#541)
Limiting fragmentation encourages  
innovation and attracts more developers by reducing barriers and the
marginal cost of  
development to multiple platforms. Health IT stakeholders have expressed
that system  
fragmentation increases the cost to develop and maintain health IT
connectivity for data  
exchange and to integrate software supporting administrative and
clinical processes, as well as  
limiting the feasibility of developing products to support specialty
clinical care. This direct  
feedback suggests that fragmentation is having a negative impact on the
interoperability and  
usability of health IT systems for health care providers. We intend to
encourage the health IT  
market to keep progressing with a baseline expectation of
functionalities that evolve over time.  
This requires limiting fragmentation by no longer supporting outdated or
obsolete legacy  
software.[159](ONCs.html#541)

We also estimate that additional savings could be realized by reducing
regulatory  
complexity and burden caused by having two certification editions. For
example, in the 2015  
Edition final rule, we added new requirements, such as disclosure and
transparency  
requirements, that applied to all certified product editions. This
required significant effort by  
health IT developers and ONC-ACBs to execute the requirements, and both
groups found it  
challenging to complete the task in the original timeframe provided by
ONC. We have observed  
that the task of managing two different editions within different rules
increases complexity and  
burden for ONC staff, contractors, ONC-ACBs, CMS programs referencing
the certification  
criteria, and other stakeholders, as compared to our proposal to remove
the 2014 Edition  
certification criteria. However, we are unable to estimate these
benefits because we have no  
means for quantifying the benefits gained from only using the 2015
Edition. We welcome  
comments on potential means, methods, and relevant comparative studies
and data that we could  
use to quantify these benefits.  
  
We also expect that health care providers would benefit from this
proposal because such  
action would likely motivate health IT developers to certify health IT
products to the 2015  
Edition, thus enabling providers to use the most up-to-date and
supported systems to care for  
patients. The 2015 Edition certification criteria facilitates greater
interoperability for several  
clinical health information purposes and enables health information
exchange, including APIs,  
through new and enhanced certification criteria, standards, and
implementation specifications. The  
certification criteria also allow for updates to documents and data
standards and focus on the  
establishment of an interoperable health information infrastructure. We
welcome comments on

*1.3* *Removal of the ONC-Approved Accreditor from the ONC Health IT
Certification*  
**  
*Program*  
  
We expect ONC to realize monetary cost savings from the proposal to
remove the ONC-  
Approved Accreditor (ONC-AA) from the Program. We expect ONC to realize
costs savings  
from no longer: (1) developing and publishing a Federal Register Notice
and listserv; (2)  
monitoring the open application period and reviewing and making
decisions regarding  
applications; and (3) oversight and enforcement of the ONC-AA. We have
calculated the  
estimated annual cost savings for this proposal, taking into
consideration that the ONC-AA  
renewed its status every three years.  
  
The ONC-AA’s expertise is in the ISO/IEC 17065 standard. Therefore, to
effectively  
collaborate with the ONC-AA for Program activities, ONC allocates
resources for working with  
the ONC-AA and informing the ONC-AA of scheme requirements and
applicable policy  
interpretations, which we have and can provide directly to the ONC-ACBs.
The amount of ONC  
resources allocated depends on current Program activities and need. For
our calculations, we  
used the estimated hours for collaborating with and informing an ONC-AA
in 2017 (using 2016  
wage estimates). We estimate that ONC spent approximately 110 hours
collaborating with the  
ONC-AA in 2017, which includes (all at the GS-13, Step 1 level): annual
assessments; providing  
appropriate guidance; implementing new requirements and initiatives; and
consultations as  
necessary. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee
located in Washington,  
DC is approximately $88.30. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost
savings to be $3,238.

We estimate that ONC would commit approximately eight hours of staff
time to develop  
the Federal Register Notice, which would include approximately: four
hours for drafting and  
review by an analyst at the GS-13, Step 1 level; two hours for review
and analysis by senior  
certification staff at the GS-14, Step 1 level; and two hours for review
and submittal for  
publication by Immediate Office staff at the GS-15, Step 1 level. The
hourly wage with benefits  
for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately
$88.30. The hourly  
wage with benefits for a GS-14, Step 1 employee located in Washington,
DC is approximately  
$104.34. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-15, Step 1 employee
located in Washington,  
DC is approximately $122.74. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost
savings to be $269.  
Additionally, we estimate a cost of $477 to publish each page in the
Federal Register, which  
includes operational costs. The Federal Register Notice for ONC-AAs
requires, on average, one  
page in the Federal Register (every three years), so we estimate an
additional annual cost savings  
of $159.  
  
We estimate that ONC would commit approximately two hours of staff time
by an  
analyst at the GS-13, Step 1 level to draft, review, and publish the
listserv to announce the  
Federal Register Notice. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step
1 employee located in  
Washington, DC is approximately $88.30. Therefore, we estimate the
annual cost savings to be  
$59.  
  
We estimate that ONC would commit approximately 25 hours of staff time
to manage the  
open application process, review applications and reach application
decisions, which would  
include approximately: 20 hours by an analyst at the GS-13, Step 1
level; three hours by senior  
certification staff at the GS-14, Step 1 level; and two hours for review
and approval by

hourly wage with benefits for a GS-15, Step 1 employee located in

Taking all of these potential costs savings into consideration, we
estimate the overall  
annual costs savings for our proposal to remove the ONC-AA from the
Program to be $4,500.  
*1.4 Removal of Certain 2015 Edition Certification Criteria*  
  
In section III.B.4 of this proposed rule, we propose to remove the
following certification  
criteria from the 2015 Edition: § 170.315(b)(4) “Common Clinical Data
Set summary - create;”  
(b)(5) “Common Clinical Data Set summary – receive”, § 170.315(a)(10)
“Drug formulary and  
preferred drug list checks,” § 170.315(a)(11) “Smoking status,”§
170.315(a)(13) “Patient-  
specific education resources” and § 170.315(e)(2) “Secure messaging.”  
For determining calculations for the majority of the proposed removal of
certain 2015  
Edition certification criteria, we used the assumptions below. For the
proposed removal of §  
170.315(b)(4) Common Clinical Data Set summary – create and (b)(5)
Common Clinical Data  
Set summary – receive, we took a slightly different approach discussed
in section 1.4.1.  
  
In the 2015 Edition final rule, we estimated the costs for developing
and preparing health  
IT to meet the 2015 Edition certification criteria. The development and
preparation costs we  
estimated were derived through a health IT developer per criterion cost.
We estimated the  
development and preparation costs over a four-year period and we
projected the costs would be  
unevenly distributed. In figuring out the cost savings for the
deregulatory actions, we initially

used the distribution from the 2015 Edition, but then adjusted the
percentages of development  
and preparation costs due to current empirical and anecdotal evidence.
The distribution was  
reevaluated to account for 2019 and we estimate the actual development
and preparation  
distribution for 2018 to be 35% and for 2019 to be 15%. We took the
average development and  
preparation cost estimates (low and high) per criterion from Table 14 of
the 2015 Edition final  
rule (80 FR 62737). We then used our new distribution to figure out the
cost per year for years  
2018 and 2019. We took the total estimated costs for 2018 and 2019 and
divided that by 12 to  
determine the cost savings per month and took a range of 6-12 months.  
  
To determine the testing costs of the deregulatory actions, we took the
number of health  
IT developers who develop products for certification for the identified
criteria from the 2015  
Edition final rule and then figured out the average cost per criterion.
Based on the costs that one  
of the ONC-ATLs charges for testing, we estimated the average cost for
testing per criterion and  
determined subsequent cost savings. In 2017, only about five to ten
percent of products have  
been tested and certified compared to the number of certified 2014
Edition products. Therefore,  
up to 90 to 95 percent of products remain to be tested and certified to
the 2015 Edition.  
  
We estimate the total cost savings by multiplying the number of health
IT developers  
who developed products for certification to a certain criterion by the
estimated cost per criterion,  
$475. We then took five percent of that number to figure out the high
end for the cost savings.  
We then took 10 percent to figure out the low end. The five percent was
derived from looking at  
the number of unique developers who have at least one active 2014
Edition product and the  
number of unique developers who have at least one active 2015 Edition.
The denominator is the  
number of unique developers who have at least one active 2014 Edition
product, which is 793.

The numerator is the number of unique developers who have at least one
active 2015 Edition  
product and one active 2014 edition product, which is 41.
(41/793=0.0517024 or 5 percent).  
*1.4.1 Common Clinical Data Set Summary Record Criteria*  
  
We propose to remove the Common Clinical Data Set summary - create (§  
170.315(b)(4)) and Common Clinical Data Set summary - receive (§ 170.315
(b)(5)) criteria.  
  
We expect ONC to realize cost savings associated with internal
infrastructure support and  
maintenance, which would include actions such as (1) developing and
maintaining information  
regarding these criteria on the ONC website; (2) creating documents
related to these criteria and  
making those documents 508 compliant; (3) updating, revising, and
supporting Certification  
Companion Guides, test procedures, and test tools; and (4) responding to
inquiries concerning  
these criteria. Based on ONC data on the number of inquiries received
since early 2016, we  
estimate approximately 12 annual inquiries about § 170.315(b)(4) and (5)
respectively, (24 total  
inquiries for two criteria). We estimate it will take an analyst at the
GS-13, Step 1 level an  
average of two hours to conduct all tasks associated with each inquiry.
The hourly wage with  
benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is
approximately $88.30.  
Therefore, we estimate the annual cost savings to be $4,238.  
  
We do not expect cost savings associated with software maintenance
because both of  
these criteria incorporate the Common Clinical Data Set and essentially
the same data input and  
validation requirements as the transitions of care criterion (§
170.315(b)(1)). The removal of  
these two criteria would not affect the test data and software
maintenance costs, as the same test  
data and software validation elements remain in § 170.315(b)(1) and the
Common Clinical Data  
Set used in other criteria.

ONC-ACBs could realize minimal savings, as they would need to conduct
slightly less  
surveillance based on the two products that are currently certified to
these criteria. We expect  
these potential cost savings to be de minimis and have therefore not
estimated them.  
  
Taking all these potential costs savings into consideration, we estimate
the overall annual  
costs savings for our proposal to remove the Common Clinical Data Set
summary record  
certification criteria from the 2015 Edition to be $4,238. We welcome
comments on the above  
estimates and methods we could use to better quantify these benefits.  
  
  
*1.4.2 Drug Formulary and Preferred Drug List Checks*  
  
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “drug formulary and preferred drug
list checks”  
criterion in § 170.315(a)(10)). To calculate the cost savings for
removing this criterion, we used  
the 2015 Edition estimated costs for development and preparation for
this criterion which were  
between $15,750 and $31,500. We believe that 35% of developers would be
still newly  
certifying in 2018 and 15% in 2019 and applied the proportions
respectively. We estimated the  
cost of development and preparation costs to be between $5,512.50 and
$11,025 for 2018 and  
$2,362.50 and $4,725 for 2019. We calculated the cost per month for
years 2018 and 2019 and  
using the high point estimates, estimated the development and
preparation costs over a 6 to 12  
month period between August 2018 to August 2019 to be between $4,068.75
and $6,825.  
  
To calculate the cost for testing for this criterion, we multiplied the
5 developers that we  
estimated in the 2015 Edition to develop products to this criterion by
our estimated cost to test  
per criterion of $475. The estimated cost per criterion was based on
what one ONC-ATL charged  
for testing and averaged per criterion. To be conservative in our
calculations, we reduced the  
number by 10% and 5% respectively resulting in $2,137.50 and
$2,256.25.

Taking these estimated costs into account we expect cost savings to

Edition “drug formulary and preferred drug list checks” criterion to be
between $8,962.50 and  
$9,081.25.  
  
  
*1.4.3 Smoking Status*  
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “smoking status” criterion (§
170.315(a)(11)),  
which would include removing it from the 2015 Edition Base EHR
definition. To calculate the  
cost savings for removing this criterion, we used the 2015 Edition
estimated costs of developing  
and preparing the criterion to the 2015 Edition, between $15,750 and
$31,500 and estimated that  
35% of developers would be newly certified in 2018 and 15% in 2019. We
estimated the cost of  
development and preparation costs to be between $5,512.50 and $11,025
for 2018 and $2,362.50  
and $4,725 for 2019. We calculated the cost per month for years 2018 and
2019 and using the  
high point estimates, estimated the development and preparation costs
over a 6 to 12 month  
period between August 2018 and August 2019. We estimated the costs to be
between $4,068.75  
at 6 months and $6,825 at 12 months.  
To calculate the cost for testing for this criterion, 5 developers were
estimated in the 2015  
Edition to develop products to this criterion. We multiplied the 5
developers by our estimated  
cost to test per criterion of $475. This estimated cost per criterion
was based on what one ONC-  
ATL charged for testing and averaged per criterion. To be conservative,
we reduced the number  
by 10% and 5% respectively resulting in $2,137.50 and $2,256.25.

We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “patient-specific education
resources”  
certification criterion (§ 170.315(a)(13)). To estimate the cost of
removing this criterion, we used  
the 2015 Edition estimated costs for development and preparation which
is between $4,709,880  
and $6,279,840. We believe that 35% of developers would be still newly
certifying in 2018 and  
15% in 2019 and applied the proportions respectively. We estimated the
cost of development and  
preparation to be between $1,648,458 and $2,197,944 for 2018 and
$706,482 and $941,976 for  
2019\. We calculated the cost per month for years 2018 and 2019 and
using the high point  
estimates, estimated the development and preparation costs over a 6 to
12 month period, within  
August 2018 to August 2019. We estimated the costs to be between
$850,395 at 6 months and  
$1,360,632 at 12 months. To calculate the testing cost for this
criterion, we multiplied the  
estimates from the 2015 Edition of 249 developers that we estimated
would develop products to  
this criterion by our estimated cost to test per criterion of $475. The
estimated cost per criterion  
was based on what one ONC-ATL charged for testing and averaged per
criterion. To be  
conservative, we reduced the number by 10% and 5% respectively resulting
in $106,447.50 and  
$112,361.25. Taking these estimated costs into account, we expect the
cost savings of removing  
the 2015 Edition “Patient-specific education resources” criterion to be
between $1,467,079.50  
and $1,472,993.25.  
*1.4.5 Secure Messaging*  
We propose to remove the 2015 Edition “secure messaging” criterion (§
170.315(e)(2)).  
To estimate the cost savings of removing this criterion, we used the

Edition final rule for development and preparation costs which is

15% in 2019 and applied the proportions respectively. We estimated the
cost of development and  
preparation costs to be between $543,312 and $1,086,624 for 2018 and
$232,848 and $465,696  
for 2019. We then calculated the cost per month for years 2018 and 2019
and using the high  
point estimates, estimated the development and preparation costs over a
6 to 12 month period,  
between August 2018 to August 2019 to be between $401,016 at 6 months
and $672,672 at 12  
months. To calculate the cost for testing this criterion, we multiplied
the 246 developers that we  
estimated in the 2015 Edition would develop products to this criterion
by our estimated cost to  
test per criterion of $475. The estimated cost per criterion was based
on what one ONC-ATL  
charged for testing and averaged per criterion. To be conservative, we
reduced the number by  
10% and 5%, respectively, resulting in $105,165 and $111,007.50. Taking
these estimated costs  
into account, we estimate the cost savings of removing the 2015 Edition
“Secure messaging”  
criterion to be between $777,837 and $783,678.50.  
  
*1.5 Removal of Certain Certification Requirements*  
We propose to remove § 170.523(k)(1)(iii)(B), which requires ONC-ACBs to
ensure that  
certified health IT includes a detailed description of all known
material information concerning  
limitations that a user may encounter in the course of implementing and
using the certified health  
IT, whether to meet “meaningful use” objectives and measures or to
achieve any other use within  
the scope of the health IT's certification. We also propose to remove §
170.523(k)(1)(iv)(B) and  
(C), which state that the types of information required to be disclosed
include but are not limited  
to: (B) limitations, whether by contract or otherwise, on the use of any
capability to which  
technology is certified for any purpose within the scope of the
technology's certification; or in  
connection with any data generated in the course of using any capability
to which health IT is

certified; (C) Limitations, including but not limited to technical or
practical limitations of  
technology or its capabilities, that could prevent or impair the
successful implementation,  
configuration, customization, maintenance, support, or use of any
capabilities to which  
technology is certified; or that could prevent or limit the use,
exchange, or portability of any data  
generated in the course of using any capability to which technology is
certified.  
To calculate the savings related to removing these two disclosure
requirements, we  
estimated 830 products certified to the 2015 Edition. We did so by
applying the market  
consolidation rate of -23.2% which was the rate observed between 2011
and 2014 Editions.  
Assuming that an ONC-ACB spends 1 hour on average reviewing costs,
limitations and  
mandatory disclosures, we estimate the time saved by no longer having to
review the limitations  
to be two-thirds of an hour. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13,
Step 1 employee located  
in Washington, DC is approximately $88.30 and we assume this to be the
hourly rate for an  
ONC-ACB reviewer. We multiplied 830, the projected number of certified
products, by two-  
thirds of an hour and the assumed hourly rate and calculated the cost
savings to be $48,859.  
(2) Updates to the 2015 Edition Certification Criteria  
  
The following section details the costs and benefits for updates to the
2015 Edition health  
IT certification criteria, which includes (1) costs and benefits to
update certain 2015 Edition  
criteria to due to the adoption of the United States Core Data for
Interoperability (USCDI) as a  
standard and (2) costs for new 2015 Edition criteria for electronic
health information export,  
API, privacy and security, and Data Segmentation for Privacy (DS4P)-Send
and Data  
Segmentation for Privacy-Receive, and consent management for APIs.

In order to advance interoperability by ensuring compliance with new
structured data and  
code sets that support the data, we propose in this proposed rule to
remove the “Common  
Clinical Data Set” definition and its references from the 2015 Edition
and replace it with the  
“United States Core Data for Interoperability” (USCDI) standard, naming
Version 1 (v1) in §  
170.213 and incorporating it by reference in §170.299. The USCDI v1
establishes a minimum set  
of data classes (including structured data) that are required for health
IT to be interoperable  
nationwide and is designed to be expanded in an iterative and
predictable way over time.  
The USCDI v1 adds 2 new data classes, “Clinical Notes” and “Provenance”
that were not  
defined in the CCDS, which will require updates to the Consolidated
Clinical Document  
Architecture (C-CDA) standard and updates to the following certification
criteria: §  
170.315(b)(1) (transitions of care); (e)(1) (view, download, and
transmit to 3rd party); (g)(6)  
(Consolidated CDA creation performance); (f)(5) (transmission to public
health agencies –  
electronic case reporting); and (g)(9) (application access – all data
request). From our analysis of  
the C-CDA standard, we conclude that the requirements of “Provenance”
data class are already  
met by the existing C-CDA standard, and will not require any new
development. Therefore, we  
have estimated the proposed cost to health IT developers to add support
for “Clinical Notes” data  
class in C-CDA, and the necessary updates to the affected certification
criteria. These estimates  
are detailed in Table 9 below and are based on the following
assumptions:  
1\. **Health IT developers will use the same labor costs and data
models**. Table 9 shows the  
estimated labor costs per product for a health IT developer to develop
support for the  
additional USCDI data element in the C-CDA standard and affected
certification criteria. We

estimates in this section  
assume all health IT developers will incur the costs noted in Table 9.  
2\. **A proxy is needed to project the number of 2015 Edition certified
health IT products**. ****  
We estimate that 545 products from 458 developers will be affected by
our proposal. Our  
proxy is based on the number of 2014 Edition certified health IT
products that are capable of  
recording patient data.[160](ONCs.html#554)There were 710 products by
588 developers with at least one 2014  
Edition product capable of recording patient data. We then multiplied
these numbers by our  
certified health IT market consolidation estimates of -22.1% and -23.2%
to project the  
number of 2015 developers and products, respectively.  
3\. According to the May 2016 BLS occupational employment statistics,
the mean hourly wage  
for a “Software Developer” is $50.14.[161](ONCs.html#554)

assuming 545  
products, we estimate that the total annual cost to all health IT
developers would, on average,  
range from $103.8 million to $262.3 million. This would be a one-time
cost to developers per  
product that is certified to the specified certification criteria and
would not be perpetual.

We believe this proposal would benefit health care providers, patients,
and the industry as  
a whole. Clinical notes and provenance were included in the draft USCDI
v1 based on significant  
feedback from the industry, which highly regarded their desirability as
part of interoperable  
exchanges. The free text portion of the clinical notes was most often
relayed by clinicians as the  
data they sought, but were often missing during electronic health
information exchange.  
Similarly, the provenance of data was also referenced by stakeholders as
a fundamental need to  
improve the trustworthiness and reliability of the data being exchanged.
We expect  
improvements to interoperable exchange of information and data
provenance to significantly  
benefit providers and patients. However, we are not aware of an approach
for quantifying these  
benefits and welcome comments on potential approaches to quantifying
these benefits.  
*2.2 Electronic Health Information Export*  
  
We have proposed a new 2015 Edition certification criterion for
“electronic health  
information export” in **§** 170.315(b)(10). The intent of this
criterion is to provide patients and  
health IT users a means to efficiently export the entire electronic
record for a single patient or all  
patients in a computable, electronic format. Further, it would
facilitate the receiving health IT  
system’s interpretation and use of the EHI to the extent reasonably
practicable using the health  
IT developer’s existing technology. This outcome would promote exchange,
access, and use of  
electronic health information. It would also facilitate health care
providers’ ability to switch  
health IT systems or migrate electronic health information for use in
other technologies. This  
proposed criterion supports two specific use cases. First, it supports
the export for a single  
patient that would need to be enabled upon valid request from a user or
a patient. Second, the

EHI export functionality for all patients’ data would support a health
care provider or health  
system in switching health IT systems.  
*Costs*  
  
This section describes the estimated costs of the “electronic health
information export”  
certification criterion. The cost estimates are based on the following
assumptions:  
1\. **Health IT developers will use the same labor costs and data
models**. Table 10 shows the  
estimated labor costs per product for a health IT developer to develop
and maintain the  
electronic health information export functionality. We recognize that
health IT developer  
costs will vary; however, our estimates in this section assume all
health IT developers will  
incur the costs noted in Table 10.  
2\. **A proxy is needed to project the number of 2015 Edition certified
health IT products**  
**containing the “electronic health information export” certification
criterion**. **** We  
estimate that 545 products from 458 developers will contain the
“electronic health  
information export” criterion. To develop these estimates we first
identified a proxy for the  
number of health IT developers that may create a 2015 Edition certified
health IT product  
containing the “electronic health information export” criterion. Our
proxy is based on the  
number of 2014 Edition certified health IT products that are capable of
recording patient  
data.[162](ONCs.html#557)We based our estimates on these products
because data must be captured to be  
exported under the proposed criterion. There were 710 products by 588
developers with at  
least one 2014 Edition product capable of recording patient data. We
then multiplied these  
  
162 We defined “products capable of recording patient data” as any 2014
Edition product that was certified for at  
least one of the following criteria: Demographics ((a)(5)), Medication
List ((a)(7)), Medication Allergy List ((a)(8)),  
Problem List ((a)(6)), and Family Health History ((a)(12)).

There are a number of benefits to the electronic health information
export functionality.  
In our analysis, we have calculated the benefits in terms of the reduced
costs of the electronic  
health information export functionality compared to performing data
export without the  
electronic health information export functionality. The benefit
calculations below are based on  
the following assumptions: ****  
1\. **On average, 5% of providers and hospitals switch their health IT
annually**. Using CMS  
Medicare EHR Incentive Program data from years 2013-2016, we estimate
the rate of  
providers (hospitals and eligible professionals) that changed their
health IT developer. We  
believe that the electronic health information export functionality
would help alleviate the  
burden of switching between health IT systems by making data more
portable. Thus, the  
benefit calculations are based on assumptions regarding the number of
clinical practices (n =  
4,774) and hospitals (n = 226) that are projected to switch products in
a year.  
2\. **Health IT consultants[164](ONCs.html#560)** **will use the same
labor costs and data models**. Table 13 shows  
the estimated labor costs per product for a hospital or health care
provider to hire a health IT  
consultant to perform data export without the electronic health
information export  
functionality. We recognize that these costs will vary based on the size
of the hospital or  
clinical practice.  
3\. According to the May 2016 BLS occupational employment statistics,
the mean hourly wage  
for a “Software Developer” is $50.14.[165](ONCs.html#560)  
**Table 13: Cost per Provider to Perform Data Export without Electronic

We multiplied the costs to switch health IT by the estimated number of
hospitals and  
clinical practices affected. Thus the estimated annual benefit, in terms
of cost savings to hospitals  
and clinical practices would range from $240.7 million to $2.4 billion.
If we assume, based on  
our upper bound estimates above, that the total cost to health IT
developers is $174.9 million and  
that increased developer costs are passed to customers, then the net
benefit to hospitals and  
clinical practices would range from $65.8 million to $2.2 billion. The
midpoint of ranges stated  
is used as the primary estimate of costs and benefits.  
*2.3 Application Programming Interfaces*  
  
Our proposals regarding APIs in this proposed rule reflect the full
depth and scope of  
what we believe is necessary to implement the API Condition of
Certification. We propose to  
include new standards, new implementation specifications, and a new
certification criterion. Our  
proposal also includes a detailed Condition of Certification and
associated Maintenance of  
Certification requirements, as well as a proposal to modify the Base EHR
definition.  
*Costs*  
  
This section describes the potential costs of the API certification
criterion. The cost  
estimates below are based on the following assumptions:  
1\. **Health IT developers will use the same labor costs and data
models**. Table 16 shows the  
estimated labor costs per product for a health IT developer to develop
and maintain an API.  
We recognize that health IT developer costs will vary; however, we have
assumed in our  
calculations that all health IT developers will incur the costs noted in
Table 16.

2\. **A proxy is needed to project number of 2015 Edition certified
health IT products**  
**containing the API certification criterion.** We estimate that 459
products from 394  
developers will contain the API criterion. We used a proxy to determine
the number of health  
IT developers that may develop an API for the certification to the 2015
edition. There were  
598 products and 506 developers with at least one 2014 Edition certified
health IT product  
that could perform transitions of care. We then multiplied this number
by our certified health  
IT market consolidation estimates of -22.1% and -23.2% to project the
number of 2015  
developers and products, respectively. We believe this estimate serves
as a reasonable proxy  
for products capability of sending patient data. The 2015 Edition
required API functionality  
achieves a similar end by allowing providers to retrieve patient data
from secure data servers  
hosted by other developers, as well as providing patients access to
their medical records  
through third-party applications connected to these same secure
servers.

Based on the stated assumptions and costs outlined in Table 18, the
total estimated costs  
for health IT developers to develop and maintain a product to the API
criterion would range from  
$181.7 million to $414.0 million with an average cost per developer
ranging from $461,228 to  
$1,050,656. We note that the “other costs,” which account for $2.1
million to $10.7 million of  
this total are one-time costs and are not perpetual. The midpoint of
ranges stated is used as the  
primary estimate of costs and benefits.  
*Benefits*  
**  
The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) tasks ONC
with  
measuring interoperability in the health IT
industry.[167](ONCs.html#566)The measurement concepts developed  
include a multi-part approach analyzing not only adoption of health IT
functionalities supporting  
information exchange but the downstream impact of these technologies on
data completeness,  
data integration, and supports for core functions of patient care. The
benefits of our API proposal  
are similarly multifaceted. In the analysis below, we quantify benefits
in the following three  
areas: **  
• Reduction in provider burden associated with locating patient data;  
• Reduced costs related to reductions in duplicate lab tests,
readmissions, emergency room  
(ER) visits, and adverse drug events due to increased interoperability.
We focused on these  
outcomes for two reasons: (i) evidence in literature indicates that
health information  
exchange impacts the chosen measures; and (ii) cost of care associated
with these measures is

high and the impact of health information exchange is likely to result
in significant benefits  
in the form of cost reduction.  
• Increase in the number of individuals with access to their health
information.  
The benefit calculations are based on the following assumptions:  
1\. **Benefits noted in academic literature are assumed accurate**.
Estimates of the benefits are  
based on estimates obtained from peer reviewed academic literature. ONC
reviewed  
academic articles for validity; however, models were not replicated.  
2\. **Hospitals and eligible professionals that have participated in the
CMS EHR Incentive**  
**Programs will be impacted**: Estimates are based on the assumption
that 439,187 health care  
providers and/or 4,519 hospitals would be affected by this regulatory
action.  
3\. **Estimates on the impact of APIs on rates of interoperability (1%
to 4%) are based on**  
**ONC analysis**. To identify the impact of the API proposal on
interoperability, we used  
regression analysis. Specifically, we estimated linear probability
models that identified the  
impact of 2014 Edition certified EHR on hospitals’ interoperability
(whether a hospital  
sends, receives, finds, and integrates summary of care records). Using
data from the  
American Hospital Association (AHA) from years 2014 to 2015 in the
model, we controlled  
for hospital size, profit status, participation in a health information
organization, and state  
and year fixed effects. The marginal effect of using a 2014 Edition
certified health IT equated  
to a 5% increase in interoperability. This is an upper bound estimate.
For the purpose of this  
analysis, we assume that one to four percentage points would be a
reasonable range for API’s  
marginal impact on interoperability.

As noted previously, there might be shared benefits across certain
proposals and we have  
taken steps to ensure that the benefits attributed to each proposal are
unique to the proposal  
referenced. Specifically, we used regression analysis to calculate the
impact of our real world  
testing and API proposals on interoperability. We assumed that the
collective impact of real  
world testing and API proposals on interoperability would not exceed the
impact of 2014 Edition  
certified health IT. Therefore, we estimated linear probability models
that identified the impact  
of 2014 Edition certified health IT on hospitals’
interoperability.[168](ONCs.html#568) We controlled for additional  
factors such as participation in a health information exchange
organization, hospital  
characteristics, and urban/rural status. We found the marginal effect of
using 2014 Edition  
certified health IT was a five percentage point increase in
interoperability.  
  
While we acknowledge that there might be shared benefits across
proposals, we have  
taken steps to ensure that the benefits attributed to each proposal is
unique to the proposal  
referenced. We assumed that this marginal effect is true for our
proposals and distributed the 5%  
benefit across our real world testing and API proposals at (.1-1%) to
(1-4%) respectively.  
Moreover, the number of providers impacted is proposal specific. Given
data limitations, we  
believe this approach allows us to estimate the benefits of our
proposals without double counting  
the impact each proposal might have on interoperability.  
  
The first table below shows benefits of APIs for providers where we
monetize the impact  
of APIs as total amount saved by reducing provider time spent with the
health IT. Sinsky et al  
found physicians spend 27% of their total time on direct clinical face
time with patients, and

49.2% of their time on EHR and desk work.[169](ONCs.html#569) Outside
office hours, physicians spend another 1  
to 2 hours of personal time each night doing additional computer and
other clerical work. Based  
on this study, we assume that providers spend, on average, 6 hours per
day with their EHR (4  
hours of an 8 hour work day and 2 hours outside of office hours).
Despite the number of hours  
providers spend in their EHR, there is evidence that the introduction of
EHRs is associated with  
time saved. Amusan et al found that EHR and computerized provider order
entry (CPOE)  
implementation was associated with 3.69 minutes of time saved five
months post  
implementation.[170](ONCs.html#569)Additionally, Adler-Milstein et al
found that an increase in EHR use resulted  
in a 5.3% increase in work relative value units per clinician work
day.[171](ONCs.html#569) Using this evidence, we  
estimate the potential impact of APIs on providers’ time ranges from 1%
- 5%.[172](ONCs.html#569)  
Because the benefit of time saved is not limited to interoperable
exchange of health information  
among providers but includes additional benefits such as increased
patient knowledge, we used  
evidence from the literature to calculate the time saved benefit. Thus,
the impact of APIs on  
provider time is expected to represent a larger impact (5%) than the
impact of APIs on health  
outcomes (1%-4%) and cost. This is primarily because provider behavior
is more directly  
affected by this improvement.

approximately 1% of time saved. The upper  
bound estimate of 5% leverages Adler-Milstein’s estimate of a 5.3%

Based on the above calculations, we estimate the annual benefit to
health care providers  
for the use of the proposed API capabilities would, on average, range
from $651 million to $3.3  
billion. We estimate the annual benefit for patients and payers would,
on average, range from  
$278 million to million to $1.1 billion. Therefore, we estimate the
total annual benefit of APIs to,  
on average, range from $929 million to $4.4 billion. If we assume, based
on our cost estimates,  
an annual cost to health IT developers of $414 million and that
increased developer costs are  
passed to customers, then the net benefit to hospitals/providers would
range from $515 million to  
$3.3 billion. The midpoint of ranges stated is used as the primary
estimate of benefits.  
  
As we stated above, for table 19, we assume APIs provide both patients
and clinicians  
with increased access to EHI, which will have a direct impact on
physicians by making their  
work more efficient. Extrapolating the numbers from literature, we
assume this technology will

improve physicians’ time by 1%-5%. Also as stated above, for Table 20,
we assume APIs affect  
utilization through marginal improvements in interoperability. For this
reason, in addition to  
APIs, we needed to incorporate the impact of interoperability on each of
the outcomes. We  
request comment on these assumptions. Specifically, whether they are
appropriate and whether  
there are alternative assumptions or bases upon which we should make our
assumptions.  
  
We expect additional benefits from the use of APIs could be derived from
increased  
patient, and eventually payer, access to EHI. APIs make it easier for
patients to transmit data to  
and from different sources. According to the Health Information National
Trends Survey,[173](ONCs.html#572) half  
of Americans were offered access to an online medical record by a
provider or insurer in 2017.  
However, among those who were offered access, only 53% accessed their
record at least once  
within the last year, and only 3.6% of individuals who accessed their
record reported transmitting  
their data to a service or application. The proportion of individuals
accessing their online health  
information and transmitting their information to third parties is
expected to grow as APIs  
become more widespread and make more data available in a computable
format. Growing  
evidence suggests that patients who have access to their EHI are more
likely to adhere to medical  
orders including screening recommendations.[174](ONCs.html#572) Thus, we
expect such patients would ultimately  
realize improved health outcomes.  
  
In addition, the use of APIs to support the exchange and analysis of
payment related data  
(including price information) would improve cost transparency in the
market, increase the  
availability of valuable information for payers and patients, and likely
drive down health care

Survey 5, Cycle 1 (2017).

prices. For instance, a recent study by the Minnesota Department of
Health showed that the  
pricing for knee replacement surgery, which is a standard procedure in
many hospitals, can vary  
significantly across practices in the same locality. The Minnesota study
showed that Minnesota  
insurers paid as much as $47,000 for a patient's total knee replacement
and as little as $6,200 — a  
nearly eight-fold price difference. In addition to total knee
replacements, the study found that total hip  
replacement costs ranged from $6,700 to $44,000, a 6½-fold difference.
Typical vaginal baby delivery  
ranged from $2,900 to $12,300, while C-section deliveries ranged from
$4,700 to $22,800. Another  
study by Premier in conjunction with Wake Forest University Medical
Center found similar results.  
Among 350 hospitals, the average cost of primary knee implants was
$4,464. Yet, 50% of the  
hospitals paid between $4,066 and $5,609 on the devices. Further, the
same group of hospitals paid an  
average of $5,252 for primary hip implants, but 50% of the hospitals
paid between $4,759 and $6,463.  
The studies illustrated the secretive nature of pricing in the health
care market, as well as the extreme  
variations in price that can exist for the same procedure within the
same locality.[175, 176](ONCs.html#573) While this  
study was the first-ever local study of insurance company payments to
hospitals for those four  
common procedures, similar pricing variations have been well documented
in other, broader studies in  
recent years.[177](ONCs.html#573) We expect that making such price
information available to insurers through APIs

would drive health care prices down, which could lead to significant
benefits across the health care  
continuum.  
  
While the examples above emphasize procedures that tend to have defined
end points, the  
eventual population health queries would more broadly allow payers and
analytics firms working  
for employers to computationally examine the care providers render. Not
only is price  
transparency currently missing from the marketplace, but for most
inpatient care, the actual  
details of care are largely unobtainable through any APIs. However, we
are not aware of an  
approach for quantifying these types of benefits and welcome comments on
potential approaches  
to quantifying these benefits.  
*2.4 New Privacy and Security Certification Criteria*  
To be certified to the new privacy and security certification criteria,
encrypt  
authentication credentials (§ 170.315(d)(12)) and multi-factor
authentication (MFA) (§ 170.315  
(d)(13)), we are proposing to require health IT developers to assess
their Health IT Modules’  
capabilities and attest “yes” or “no” to the certification criteria. As
specified in section IV.C.3 of  
this proposed rule, we are proposing to make these certification
criteria applicable to all Health  
IT Modules under the Program. For encrypt authentication credentials and
multi-factor  
authentication, we are proposing to require a simple attestation. For
MFA, we are also proposing  
to require that if the health IT developer attests to supporting MFA,
the health IT developer  
would need to explain how it supports MFA. We also request public
comment on whether there  
is value in adopting an MFA criterion and whether the health IT
developer should explain how it  
supports MFA.  
*Costs*

Federal Register (OFR) for publication and

<span id="575"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **575** of **724**  
  
These criteria are not intended to place additional burden on health IT
developers as they  
do not require new development or implementation. Rather, a health IT
developer is only  
required to attest to whether they encrypt authentication credentials or
support MFA. We expect  
the costs associated with attesting to these criteria to be de minimis
because we do not expect  
additional forms to be required and expect minimal effort would be
required to complete the  
attestation. We welcome comments on these expectations. The midpoint of
ranges stated is used  
as the primary estimate of costs and benefits.  
*Benefits*  
As stated previously, we are not requiring health IT developers to
encrypt authentication  
credentials or support MFA. Instead, we are requiring they attest to
whether they support the  
certification criteria or not. By requiring an attestation, we are
promoting transparency, which  
might motivate some health IT developers that do not currently encrypt
authentication  
credentials or support MFA to do so. If health IT developers are
motivated by this criteria and  
ultimately do encrypt authentication credentials and/or support MFA, we
acknowledge that there  
would be costs to do so; however, we assume that the benefits would
substantially exceed the  
costs. Encrypting authentication credentials and adopting MFA would
reduce the likelihood that  
authentication credentials would be compromised and would eliminate an
unnecessary use of IT  
resources. Encrypting authentication credentials and adopting MFA could
directly reduce  
providers’ operating/support costs, which would reduce their
administrative and financial  
burden. Encrypting authentication credentials would also help decrease
costs and burden by  
reducing the number of password resets due to possible phishing or other
vulnerabilities.

According to Verizon’s 2017 Data Breach Investigations Report, 81% of
hacking-related  
breaches leveraged either stolen and/or weak
passwords.[178](ONCs.html#576)The Verizon report encourages  
customers to vary their passwords and use two-factor authentication.
Also, NIST Special  
Publication 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines, *Authentication and
Lifecycle Management*,[179](ONCs.html#576)  
recommends the use of and provides the requirements for using
multi-factor authenticators.  
Based on these reports and other anecdotal evidence, we believe
encrypting authentication  
credentials and supporting MFA are established best practices among
industry developers,  
including health IT developers. As described above, we propose to
require health IT developers  
to attest to whether they encrypt authentication credentials. We do not
have access to published  
literature that details how health IT developers are already encrypting
authentication credentials  
and supporting MFA industry-wide, but we believe the majority of health
IT developers, or  
around 80%, are taking such actions. We assume that building this
functionality is in the future  
project plans for the remaining 20% because, as noted previously,
adopting these capabilities is  
an industry best practice. Health IT developers that have not yet
adopted these capabilities are  
likely already making financial investments to get up to speed with
industry standards. We  
believe our proposal may motivate these health IT developers to speed
their implementation  
process, but we have not attributed a monetary estimate to this
potential benefit because our rule  
is not a direct cause of health IT developers adopting these
capabilities. By the time we release  
the final rule, many more, or perhaps all, health IT developers will
likely already be
encrypting

*2.5 Data Segmentation for Privacy-Send and Data Segmentation for
Privacy-Receive;*  
*and Consent Management for APIs*  
We propose to remove the current 2015 Edition Data Segmentation for
Privacy (DS4P)-  
send (§ 170.315(b)(7)) and DS4P-receive (§ 170.315(b)(8)) certification
criteria which apply the  
DS4P standard at the document level. We propose to replace these two
criteria with three new  
2015 Edition DS4P certification criteria (two for C-CDA and one for
FHIR) that would support a  
more granular approach to privacy tagging data for health information
exchange supported by  
either the C-CDA- or FHIR-based exchange standards. In place of the
removed 2015 Edition  
DS4P criteria, we propose to adopt new DS4P-send (§ 170.315(b)(12)) and
DS4P-receive  
(§ 170.315(b)(13)) criteria that would remain based on the C-CDA and the
HL7 DS4P standard.  
These criteria would include capabilities for applying the DS4P standard
at the document,  
section, and entry level. We also propose to adopt a third 2015 Edition
DS4P certification  
criterion “consent management for APIs” (§ 170.315(g)(11)) that requires
health IT to be capable  
of responding to requests for data through an API in accordance with the
Consent  
Implementation Guide. Our primary purpose for proposing to remove and
replace them, in lieu  
of proposing to revise them, is to provide clarity to stakeholders as to
the additional functionality  
enabled by health IT certified to the new criteria.  
*Costs*  
We anticipate this proposal could result in up-front costs to health IT
developers as this  
new criteria would require the health IT to support all three levels –
document, section, and entry

– as specified in the current DS4P standard. However, we note that these
criteria are not being  
required in any program at this time. As of the beginning of the third
quarter of the 2018 CY,  
only about 20 products (products with multiple certified versions were
counted once) were  
certified to the current 2015 Edition DS4P certification criteria. We
estimate that 10-15 products  
will implement the new DS4P criteria. Developers may need to perform
fairly extensive health  
IT upgrades to support the more complex and granular data tagging
requirements under these  
criteria. We anticipate developers will need approximately 1500-2500
hours to upgrade  
databases and/or other backend infrastructure to appropriately apply
security labels to data and/or  
develop access control capabilities. Moreover, developers will likely
incur costs to upgrade  
health IT to generate a security-labeled C-CDA conforming to the DS4P
standard. We estimate  
developers will need 400-600 hours per criterion to make these upgrades
on systems that had  
previously certified to the document-level DS4P criteria, or 720-1220
hours per criterion for  
systems that are implementing these criteria for the first time. We
believe this work would be  
performed by a “Software Developer.” According to the May 2016 BLS
occupational  
employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for software developer is
$50.14. As noted  
previously, we have assumed that overhead costs (including benefits) are
equal to 100% of pre-  
tax wages, so the hourly wage including overhead costs is $100.28.
Therefore, we estimate the  
total cost to developers could range from $2,306,440 to $7,430,748. We
note that this would be a  
one-time cost. The midpoint of ranges stated is used as the primary
estimate of costs and  
benefits.  
Additionally, our proposal supports the capability to respond to
requests for patient  
consent information through an API compatible with FHIR Release 3. In
order to meet the

“consent management for APIs” criteria, developers would demonstrate
compatibility with the  
standards framework used for the Consent Implementation Guide. We have
estimated costs  
associated with this aspect of our proposal using the following
assumptions:  
1\. We estimate developers will require 1,500-3,500 hours to upgrade
health IT to align with the  
FHIR STU3 data model and develop a STU3 compatible FHIR server.  
2\. As with the two DS4P criteria, we anticipate developers will need
approximately 1,500-2,500  
hours to upgrade databases and/or other backend infrastructure to
appropriately apply  
security labels to data and/or develop access control capabilities. We
expect that this would  
be a one-time cost.  
3\. Because certification to this criterion is voluntary and because
supporting this criterion  
requires implementation of a version of FHIR (STU3) that does not align
with the other API  
criterion in this rule (based on DSTU2), we estimate the number of
products that will support  
this criterion is approximately 5% of the total number of 2015 certified
products. We used a  
proxy to determine the number of health IT developers that may develop
an API for the 2015  
Edition. There were 598 products and 506 developers with at least one
2014 Edition certified  
product that could perform transitions of care. We then multiplied this
number by our  
certified health IT market consolidation estimates of -22.1% and -23.2%
to project the  
number of 2015 developers and products, respectively; we estimate that
459 products from  
394 developers will contain the API criterion. Therefore, we anticipate
23 products from 20  
developers will certify to the “consent management for APIs” criterion.
We believe this work  
would be performed by a “Software Developer.”

We believe this proposal involving standardized APIs, as well as the
voluntary nature of  
the proposal, would significantly mitigate health IT developer costs. We
also expect developers  
to see a return on their investment in developing and preparing their
health IT for these

certification criteria given the benefits to interoperable exchange. We
welcome comments on this  
analysis.  
We anticipate potential costs for ONC related to this proposal
associated with: (1)  
developing and maintaining information regarding these new criteria on
the ONC website; (2)  
creating documents related to these new criteria and making those
documents 508 compliant; (3)  
updating, revising, and supporting Certification Companion Guides, test
procedures, and test  
tools; and (4) responding to inquiries concerning these criteria. We
estimate an ONC analyst at  
the GS-13, Step 1 level staff would devote, on average, 200 hours to the
above tasks annually.  
The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in
Washington, DC is  
approximately $88.30. Therefore, we estimate the annual costs to be
$17,660.  
*Benefits*  
We believe leveraging the DS4P standard’s ability to allow for both
document level and  
more granular tagging would offer functionality that is more valuable to
providers and patients,  
especially given the complexities of the privacy landscape for multiple
care and specialty  
settings. We also believe this proposal would benefit providers,
patients, and ONC because it  
would support more complete records, contribute to patient safety, and
enhance care  
coordination. We believe this proposal could also reduce burden for
providers by enabling an  
automated option, rather relying on case-by-case manual redaction and
subsequent workarounds  
to transmit redacted documents. We emphasize that health care providers
already have processes  
and workflows to address their existing compliance obligations, which
could be made more  
efficient and cost effective through the use of health IT. We expect
these benefits for providers,  
patients, and ONC to be significant; however, we are unable to quantify
these benefits at this

benefits.  
(3) Conditions and Maintenance of Certification ****  
*3.1 Information Blocking*  
  
For a discussion of the costs and benefits of the exceptions to
information blocking  
proposed in this rule, please see section (5) of this RIA.  
**  
*3.2 Assurances*  
  
  
We are proposing that health IT developers must make certain assurances
as Conditions  
and Maintenance of Certification: (1) assurances regarding the
electronic health information  
export certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(10) and (2) assurances
regarding retaining records  
and information.  
*3.2.1 Electronic Health Information Export*  
We propose, as a Condition of Certification requirement, that a health
IT system that  
produces and electronically manages electronic health information must
be certified to the 2015  
Edition “electronic health information export” certification criterion
in § 170.315(b)(10).  
Further, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement, health IT
developers must comply with  
this proposed Condition of Certification requirement within 24 months of
a subsequent final  
rule’s effective date or at the time of certification if the health IT
developer never previously  
certified health IT to the 2015 Edition. As another Maintenance of
Certification requirement, we  
propose that health IT developers must provide all of their customers
with the functionality  
included in § 170.315(b)(10).  
****  
**NOTICE**

<span id="583"></span>RIN 0955-AA01 Page **583** of **724**  
  
For a detailed discussion of the costs and benefits of the assurances
regarding the  
electronic health information export certification criterion in §
170.315(b)(10), please see section  
2.2 of this RIA above. **  
*3.2.2 Records and Information Retention*  
  
We propose that, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement, a health
IT developer  
must, for a period of 10 years beginning from the date of certification,
retain all records and  
information necessary that demonstrate initial and ongoing compliance
with the requirements of  
the ONC Health IT Certification Program. In an effort to reduce
administrative burden, we also  
propose, that in situations where applicable certification criteria are
removed from the Code of  
Federal Regulations before the 10 years have expired, records must only
be kept for 3 years from  
the date of removal for those certification criteria and related Program
provisions unless that  
timeframe would exceed the overall 10-year retention period. This
“3-year from the date of  
removal” records retention period also aligns with the records retention
requirements for ONC-  
ACBs and ONC-ATLs under the Program.  
Currently, there are no existing regulatory requirements regarding
record and information  
retention by health IT developers. We expect the costs to developers to
retain the records and  
information described above to be mitigated due to the following
factors. First, we expect that  
health IT developers are already keeping the majority of their records
and information in an  
electronic format. Second, we expect that health IT developers already
have systems in place for  
retaining records and information. Last, we expect that some developers
may already be  
retaining records and information for extended periods of time due to
existing requirements of  
other programs, including for those programs their customers participate
in. For instance,

Medicaid managed care companies are required to keep records for ten
years from the effective  
date of a contract.  
  
We estimate that each health IT developer will, on average, spend two
hours each week  
to comply with our proposed record retention requirement. We expect that
a health IT  
developer’s office clerk could complete the record retention
responsibilities. According to the  
May 2016 BLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage
for an office clerk is  
$15.87.[180](ONCs.html#584) As noted previously, we have assumed that
overhead costs (including benefits) are  
equal to 100% of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage including overhead
costs is $31.74.  
Therefore, we estimate the annual cost per developer would, on average,
be $3,301 and the total  
annual cost for all health IT developers (458 health IT developers have
products certified to the  
2015 Edition that are capable of recording patient health data) would,
on average, be $1.5  
million. We note that this is a perpetual cost. We welcome comments on
these cost estimates.  
*3.3 Prohibition or Restriction of Communications Costs*  
  
Health IT developers would need to notify their customers about the
unenforceability of  
communications and contract provisions that violate this Condition of
Certification. Generally,  
health IT developers should already have mechanisms in place, whether
via online postings,  
email, mail, or phone, for alerting customers to changes in their
policies and procedures. Such  
alerts should be standard practice. However, we have estimated the
potential costs for health IT  
developers to draft the notice and mail the notice as appropriate. We
estimate that a health IT  
developer’s office clerk will commit (overall) approximately 40 hours to
drafting and mailing

notices when necessary. According to the May 2016 BLS occupational
employment statistics,  
the mean hourly wage for an office clerk is
$15.87.[181](ONCs.html#585)As noted previously, we have assumed that  
overhead costs (including benefits) are equal to 100% of pre-tax wages,
so the hourly wage  
including overhead costs is $31.74. Therefore, we estimate the annual
cost per developer to be  
$1,270 and the total cost for all health IT developers (792 health IT
developers certified to the  
2014 Edition) to be $1 million. We note that this is a one-time cost and
would not be perpetual.  
  
We also note that mailing is one option for delivery, along with other
means such as  
email. We do not have information concerning how health IT developers
will deliver their  
notices. We have estimated a total cost for all developers to mail the
notices (including postage)  
to be $80,000. Again, we note that this is a one-time cost. We welcome
comments on these cost  
estimates.  
  
In order to meet the Cures Act requirement that health IT developers do
not prohibit or  
restrict communication regarding health IT, ** some health IT developers
would eventually need to  
amend their contracts to reflect such a change. Many standard form
health IT contracts limit the  
ability of users to voluntarily discuss problems or report usability and
safety concerns that they  
experience when using their health IT. This type of discussion or
reporting is typically prohibited  
through broad confidentiality, nondisclosure, and intellectual property
provisions in the vendor’s  
standard form health IT contract. Some standard form health IT contracts
may also include non-  
disparagement clauses that prohibit customers from making statements
that could reflect  
negatively on the health IT developer. These practices are often
referred to colloquially in the

industry as “gag clauses.” We expect amendments to these clauses to be
accomplished in the  
normal course of business, such as when renegotiating contracts or
updating them for HIPAA or  
other compliance requirements. As such, we do not estimate any direct or
indirect costs for  
health IT developers to amend their contracts to comply with this
condition of certification.  
  
*Benefits*  
  
We expect health care providers to benefit from this proposal. There is
growing  
recognition that these practices of prohibiting or restricting
communication do not promote  
health IT safety or good security hygiene and that health IT contracts
should support and  
facilitate the transparent exchange of information relating to patient
care. We are unable to  
estimate these benefits because we do not have adequate information to
determine the prevalence  
of gag clauses and other such restrictive practices, nor do we have a
means to quantify the value  
to providers of being able to freely communicate and share information.
We welcome comments  
on approaches to quantify these benefits.  
*3.4 Application Programming Interfaces*  
  
For a discussion of the costs and benefits of the new API criterion,
please see section 2.3  
of this RIA.  
*3.5 Transparency Requirements for Application Programming Interfaces*  
We propose as part of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification
that API  
Technology Suppliers be required to make specific business and technical
documentation  
necessary to interact with the APIs in production freely and publicly
accessible. We expect that  
the API Technology Suppliers would perform the following tasks related
to transparency of  
business and technical documentation and would devote the following
number of hours annually

to such task: (1) Health Level 7’s (HL7®) Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (FHIR®)  
API documentation (the vendor would most likely point to the HL7 FHIR
standard for API  
documentation) (estimated eight hours); (2) patient application
registration documentation,  
which would include a development effort to create a website that
manages the application  
registration activity (estimated 40 hours); (3) publication of the FHIR
Endpoint – Base URLs for  
all centrally managed providers (estimated 40 hours); (4) publication of
FHIR Endpoints for  
provider-managed APIs (estimated 160 hours); and (5) API cost
information documentation,  
which would typically be documented as a tiered rate based on usage or
some form of monthly  
rate (estimated 40 hours).  
We believe each of the above tasks would be performed by a “Software
Developer.”  
According to the May 2016 BLS occupational employment statistics, the
mean hourly wage for  
software developer is $50.14 [182](ONCs.html#587) As noted previously,
we have assumed that overhead costs  
(including benefits) are equal to 100% of pre-tax wages, so the hourly
wage including overhead  
costs is $100.28. Therefore, we estimate the cost per developer to be
$28,881. As noted in  
section 2.3 of this RIA, we estimate that 459 products from 394
developers will contain the API  
criterion. Therefore, we estimate the total developer total would be
$11.4 million. We note that  
this is a one-time cost and would not be perpetual.  
*3.6 Real World Testing*  
**  
The objective of real world testing is to verify the extent to which
deployed health IT  
products in operational production settings are demonstrating compliance
to certification criteria

and functioning with the intended use cases for continued maintenance of
certification. Real  
world testing should ensure certified health IT products have the
ability to share electronic health  
information between other systems. Real world testing should assess that
the certified health IT  
is meeting the intended use case(s) of the certification criteria to
which it is certified within the  
workflow, health IT architecture, and care/practice setting in which the
health IT is implemented.  
We note that we expect real world testing would take about three months
of the year to perform.  
*Costs*  
  
This section describes the potential costs of the real world testing
requirements in this  
proposed rule. The costs estimates are based on the following
assumptions:  
  
1\. **Health IT developers will use the same labor costs**. Table 24
shows the estimated labor  
costs for a health IT developer to perform real world testing. We
recognize that health IT  
developer costs will vary; however, our estimates in this section assume
all developers will  
incur the costs noted in Table 24.  
2\. **Proxy needed to project the number of 2015 Edition products
impacted by real world**  
**testing.** We estimate that 523 products from 429 developers will be
impacted by real world  
testing. We used a proxy to determine developers that would be subject
to real world testing  
There were 681 products and 551 developers with at least one of its 2014
Edition certified  
products that could perform either (or both) transitions of care and/or
send any type of public  
health data. We then multiplied these numbers by our estimates for
certified health IT market  
consolidation by -22.1% and -23.2% to project number of 2015 developers
and products,  
respectively. We believe this estimate serves as a reasonable proxy for
products impacted by  
real world testing, as these products primarily focus on
interoperability.

Based on the stated assumptions and costs outlined in the above tables,
we estimate the  
total annual cost for real world testing would, on average, be $46
million with an average cost  
per developer of $107,259.  
*Benefits*  
  
There are a number of benefits that can be attributed to real world
testing. Real world  
testing may impact the effective integration of varied health IT
systems, including integration of  
certified health IT with non-certified and ancillary technologies such
as picture archiving and  
communications systems (PACS) or specialty specific interfaces. Real
world testing might also  
have an effect on the effective implementation of workflows in a
clinical setting. In this analysis,  
we have calculated the benefits in the following categories:  
1\. Provider time saved documenting in their EHR due to improved
usability.  
2\. Increased provider satisfaction with their EHR resulting in fewer
providers incurring the  
costs of switching products.  
3\. Benefits related to reductions in duplicate lab tests, readmissions,
ER visits, and adverse drug  
events due to increased interoperability. We focused on these outcomes
for two reasons: (i)  
evidence in literature indicate that health information exchange impacts
the chosen measures;  
and (ii) cost of care associated with these measures is high and the
impact of health  
information exchange is likely to result in significant benefits in the
form of reduced costs.  
The benefit calculations are based on the following assumptions:  
1\. **Benefits noted in academic literature are assumed accurate and
results were not**  
**externally validated**. Estimates of the benefits associated with the
benefits are based on

estimates obtained from the academic literature. Staff reviewed the
academic articles for  
validity, but estimates were not replicated to confirm accuracy.  
2\. **Hospitals and eligible professionals that participate in the CMS
EHR Incentive**  
**Program will be impacted**. Estimates are based on the assumption that
439,187 health care  
providers and/or 4,519 hospitals will be affected by this regulatory
action.  
3\. **Estimates of the impact of real world testing on rates of
interoperability (0.1 to 1%) are**  
**based on ONC analysis**. To identify the impact of real world testing
on interoperability, we  
used regression analysis. Specifically, we estimated linear probability
models that identified  
impact of 2014 Edition certified EHR on hospitals’ interoperability
(whether a hospital  
sends, receives, finds, and integrates summary of care records). Using
data from the AHA  
from years 2014-2015 in the model, we controlled for hospital size,
profit status,  
participation in a health information organization, and state and year
fixed effects. The  
marginal effect of using a 2014 Edition was a five percentage point
increase in  
interoperability. This is an upper bound estimate. For the purpose of
this analysis, we assume  
0.1% to 1% would be a reasonable range for real world testing to impact
interoperability.  
4\. **Impact of real world testing is also based on the estimated number
of providers that**  
**switch health IT developers (rate = 5%).** Using CMS Medicare EHR
Incentive Program  
data from years 2013-2016, we estimate the rate of providers (hospitals
and eligible  
professionals) that changed their health IT developer.  
5\. **Estimates of the rate of eligible professionals (10%) and
hospitals (5%) that will be**  
**impacted by real world testing are based on ONC complaint data.**
Because real world  
testing is designed to improve usability and interoperability of
products, we assume that

those eligible professionals and hospitals most likely to be impacted
are those who currently  
use products by health IT developers with complaints.  
  
As noted previously in this analysis, we acknowledge that there might be
shared benefits  
across certain proposals and have taken steps to ensure that the
benefits attributed to each  
proposal are unique to the proposal referenced. Specifically, we used
regression analysis to  
calculate the impact of our real world testing and API proposals on
interoperability. We assumed  
that the real world testing and API proposals would collectively have
the same impact on  
interoperability as use of 2014 Edition certified health IT. Therefore,
we estimated linear  
probability models that identified the impact of 2014 Edition certified
health IT on hospitals’  
interoperability.[183](ONCs.html#592)We controlled for additional
factors such as participation in a health  
information exchange organization, hospital characteristics, and
urban/rural status. We found the  
marginal effect of using 2014 Edition certified health IT was a five
percentage point increase in  
interoperability.  
  
While we acknowledge that there might be shared benefits across
proposals, we have  
taken steps to ensure that the benefits attributed to each proposal is
unique to the proposal  
referenced. We assumed that this marginal effect is true for our
proposals and distributed the 5%  
benefit across our real world testing and API proposals at (.1-1%) to
(1-4%) respectively.  
Moreover, the number of providers impacted is proposal specific. Given
data limitations, we  
believe this approach allows us to estimate the benefits of our
proposals without double counting  
the impact each proposal might have on interoperability.

The first table below shows benefits of real world testing for providers
where we  
monetize the impact of real world testing as total amount saved by
reducing provider time spent  
with the health IT. The impact of real world testing on provider time is
expected to represent a  
larger impact (5%) than the impact of real world testing on health
outcomes (1%-4%) and cost.  
This is primarily because provider behavior is more directly affected by
improvements in  
interoperability.

Based on the stated assumptions and benefits outlined in Table 26 above,
we estimate the  
total annual benefit for real world testing to providers would, on
average, range from $105  
million to $516 million. Based on the stated assumptions and benefits
outlined in Table 27  
above, we estimate the total annual benefit for patients and payers
would, on average, range from  
$4.3 million to $25.5 million. Therefore, we estimate the total benefit
of real world testing  
would, on average, range from $109.3 million to $541.5 million. If we
assume, based on our cost  
estimates, the average annual costs to health IT developers would be $46
million and that  
increased health IT developer costs are passed to customers, then the
net benefit to  
hospitals/providers would range from $63.3 million to $495.5 million.  
  
We recognize that health IT developers may deploy their systems in a
number of ways,  
including cloud-based deployments, and seek comment on whether our cost
estimates of real  
world testing should factor in such methods of system deployment. For
example, we request  
feedback about whether health IT developers would incur reduced real
world testing costs

through cloud-based deployments as opposed to other deployment methods.
We specifically  
solicit comment on the general ratio of cloud-based to non-cloud-based
deployments within the  
health care ecosystem and specific cost variations in performing real
world testing based on the  
type of deployment. We also request comment on our assumptions about the
burden to providers  
in time spent assisting health IT developers since we encourage health
IT developers to come up  
with ways to perform real world testing that mitigate provider
disruption.  
*3.6.1* *Real World Testing Maintenance Requirements*  
  
We propose to revise the Principle of Proper Conduct in § 170.523(m) to
require ONC-  
ACBs to collect, no less than quarterly, all updates successfully made
to standards in certified  
health IT pursuant to the developers having opted to avail themselves of
the Standards Version  
Advancement Process flexibility under the real world testing Condition
of Certification. Under §  
170.523(p), ONC-ACBs will be responsible for: (1) reviewing and
confirming that applicable  
health IT developers submit real world testing plans in accordance with
§ 170.405(b)(1); (2)  
reviewing and confirming that applicable health IT developers submit
real world testing results  
in accordance with § 170.405(b)(2); and (3) submitting real world
testing plans by December 15  
and results by April 1 of each calendar year to ONC for public
availability. In addition, under §  
170.523(t), ONC-ACBs will be required to: (1) maintain a record of the
date of issuance and the  
content of developers’ notices; and (2) timely post content of each
notice on the CHPL.  
  
Using the information from the “Real World Testing” section of this RIA,
we estimate  
that 429 developers will be impacted by real world testing. We estimate
that, on average, it will  
take an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-13, Step 1 level approximately 30
minutes to collect all  
updates made to standards in Health IT Modules in accordance with §
170.523(m). The hourly

wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington,
DC is approximately  
$88.30. Since the collection must occur no less than quarterly, we
assume it occurs, on average,  
four times per year. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost to ONC-ACBs
to comply with the  
collection requirements under § 170.523(m) to be $139,867.  
  
We estimate that, on average, it will take an ONC-ACB employee at the
GS-13, Step 1  
level approximately 1 hour to review and confirm that applicable health
IT developers submit  
real world testing plans in accordance with § 170.405(b)(1). We estimate
that, on average, it will  
take an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-13, Step 1 level approximately 30
minutes to review and  
confirm that applicable health IT developers submit real world testing
results in accordance with  
§ 170.405(b)(2). We estimate that, on average, it will take an ONC-ACB
employee at the GS-13,  
Step 1 level approximately 30 minutes to submit real world testing plans
and results to ONC for  
public availability. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1
employee located in  
Washington, DC is approximately $88.30. Therefore, we estimate the
annual cost to ONC-ACBs  
to comply with the submission and reporting requirements under §§
170.523(m) and 170.550(l)  
to be $143,891.  
  
Throughout the RIA we have used 830 products as our 2015 Edition
Projection. We came  
up with this projection by multiplying a -23.2% market consolidation
rate from the total number  
of products certified to 2014 Edition. This assumption was based on the
market consolidation  
rate observed between the 2011 and 2014 Editions. We have estimated the
number of 2015  
Edition products that will certify each criteria included in the real
world testing Condition of  
Certification. We assume that there will be a cost associated with a
notice for each certified  
criteria (even if an individual product were to update the same standard
across multiple criteria

that use that standard). This estimation was calculated by multiplying
the current percent of 2015  
Edition products that certify a criteria by the estimated number of
total 2015 Edition products  
(830).  
We assume that the amount of time for an ONC-ACB staff person to (1)
maintain a  
record of the date of issuance and the content of developers’ notices;
and (2) to timely post  
content of each notice on the CHPL can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 1
hour.  
The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in
Washington, DC  
is approximately $88.30. This was the hourly rate we used for the RIA,
so it’s consistent with  
prior calculations. This wage is used to determine the ONC-ACB time cost
to complete this  
requirement under § 170.523(t). Our minimum estimate for the amount of
time to comply is 30  
minutes per notice. If 25% of certified products update any of the
applicable standards, we  
estimate it will cost $58,807. If all products update any of the
applicable standards, we estimate  
it will cost $235,231. Our maximum estimate for the amount of time to
comply is 1 hour per  
notice. If 25% of certified products update any of the applicable
standards, we estimate it will  
cost $117,615. If all products update any of the applicable standards,
we estimate it will cost  
$470,462. Our lower bound estimate for the cost of this requirement is
$58,807. Our upper  
bound estimate for the cost of this requirement is $470,462.  
  
*3.8 Attestations*  
  
The **** Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition
and Maintenance of  
Certification under the Program, provide to the Secretary an attestation
to all the Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification specified in the Cures Act, except for the
“EHR reporting program”  
Condition of Certification. It also requires that a health IT developer
attest to ensuring that its

health IT allows for health information to be exchanged, accessed, and
used in the  
manner described by the API Condition of Certification. We propose to
implement the Cures Act  
“attestations” Condition of Certification in § 170.406 by requiring
health IT developers to attest  
to the aforementioned conditions. For the purposes of estimating the
potential burden of these  
attestations on health IT developers, ONC-ACBs, and ONC, we are
estimating that all health IT  
developers under the Program will submit an attestation biannually. As
noted previously in this  
RIA, there are 792 health IT developers certified to the 2014 Edition.  
  
We estimate it will take a health IT developer employee approximately
one hour on  
average to prepare and submit each attestation to the ONC-ACB. According
to the May 2016  
BLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for a
software developer is  
$50.14 [184](ONCs.html#599)Therefore, we estimate the annual cost
including overhead costs to be $79,422.  
  
We propose that attestations would be submitted to ONC-ACBs on behalf of
ONC and  
the Secretary. We assume there will be three ONC-ACBs as this is the
current number of ONC-  
ACBs, and we also assume an equal distribution in responsibilities among
ONC-ACBs. ONC-  
ACBs would have two responsibilities related to attestations. One
responsibility we propose in §  
170.523(q) is that an ONC-ACB must review and submit the health IT
developers’ attestations to  
ONC. We estimate it will take an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-13, Step 1
level approximately  
30 minutes on average to review and submit each attestation to ONC. The
other responsibility we  
propose in § 170.550(l) is that before issuing a certification, an
ONC-ACB would need to ensure  
that the health IT developer of the Health IT Module has met its
responsibilities related to the

Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements as solely
evidenced by its attestation.  
We estimate it will take an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-13, Step 1 level
approximately one  
hour on average to complete this task. The hourly wage with benefits for
a GS-13, Step 1  
employee located in Washington, DC is approximately $88.30. Therefore,
we estimate the  
annual cost to ONC-ACBs to be $209,801.  
  
We propose that ONC would make the attestations publicly available on
the CHPL once  
they are submitted by the ONC-ACBs. ONC posts information regularly to
the CHPL and we  
estimate the added costs to post the attestation will be de minimis. We
welcome comments if  
stakeholders believe more or less networks should be included in our
estimate.  
(4) Oversight for the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification  
  
ONC’s processes for overseeing the Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification will, for  
the most part, mirror ONC’s processes for direct review of
non-conformities in certified health  
IT as described in current § 170.580. We have proposed that ONC may
directly review a health  
IT developer’s actions to determine whether they conform to the
Conditions and Maintenance of  
Certification requirements proposed in this proposed rule. The estimated
costs and benefits for  
such oversight and review are detailed below.  
*Costs*  
We estimated the potential monetary costs of our proposal to allow ONC
to directly  
review a health IT developer’s actions to determine whether the actions
conform to the  
requirements of the Program as follows: (1) costs for health IT
developers to correct non-  
conforming actions identified by ONC; (2) costs for health IT developers
and ONC related to  
ONC review and inquiry into non-conforming actions by the health IT
developer; and (3) costs

Principles of Proper  
Conduct in § 170.523(s).  
*Costs for Health IT Developers to Correct Non-Conforming Actions
Identified by ONC*  
We do not believe health IT developers face additional direct costs for
the proposed ONC  
direct review of health IT developer actions (*see* cost estimates for
the Conditions and  
Maintenance of Certification requirements). However, we acknowledge that
this proposed rule  
may eventually require health IT developers to correct certain actions
or non-conformities with  
their health IT that do not conform to the Conditions and Maintenance of
Certification.  
If ONC identifies a non-conforming action by a health IT developer, the
costs incurred by  
the health IT developer to bring its actions into conformance would be
determined on a case-by-  
case basis. Factors that would be considered include, but are not
limited to: (1) the extent of  
customers and/or business affected; (2) how pervasive the action(s) is
across the health IT  
developer’s business; (3) the period of time that the health IT
developer was taking the action(s)  
in question; and (4) the corrective action required to resolve the
issue. We are unable to reliably  
estimate these costs as we do not have cost estimates for a comparable
situation. We request  
comment on existing relevant data and methods we could use to estimate
these costs.  
*Costs for Health IT Developers and ONC Related to ONC Review and
Inquiry into  
Health IT Developer Actions  
  
*In order to calculate the potential costs to health IT developers and
ONC related to ONC  
review and inquiry into health IT developer actions, we have created the
following categories for  
potential costs: (1) ONC review and inquiry prior to the issuance of a
notice of non-conformity;  
(2) ONC review and inquiry following the issuance of a notice of
non-conformity and the health  
IT developer does not contest ONC’s findings (i.e., no appeal); and (3)
ONC review and inquiry

following the issuance of a notice of non-conformity and the health IT
developer contests ONC’s  
findings (i.e., appeal).  
*ONC Review and Inquiry Prior to the Issuance of a Notice of
Non-conformity*  
We anticipate that ONC will receive, on average, between 100 and 200
complaints per  
year concerning the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification that
will warrant review and  
inquiry by ONC. We estimate that such initial review and inquiry by ONC
would require, on  
average, two to three analysts at the GS-13 level working one to two
hours each per complaint.  
The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in
Washington, DC is  
approximately $88.30. Therefore, we estimate each review and inquiry
would cost ONC, on  
average, between $177 and $529. We estimate the total annual cost to ONC
would, on average,  
range from $17,700 and $105,800. This range takes into account both the
low end of reviews that  
are resolved quickly and the high end in which staff would need to
discuss issues with ONC  
leadership or in some cases, HHS senior leadership including the Office
of General Counsel. We  
have not estimated health IT developer costs associated with ONC review
prior to the issuance of  
a notice of non-conformity because, in most cases, health IT developers
are not required to take  
action prior to the notice of non-conformity.  
*ONC Review and Inquiry Following the Issuance of a Notice of
Non-conformity and the  
Health IT Developer Does Not Contest ONC’s Findings  
  
*This category would capture cases that require review and inquiry
following ONC’s  
issuance of a notice of non-conformity, but that would not proceed to
the appeals process.  
Examples of such situations would include, but not be limited to: (1) a
health IT developer  
violates a Condition of Certification and does not contest ONC’s finding
that it is in violation of  
the Condition of Certification; or (2) a health IT developer fails to
meet a deadline, such as for its

corrective action plan (CAP). We estimate that ONC will, on average,
conduct between 12 and  
18 of these reviews annually.  
We estimate that a health IT developer may commit, on average and
depending on  
complexity, between 10 and 40 hours of staff time per case to provide
ONC with all requested  
records and documentation that ONC would use to review and conduct an
inquiry into health IT  
developer actions, and, when necessary, make a certification ban and/or
termination  
determination. We assumed that the work would be performed by a
“Computer Systems  
Analyst.” According to the May 2016 BLS occupational employment
statistics, the mean hourly  
wage for computer systems analyst is $44.05. [185](ONCs.html#603) As
noted previously, we have assumed that  
overhead costs (including benefits) are equal to 100% of pre-tax wages,
so the hourly wage  
including overhead costs would be $88.10. Therefore, we estimate the
average annual cost for  
health IT developers would range from $10,572 to $63,432. We note that
some health IT  
developers’ costs are expected to be less and some health IT developers’
costs are expected to be  
more than this estimated cost range. Further, we note that these costs
would be perpetual.  
We estimate that ONC may commit, on average and depending on complexity,
between 8  
and 80 hours of staff time to complete a review and inquiry into health
IT developer actions. We  
assume that the expertise of a GS-15, Step 1 federal employee(s) would
be necessary. The hourly  
wage with benefits for a GS-15, Step 1 employee located in Washington,
DC is approximately  
$122.74. Therefore, based on the estimate of between 12 and 18 cases
each year, we estimate  
ONC’s annual costs would on, average range, from $11,783 to $176,745. We
note that some

*ONC Review and Inquiry Following the Issuance of a Notice of
Non-Conformity and the  
Health IT Developer Contests ONC’s Findings  
  
*As discussed in section VII.C of this preamble, we propose to permit a
health IT  
developer to appeal an ONC determination to issue a certification ban
and/or terminate a  
certification under § **** 170.581(a)(2)(iii). This category of cost
calculations captures cases that  
require review and inquiry following ONC’s issuance of a notice of
non-conformity and where  
the health IT developer contests ONC’s finding and files an appeal. We
estimate that ONC will,  
on average, conduct between three and five of these reviews annually.  
We estimate that a “Computer Systems Analyst” for the health IT
developer may commit,  
on average and depending on complexity, between 20 and 80 hours to
provide the required  
information to appeal a certification ban and/or termination under §
**** 170.581(a)(2)(iii) and  
respond to any requests from the hearing officer. According to the May
2016 BLS occupational  
employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for a computer systems
analyst is $44.05.[186](ONCs.html#604)  
Assuming that overhead costs (including benefits) are equal to 100% of
pre-tax wages, the  
hourly wage including overhead costs is $88.10. Therefore, we estimate
the annual cost,  
including overhead costs, for a health IT developer to appeal a
certification ban and/or  
termination under § **** 170.581(a)(2)(iii) would, on average, range
from $5,286 to $35,240. We

note that some health IT developers’ costs are expected to be less and
some health IT developers’  
costs are expected to be more than this estimated cost range. Further,
we note that these costs  
would be perpetual.  
We estimate that ONC would commit, on average and depending on
complexity, between  
40 and 160 hours of staff time to conduct each appeal. This would
include the time to represent  
ONC in the appeal and support the costs for the hearing officer. We
assume that the expertise of  
a GS-15, Step 1 federal employee(s) would be necessary. The hourly wage
with benefits for a  
GS-15, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately
$122.74. Therefore, based  
on the estimate on between three and five cases each year, we estimate
the cost for ONC to  
conduct an appeal would, on average, range from $14,729 to $98,192. We
note that some appeals  
may cost less and some may cost more than this estimated cost range.
Further, we note that these  
costs would be perpetual.  
Based on the above estimates, we estimate the total ** annual costs for
health IT developers  
related to ONC review and inquiry into health IT developer actions
would, on average, range  
from $15,858 to $98,672. We estimate the total ** annual costs for ONC
related to ONC review and  
inquiry into health IT developer actions would, on average, range from
$44,212 to $380,737. **  
We welcome comments on our estimated costs and any comparable processes
and costs  
that we could use to improve our cost estimates.  
*Costs for ONC-ACBs*  
  
We also note that ONC-ACBs could realize costs associated with the new
proposed  
reporting requirement in the Principles of Proper Conduct in §
170.523(s) that they report, at a  
minimum, on a weekly basis to the National Coordinator any circumstances
that could trigger

ONC direct review per § 170.580(a)(2). We estimate that, on average, it
will take an ONC-ACB  
employee at the GS-13, Step 1 level approximately 30 minutes to prepare
the report. The hourly  
wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington,
DC is approximately  
$88.30. Since the collection must occur no less than weekly, we will
assume it occurs, on  
average, 52 times per year. Therefore, given that there are currently
three ONC-ACBs, we  
estimate the annual cost to ONC-ACBs to comply with the reporting
requirement under §  
170.523(s) would, on average, be $6,889.  
*Benefits*  
This proposed rule’s provisions for ONC direct review of the Conditions
and  
Maintenance of Certification requirements would promote health IT
developers’ accountability  
for their actions and ensure that health IT developers’ actions conform
with the requirements of  
the Cures Act and Conditions and Maintenance of Certification
requirements in §§ 170.400-406.  
Specifically, ONC’s direct review of health IT developer actions will
facilitate ONC’s ability to  
require comprehensive corrective action by health IT developers to
address non-conforming  
actions determined by ONC. If ONC ultimately implements a certification
ban and/or terminates  
a certification(s), such action will serve to protect the integrity of
the Program and users of health  
IT. While we do not have available means to quantify the benefits of ONC
direct review of  
health IT developer actions, we note that ONC direct review supports and
enables the National  
Coordinator to fulfill his responsibilities under the HITECH Act and
Cures Act, instills public  
confidence in the Program, and protects public health and safety.

We expect ONC to incur an annual cost for issuing guidance related to
the information  
blocking “reasonable and necessary” exceptions. We assume that the
guidance would be  
provided by ONC staff with the expertise of a GS-15, Step 1 federal
employee(s). The hourly  
wage with benefits for a GS-15, Step 1 employee located in Washington,
DC is approximately  
$122.74. We estimate it would take ONC staff between 200 and 400 hours
to develop the  
guidance. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost to ONC would, on
average, range from $98,192  
to $196,384. **  
*Benefits*  
Information blocking not only interferes with effective health
information exchange, but  
also negatively impacts many important aspects of health and health
care. To make informed  
health care decisions, providers and individuals must have timely access
to information in a form  
that is usable. When health information is unavailable, decisions can be
impaired—and so too the  
safety, quality, and effectiveness of care provided to patients.
Information blocking impedes  
progress towards reforming health care delivery and payment because
sharing information  
seamlessly across the care continuum is fundamental to moving to a
person-centered, high-  
performing health care system. Information blocking can undermine
consumers’ confidence in  
their health care providers by preventing individuals from accessing
their health information and  
using it to make informed decisions about their health and health care.
Information blocking also  
prevents advances in biomedical and public health research, which
require the ability to analyze  
information from many sources in order to identify public health risks,
develop new treatments  
and cures, and enable precision medicine.

In addition, information blocking is a practice that is profoundly
anti-consumer and anti-  
competition. Information blocking can be used to increase revenue,
escalate prices, and prevent  
market competition both for current and future competitors and for new
services. For instance, a  
study released in 2017 about the prevalence of information blocking and
how to address it  
assessed the perceived motivations for information blocking. The study
found that respondents  
perceived that information-blocking practices by health IT developers
were often motivated by a  
desire to maximize short-term revenue and to increase the likelihood
that providers will select  
their health IT instead of a competitor's health IT. Among hospitals and
health systems, the most  
frequent perceived motivation was also related to improving revenue,
namely to strengthen their  
competitive position in the market, followed by accommodating more
important internal  
priorities than health information exchange.[187](ONCs.html#608)  
According to leaders of health information exchange efforts, information
blocking is  
relatively widespread.[188](ONCs.html#608) Half of leaders of health
information exchange efforts (n=60)  
nationwide reported that they routinely encountered information blocking
by health IT  
developers. The top three types of information blocking practices they
encountered on a routine  
basis included:  
• Deployment of products with limited interoperability (49%);  
• High fees for health information exchange unrelated to cost (47%);
and  
• Making third-party access to standardized data difficult (42%).

Many hospitals have experienced the negative impacts of health IT
developer information  
blocking practices. In 2015, almost half of hospitals (46%) nationwide
reported difficulty  
exchanging data with providers whose health IT system differed from
theirs and one-quarter of  
hospitals reported paying additional costs to exchange electronic health
information with  
providers outside their hospital system.[189](ONCs.html#609)There is
also emerging evidence related to the  
negative impacts of information blocking at the market level on
hospitals’ health information  
exchange activity.[190](ONCs.html#609) Health information exchange
activity among hospitals who are using a  
dominant health IT developer within a given hospital referral region was
found to be  
significantly higher compared to those that are using a non-dominant
health IT developer,  
particularly in more competitive markets where dominant health IT
developers had a smaller  
share of the market. As information blocking diminishes and information
blocking becomes less  
prevalent, such gaps in rates of exchange and barriers to exchange of
health information should  
diminish. Considering the above motivations for and consequences of
information blocking, we  
believe health care providers and patients will benefit greatly from
compliance with the  
information blocking definition. Our proposal would promote the free
flow of electronic health  
information when and where it is needed.  
  
We have also included provisions in this proposed rule that would
establish exceptions to  
the definition of information blocking, which we estimate will generate
significant net benefits.  
As noted above, section 3022 of the PHSA defines information blocking
broadly section

necessary activities that

would be considered establish exceptions to the definition of
information blocking. In this rule,  
we propose to establish several exceptions. The exceptions, if
finalized, would create clear  
guidelines for industry regarding pro-competitive and other beneficial
activities and would  
enable stakeholders to determine more easily and with greater certainty
whether their activities  
are excepted from the information blocking definition. The additional
clarity provided by the  
exceptions would make it easier for these regulated entities to comply
with the statute—resulting  
in reduced compliance costs—and would result in increased
predictability, which would allow  
regulated entities to more effectively plan and invest resources in
developing and using  
interoperable technologies and services to improve health care
efficiency and value. Overall, the  
proposed exceptions are accommodating to legitimate industry practices
for health IT  
developers, hospitals, and health care providers and, we believe, would
ease the burden and  
compliance costs for these parties.  
Due to limited data and research available, we have only estimated the
benefits of our  
information blocking proposals for payers, specifically patients and
insurers. In order to  
quantify the magnitude of information blocking and the benefits of
restricting information  
blocking, we estimated the following expression, which gives us the
imposed cost of information  
blocking for each health outcome: \[% providers that engage in
cross-vendor exchange\] **x**  
\[marginal effect (ME) of information blocking\] **x** \[ME effect of
interoperability\] **x** \[total cost of  
health outcome\].  
  
We extracted the “ME effect of interoperability” and “cost of health
outcomes” from  
academic literature (*see* citations in Table 28). We used a proxy of
the “percent of providers

engaged in cross-vendor exchange” with the “percent of hospitals engaged
in cross-vendor  
referral of patients outside their system” (82% in 2015).  
  
We estimated the “ME of information blocking” through the following
research design.  
We looked at hospitals that switched vendors and examined their referral
patterns before and  
after the switch. If hospitals that switched vendors also had to change
their referral patterns, this  
could be evidence of information blocking. To operationalize this
experiment, we estimated the  
following equation: Y = b \* S + r + h + e.  
  
In this equation, the variables are as follows:  
• Y = Percent of referrals to providers using a vendor to which the
hospital switched  
• b = Estimate of interest, which reflects the change in referral to the
vendors after the switch  
relative to hospitals that did not switch. After controlling for
hospital and year fixed, this is  
essentially an interaction effect of the year with the switch.  
• S = Indicator for whether hospital switched vendor  
• r = Year  
• h = Hospital fixed effects  
• e = Error term (every regression has an error term)  
  
We used CMS referral data and linked it with Healthcare Information and
Management  
Systems Society (HIMSS) and AHA data for information on hospitals’
vendors and other  
characteristics. Our estimate for “b” is 0.4 percentage points, meaning
if a hospital switches to  
vendor X, the referrals to hospitals with that vendor increases by a
rate of 0.4 percentage points.  
This number we interpret as a proxy for the extent to which difficulties
in cross vendor exchange  
hinder patient care. However, our finding does not imply that
difficulties in cross vendor

exchange can be entirely attributed to information blocking. One source
of difficulties could be  
explained by technological challenges where inherent software
differences among vendors  
hinder cross vendor exchange. An additional reason for this result could
be attributed to  
contractual agreements where vendors may incentivize their clients to
exchange with other  
clients having the same vendor. Nevertheless, to keep our estimates
conservative, we reduced our  
estimates by a factor of five. . Hence, we use 0.08 percentage points as
the “ME of information  
blocking.”

We request comment on our approach to estimating these benefits, as well
as the benefit  
estimates in the table above.  
(6) Total Annual Cost Estimate  
We estimate that the total annual cost for this proposed rule for the
first year after it is  
finalized (including one-time costs), based on the cost estimates
outlined above and throughout  
this RIA, would, on average, range from $365 million to $919 million
with an average annual  
cost of $642 million. We estimate that the total perpetual cost for this
proposed rule (starting in  
year two), based on the cost estimates outlined above, would, on
average, range from $228  
million to $452 million with an average annual cost of $340 million. We
also include estimates  
based on the stakeholder group affected. We estimate the total costs to
health IT developers to be

between $373 million and $933 million (including one-time and perpetual
costs) with $569,000  
in cost savings. We estimate the total costs to ONC-ACBs to be between
$213,000 and  
$311,000. We estimate the government (ONC) costs to be between $44,800
and $269,000 while  
saving $4,500. In addition, to the above mentioned cost savings that are
attributable to specific  
stakeholder groups, we estimate to an additional cost savings of $6.8
million to $13.7 million to  
all stakeholders affected by this proposal. We are unable to attribute
these amounts to specific  
stakeholder groups. **  
(7) Total Annual Benefit Estimate  
  
We estimate the total annual benefit for this proposed rule, based on
the benefit estimates  
outlined above, would range from $3.08 billion to $9.15 billion with an
average annual benefit of  
$6.1 billion. We attribute between $756 million and $3.8 billion in
benefits to hospitals and  
clinicians. We attribute between $2.1 billion and $2.9 billion to payers
and patients. Our  
estimates include benefits attributed to the whole health care system,
not just to the stakeholders  
mentioned above.  
(8) Total Annual Net Benefit  
We estimate the total annual net benefit for this proposed rule for the
first year after it is  
finalized (including one-time costs), based on the estimates outlined
above, would range from  
$2.7 billion to $8.2 billion with an average net benefit of $5.5
billion. We estimate the total  
perpetual annual net benefit for this proposed rule (starting in year
two), based on the estimates  
outlined above, would range from $2.9 billion to $8.7 billion with an
average net benefit of $5.8  
billion.

When a rule is considered an economically significant rule under
Executive Order 12866,  
we are required to develop an accounting statement indicating the
classification of the  
expenditures associated with the provisions of the proposed rule.
Monetary annual benefits are  
presented as discounted flows using 3% and 7% factors in Table 29 below.
We are not able to  
explicitly define the universe of all costs, but have provided an
average of likely costs of this  
proposed rule as well as a high and low range of likely costs. This
proposed rule requires no  
federal annual monetized transfers.

3\. Regulatory Flexibility Act  
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires agencies to analyze
options for regulatory  
relief of small businesses if a rule has a significant impact on a
substantial number of small  
entities. The Small Business Administration (SBA) establishes the size
of small businesses for  
federal government programs based on average annual receipts or the
average employment of a  
firm.[191](ONCs.html#616)The entities that are likely to be directly
affected by the requirements in this proposed  
rule requirements are health IT developers. We note that the proposed
reasonable and necessary  
activities that do not constitute information blocking provide
flexibilities and relief for health IT  
developers of certified health IT, health information networks, health
information exchanges, and  
health care providers in relation to the information blocking provision
of the Cures Act. These  
proposed reasonable and necessary activities also take into account the
potential burden on small  
entities to meet these “exceptions” to information blocking, such as
with considering the size and  
  
191 The SBA references that annual receipts means “total income” (or in
the case of a sole proprietorship, “gross  
income”) plus “cost of goods sold” as these terms are defined and
reported on Internal Revenue Service tax return  
forms.

**NOTICE**

Federal Register (OFR) for publication and  
has not yet been placed on public display or published in the Federal

resources of small entities when meeting security requirements to
qualify for the “promoting the  
security of electronic health information” exception. We refer readers
to section VIII for our  
information blocking-related proposals and welcome comments on their
impacts on small  
entities.  
While health IT developers that pursue certification of their health IT
under the Program  
represent a small segment of the overall information technology
industry, we believe that many  
health IT developers impacted by the requirements proposed in this
proposed rule most likely fall  
under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code
541511 “Custom  
Computer Programming Services.” [192](ONCs.html#617)The SBA size
standard associated with this NAICS code  
is set at $27.5 million annual receipts or less. There is enough data
generally available to  
establish that between 75% and 90% of entities that are categorized
under the NAICS code  
541511 are under the SBA size standard. We also note that with the
exception of aggregate  
business information available through the U.S. Census Bureau and the
SBA related to NAICS  
code 541511, it appears that many health IT developers that pursue
certification of their health IT  
under the Program are privately held or owned and do not regularly, if
at all, make their specific  
annual receipts publicly available. As a result, it is difficult to
locate empirical data related to  
many of these health IT developers to correlate to the SBA size
standard. However, although not  
perfectly correlated to the size standard for NAICS code 541511, we do
have information  
indicating that over 60% of health IT developers that have had Complete
EHRs and/or Health IT  
Modules certified to the 2011 Edition have less than 51
employees.

We estimate that the proposed requirements in this proposed rule would
have effects on  
health IT developers, some of which may be small entities, that have
certified health IT or are  
likely to pursue certification of their health IT under the Program. We
believe, however, that we  
have proposed the minimum amount of requirements necessary to accomplish
our primary policy  
goal of enhancing interoperability. Further, as discussed in section
XIV.B of this RIA above,  
there are no appropriate regulatory or non-regulatory alternatives that
could be developed to  
lessen the compliance burden associated with this proposed rule because
many of the proposals  
are derived directly form legislative mandates in the Cures Act.
Additionally, we have attempted  
to offset some of the burden imposed on health IT developers in this
proposed rule with cost  
saving proposals through deregulatory actions (*see* proposed section
III).  
We do not believe that the proposed requirements of this proposed rule
would create a  
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, but
request comment on whether  
there are small entities that we have not identified that may be
affected in a significant way by  
this proposed rule. Additionally, the Secretary proposes to certify that
this proposed rule would  
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities.  
4\. Executive Order 13132 - Federalism  
Executive Order 13132 establishes certain requirements that an agency
must meet when it  
promulgates a proposed rule (and subsequent final rule) that imposes
substantial direct  
requirement costs on state and local governments, preempts state law, or
otherwise has  
federalism implications. Nothing in this proposed rule imposes
substantial direct compliance  
costs on state and local governments, preempts state law, or otherwise
has federalism

implications. We are not aware of any state laws or regulations that are
contradicted or impeded  
by any of the proposals in this proposed rule. We welcome comments on
this assessment.  
5\. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995  
Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires that
agencies assess  
anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule that imposes
unfunded mandates on state,  
local, and tribal governments or the private sector requiring spending
in any one year of $100  
million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. The current
inflation-adjusted statutory  
threshold is approximately $150 million. While the estimated potential
cost effects of this  
proposed rule reach the statutory threshold, we do not believe this
proposed rule imposes  
unfunded mandates on state, local, and tribal governments or the private
sector. We welcome  
comments on these conclusions.  
6\. Executive Order 13771 Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory
Costs  
Executive Order 13771 (January 30, 2017) requires that the costs
associated with  
significant new regulations “to the extent permitted by law, be offset
by the elimination of  
existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations.” The
Department believes that this  
rule is a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order
12866 which imposes costs,  
and therefore is considered a regulatory action under Executive Order
13771. The Department  
estimates that this rule generates $275 million in annualized costs at a
7% discount rate,  
discounted relative to 2016, over a perpetual time horizon.  
OMB reviewed this proposed rule.

**Appendix: Pediatric Technical Worksheets**  
These worksheets contain information on how each recommendation
corresponds to the  
Children’s EHR Format and to the existing or proposed new ONC
certification criteria. We  
invite readers to use these worksheets to inform public comment on the
recommendations, the  
inclusion of specific items from the Children’s EHR
Format[193](ONCs.html#699), and the identified certification  
criteria as they relate specifically to use cases for pediatric care and
sites of service.  
We welcome public comment on the identified certification criteria for
each recommendation.  
Specifically, we seek comment for each recommendation on the following
four broad questions:  
• **Q1.** What relevant gaps, barriers, safety concerns, and/or
resources (including available best  
practices, activities, and tools) may impact or support feasibility of
the recommendation in  
practice?  
• **Q2.** How can the effective use of IT support each recommendation as
involves provider  
training, establishing workflow, and other related safety and usability
considerations?  
• **Q3.** Should any of the recommendations not be included?  
• **Q4.** Should any of the functional criteria listed under the
“Alignment with 2015 Edition  
Certification Criteria” and the “Alignment with Proposed New or Updated
Certification  
Criteria” be removed as a correlated item to support any of the
recommendations?  
Commenters are encouraged to reference the specific recommendation
number (110) with the  
corresponding question number in their response. For example,
“Recommendation 1.
Q3.”
