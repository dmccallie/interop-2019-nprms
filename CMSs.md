**I. Background and Summary of Provisions**  
A. Purpose ****  
  
This proposed rule is the first phase of proposed policies centrally
focused on advancing  
interoperability and patient access to health information using the
authority available to the  
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). We believe this is an
important step in  
advancing interoperability, putting patients at the center of their
health care and ensuring they  
have access to their health information. We are committed to solving the
issue of interoperability  
and achieving complete access to health information for patients in the
United States (U.S.)  
health care system, and are taking an active approach to move
participants in the health care  
market toward interoperability and the secure and timely exchange of
health information by  
proposing and adopting policies for the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
the Children’s Health  
Insurance Program (CHIP), and issuers of qualified health plans
(QHPs).  
Throughout this proposed rule, we refer to terms such as patient,
consumer, beneficiary,  
enrollee, and individual. We note that every reader of this proposed
rule is a patient and has or  
will receive medical care at some point in their life. In this proposed
rule, we use the term  
“patient” as an inclusive term, but because we have historically
referred to patients using other  
terms in our regulations, we use specific terms as applicable in
sections of this proposed rule to  

-----

<span id="5"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**5**  
refer to individuals covered under the health care programs that CMS
administers and regulates.  
We also use terms such as payer, plan, and issuer in this proposed rule.
Certain portions of this  
proposed rule are applicable to the Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS)
Program, the Medicaid FFS  
Program, the CHIP FFS program, Medicare Advantage (MA) Organizations,
Medicaid Managed  
Care plans (managed care organizations (MCOs), prepaid inpatient health
plans (PIHPs) and  
prepaid ambulatory health plans (PAHPs)), CHIP Managed Care entities
(MCOs, PIHPs, and  
PAHPs), and QHP issuers in Federally-facilitated Exchanges (FFEs). We
use the term “payer” as  
an inclusive term, but we use specific terms as applicable in sections
of this proposed rule.  
B. Overview  
We are dedicated to enhancing and protecting the health and well-being
of all **** Americans.  
One critical issue in the U.S. health care system is that people cannot
easily access their complete  
health information in interoperable forms. Patients and the health care
providers caring for them  
are often presented with an incomplete picture of their health and care
as pieces of their  
information are stored in various, unconnected systems and do not
accompany the patient to  
every care setting.  
  
We believe patients should have the ability to move from health plan to
health plan,  
provider to provider, and have both their clinical and administrative
information travel with them  
throughout their journey. When a patient receives care from a new
provider, a complete record of  
their health information should be readily available to that care
provider, regardless of where or  
by who care was previously provided. When a patient is discharged from a
hospital to a post-  
acute care (PAC) setting there should be no question as to how, when, or
where their data will be  
exchanged. Likewise, when an enrollee changes health plans or ages into
Medicare, the enrollee  
should be able to have their claims history and encounter data follow so
that information is not  
lost. ****  

-----

<span id="6"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**6**  
  
For providers in clinical settings, health information technology
(health IT) should be a  
resource, designed to make it faster and easier for providers to deliver
high quality care, creating  
efficiencies and allowing them to access all available data for their
patients. Health IT should not  
detract from the clinician-patient relationship, from the patient’s
experience of care, or from the  
quality of work life for physicians, nurses, and other health care
professionals. Through  
standards-based interoperability and exchange, health IT has the
potential to be a resource and  
facilitator for efficient, safe, high-quality care for individuals and
populations.  
  
All payers, including health plans, should have the ability to exchange
data seamlessly  
with other payers for timely benefits coordination or transitions, and
with providers to facilitate  
more coordinated and efficient care. Health plans are in a unique
position to provide enrollees a  
complete picture of their claims and encounter data, allowing patients
to piece together their own  
information that might otherwise be lost in disparate systems. This
information can contribute to  
better informed decision making, helping to inform the patient’s choice
of coverage options and  
care providers to more effectively manage their own health, care, and
costs.  
  
We are committed to solving the issue of interoperability and patient
access in the U.S.  
health care system while reducing administrative burdens on providers
and are taking an active  
approach using all available policy levers and authorities to move
participants in the health care  
market toward interoperability and the secure and timely exchange of
health care information.  
C. Executive Order and MyHealthEData  
  
  
On October 12, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13813 to
Promote  
Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States. Section
1(c)(iii) of Executive  
Order 13813 states that the Administration will improve access to, and
the quality of,  
information that Americans need to make informed health care decisions,
including information  

-----

<span id="7"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**7**  
about health care prices and outcomes, while minimizing reporting
burdens on affected plans,  
providers, and payers. ****  
  
In support of Executive Order 13813, the Administration launched the
MyHealthEData  
initiative. This government-wide initiative aims to empower patients by
ensuring that they have  
full access to their own health information and the ability to decide
how their data will be used,  
while keeping that information safe and secure. MyHealthEData aims to
break down the barriers  
that prevent patients from gaining electronic access to their health
information from the device or  
application of their choice, empowering patients and taking a critical
step toward interoperability  
and patient data exchange. ****  
  
In March 2018, the White House Office of American Innovation and the
CMS  
Administrator announced the launch of MyHealthEData, and CMS’s direct,
hands-on role in  
improving patient access and advancing interoperability. As part of the
MyHealthEData  
initiative, we are taking a patient-centered approach to health
information access and moving to a  
system in which patients have immediate access to their computable
health information and can  
be assured that their health information will follow them as they move
throughout the health care  
system from provider to provider, payer to payer. To accomplish this, we
have launched several  
initiatives related to data sharing and interoperability to empower
patients and encourage plan  
and provider competition. In this proposed rule, we continue to advance
the policies and goals of  
the MyHealthEData initiative through various proposals as outlined in
the following sections. ****  
  
Our proposals are wide-reaching and would have an impact on all facets
of the health  
care system. Several key touch points of the proposals in this rule
include:  
**●** *Patients*: Enabling patients to access their health information
electronically without  
special effort by requiring the payers subject to this proposed rule to
make the data available  
through an application programming interface (API) to which third party
software applications  

-----

<span id="8"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**8**  
connect to make the data available to patients. This encourages them to
take charge of and better  
manage their health care, and thus these initiatives are imperative to
improving a patient’s long-  
term health outcomes.  
● *Clinicians and Hospitals*: Ensuring that health care providers have
ready access to  
health information about their patients, regardless of where the patient
may have previously  
received care. We are also proposing policies to prevent health care
providers from  
inappropriately restricting the flow of information to other health care
providers and payers. ****  
Finally, we are working to ensure that better interoperability reduces
the burden on health care  
providers. ****  
● *Payers*: Proposing requirements to ensure that payers (that is,
entities and  
organizations that pay for health care), such as MA plans and Medicaid
and CHIP programs,  
make enrollee electronic health information held by the plan available
through an API such that,  
with use of software we expect payers and third parties to develop, the
information becomes  
easily accessible to the enrollee, and that the data flows seamlessly
with the enrollee as they  
change providers, plans, and issuers. Additionally, our proposals would
ensure that payers make  
it easy for current and prospective enrollees to identify which
providers are within a given plan’s  
network in a way that is simple and easy for enrollees to access and
understand, and thus find the  
providers that are right for them. ****  
  
Under our proposals to standardize data and technical approaches to
advance  
interoperability, we believe health care providers and their patients,
as well as other key  
participants within the health care ecosystem such as plans and payers,
will have appropriate  
access to the information necessary to coordinate individual care,
analyze population health  
trends, outcomes, and costs, and manage benefits and the health of
populations, while tracking  
progress through quality improvement initiatives. **** We are working
with other federal partners

including the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information
Technology (ONC) on  
this effort with the clear objective to improve patient access and care,
alleviate provider burden,  
and reduce overall health care costs. ****  
D. Past Efforts ****  
  
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been working to
advance the  
interoperability of electronic health information since 2004, when the
ONC was initially created  
via Executive Order 13335. From 2004 to 2009, ONC worked with a variety
of federal and  
private sector stakeholders to coordinate private and public actions,
began harmonizing data  
standards, and worked to advance nationwide health information exchange.
In 2009, the National  
Coordinator position, office, and statutory duties were codified by the
Health Information  
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), enacted as
part of the  
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5, enacted
February 17, 2009),  
at Title 42—Health Information Technology and Quality (42 U.S.C. 300jj
*et seq.*) of the Public  
Health Service Act (PHSA). Under section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA, ONC
established a  
voluntary certification program to certify that health IT met standards,
implementation  
specifications, and certification criteria adopted by the Secretary. ONC
is organizationally  
located within HHS’ Office of the Secretary and is the principal federal
entity charged with  
coordination of nationwide efforts to implement and use the most
advanced health IT and the  
electronic exchange of health information. ****  
  
The HITECH Act provided the opportunity to move interoperability forward
in many  
additional meaningful ways. A few are particularly worth noting in
relation to this proposed rule.  
For instance, HITECH also amended the Social Security Act (the Act),
authorizing CMS to make  
incentive payments (and in later years, make downward adjustments to
Medicare payments) to  
eligible professionals, eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals
(CAHs), and MA  

-----

****

**10**  
organizations to promote the adoption and meaningful use of certified
electronic health record  
technology (CEHRT). In 2010, through rulemaking, we established criteria
for the Medicare and  
Medicaid Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs to encourage
eligible  
professionals, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to adopt, implement,
upgrade, and demonstrate the  
meaningful use of CEHRT. The programs were implemented in three
stages:  
● Stage 1 set the foundation for the EHR Incentive Programs by
establishing  
requirements for the electronic capture of clinical data, including
providing patients with  
electronic copies of health information.  
● Stage 2 expanded upon the Stage 1 criteria with a focus on advancing
clinical  
processes and ensuring that the meaningful use of EHRs supported the
aims and priorities of the  
National Quality Strategy. Stage 2 criteria encouraged the use of CEHRT
for continuous quality  
improvement at the point of care and the exchange of information in the
most structured format  
possible.  
● Stage 3 focuses on using CEHRT to improve health outcomes. ****  
  
The federal government has spent over $35 billion under the EHR
Incentive Programs to  
incentivize the adoption and meaningful use of EHR systems by eligible
professionals, eligible  
hospitals, and CAHs; however, despite the fact that 78 percent of
physicians[1](CMSs.html#10) and 96 percent of  
hospitals[2](CMSs.html#10)now use a certified EHR system, progress on
system-wide data sharing has been  
limited.  
  
In 2010, under the HITECH Act, ONC adopted an initial set of standards,
implementation  
specifications, and certification criteria, and established the
Temporary Certification Program for  
  
1 ONC, *Health IT Dashboard*, “Office-based Physician Health IT
Adoption: State rates of physician EHR adoption,  
health information exchange & interoperability, and patient engagement
(2015),”  
<https://dashboard.healthit.gov/apps/physician-health-it-adoption.php>(last
accessed July 9, 2018).  
2 ONC, *Health IT Dashboard*, “Non-federal Acute Care Hospital Health IT
Adoption and Use: State rates of non-  
federal acute care hospital EHR adoption, health information exchange
and interoperability, and patient
engagement  
(2015),”<https://dashboard.healthit.gov/apps/hospital-health-it-adoption.php>(last
accessed July 9, 2018).

Health Information Technology, under which health IT developers could
begin to obtain  
certification of the EHR technology that eligible professionals,
eligible hospitals, and CAHs  
would need to adopt and use to satisfy CMS Stage 1 requirements for
demonstration of  
meaningful use of CEHRT. In January 2011, ONC replaced the Temporary
Certification  
Program with the Permanent Certification Program for Health Information
Technology (45 CFR  
part 170). The Secretary has adopted iterative editions of the set of
standards, implementation  
specifications, and certification criteria included in the Programs to
keep pace with advances in  
standards, health information exchange, and the health IT market. In
addition, this helps to  
maintain alignment with the needs of health care providers seeking to
succeed within health IT-  
linked federal programs.  
****  
In April 2015, Congress passed the Medicare Access and CHIP
Reauthorization Act of  
2015 (MACRA) (Pub. L. 114-10, enacted April 16, 2015), which declared it
a national objective  
to achieve widespread exchange of health information through
interoperable CEHRT  
nationwide. Section 106(b)(1)(B)(ii) of MACRA defines “interoperability”
as the ability of two  
or more health information systems or components to exchange clinical
and other information  
and to use the information that has been exchanged using common
standards as to provide access  
to longitudinal information for health care providers in order to
facilitate coordinated care and  
improved patient outcomes. The MACRA charges the Secretary to establish
metrics to be used to  
determine if widespread interoperability had been achieved, and the
heading of section 106(b)(2)  
of the MACRA refers to “preventing blocking the sharing of information.”
Specifically, section  
106(b)(2) of the MACRA amended section 1848(o)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act for
eligible professionals  
and section 1886(n)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act for eligible hospitals and CAHs
to require that the  
professional or hospital demonstrate that they have not knowingly and
willfully taken action to  
limit or restrict the compatibility or interoperability of CEHRT. For a
discussion of the  

-----

<span id="12"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**12**  
attestation requirements that we established and codified to support the
prevention of information  
blocking, we refer readers to the CY 2017 Quality Payment Program final
rule (81 FR 77028  
through 77035).  
  
In April 2018, we renamed the EHR Incentive Programs and the MIPS
Advancing Care  
Information performance category to the Promoting Interoperability (PI)
Programs and  
Promoting Interoperability performance category, respectively (83 FR
41635). This refocusing  
and rebranding of the initiatives is just one part of the CMS strategic
shift in focus to advancing  
health IT and interoperability. ****  
CMS appreciates the pathways Congress opened for action on
interoperability, as will be  
discussed in more detail throughout this proposed rule and has been
working diligently with  
ONC to support implementation. In addition, in order to make sure we
have as much stakeholder  
feedback on all the options CMS specifically has available to best take
advantage of this new  
opportunity to promote interoperability, over a span of several months
in 2018, we released  
interoperability Requests for Information (RFIs) in several Medicare
payment rules, including in  
the FY 2019 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) proposed rule
(83 FR 20164). While  
the Interoperability RFI in the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule was focused
primarily on how and  
whether changes to Hospital Conditions of Participation and other like
program requirements  
could impact or contribute to advancing interoperability, stakeholders
provided additional input  
that we are taking under advisement for the purposes of advancing
interoperability generally in  
this proposed rule. For example, some commenters recommended aligning
existing standards  
and adopting common standards and/or data elements across the health
care industry as a whole  
(not just focusing on providers), incentivizing the use of standards,
and removing barriers as  
possible ways to address gaps in interoperability. Commenters also
expressed support for the use  
of open APIs but cautioned CMS to consider the need to ensure health
information security.  

-----

<span id="13"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**13**  
Support was also expressed for enhancing applications that are designed
for patient, or consumer  
use, such as Blue Button 2.0 (CMS’ Medicare FFS open API for patient
access to health  
information), and the development of patient-facing consumer
applications that aggregate  
various longitudinal health information for the patient into one
location. We plan to continue to  
review the public comments we receive to help identify opportunities for
CMS to advance  
interoperability in future rulemaking and subregulatory guidance.  
CMS is also working with partners in the private sector to promote
interoperability. In  
2018, CMS began participating in the Da Vinci project, a private-sector
initiative led by Health  
Level 7 (HL7), a standards development organization. For one of the use
cases under this project  
– called “Coverage Requirements and Documentation Rules Discovery” – the
Da Vinci project  
developed a draft Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)
standard during the summer  
and fall of 2018. In June 2018, in support of the Da Vinci project, the
CMS Medicare FFS  
program began: (1) developing a prototype Documentation Requirement
Lookup Service for the  
Medicare FFS program; (2) populating it with the list of items/services
for which prior  
authorization is required by the Medicare FFS program; and (3)
populating it with the  
documentation rules for oxygen and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
(CPAP) devices.  
More information about the FFS Medicare program’s efforts to support
these Da Vinci use cases  
are available
at[go.cms.gov/MedicareRequirementsLookup.](http://go.cms.gov/MedicareRequirementsLookup)  
We encourage all payers, including but not limited to MA organizations,
Medicaid  
managed care plans and CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in
FFEs to follow CMS’s  
example and align with the Da Vinci Project to: (1) develop a similar
lookup service; (2)  
populate it with their list of items/services for which prior
authorization is required; and (3)  
populate it with the documentation rules for at least oxygen and CPAP.
By taking this step,  
health plans can join CMS in helping to build an ecosystem that will
allow providers to connect

<span id="14"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

**14**  
their EHRs or practice management systems and efficient work flows with
up-to-date  
information on which items and services require prior authorization and
what the documentation  
requirements are for various items and services under that patient’s
current plan enrollment.  
In the 8 years since the first HHS rulemakings to implement HITECH,
significant  
progress has been made in the adoption of EHRs by hospitals and
clinicians; however, progress  
on interoperability needs to be accelerated.  
In section 106(b) of MACRA, Congress declared it a national objective to
achieve  
widespread exchange of health information through interoperable
certified EHR technology  
nationwide by December 31, 2018. Not later than July 1, 2016, the
Secretary was to establish  
metrics to be used to determine if and to the extent this objective was
achieved. If the objective is  
not achieved by December 31, 2018, the Secretary must submit a report
not later than December  
31, 2019, that identifies barriers to the objective and recommends
actions that the federal  
government can take to achieve the objective. In April 2016, ONC
published the “Office of the  
National Coordinator for Health Information Technology; Medicare Access
and CHIP  
Reauthorization Act of 2015; Request for Information Regarding Assessing
Interoperability for  
MACRA” RFI (81 FR 20651). Based on stakeholder input received in
response to the RFI, ONC  
subsequently identified the following two metrics for interoperability
(see

● Measure \#1: Proportion of health care providers who are
electronically engaging in the  
following core domains of interoperable exchange of health information:
sending, receiving,  
finding (querying), and integrating information received from outside
sources.  
● Measure \#2: Proportion of health care providers who report using the
information they  
electronically receive from outside providers and sources for clinical
decision-making.

ONC recently provided an update on these metrics in its 2018 Report to
Congress -  
Annual Update on the Adoption of a Nationwide System for the Electronic
Use and Exchange of  
Health Information (s[ee
https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2018-12/2018-](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2018-12/2018-HITECH-report-to-congress.pdf)  
[HITECH-report-to-congress.pdf)](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2018-12/2018-HITECH-report-to-congress.pdf).
ONC will continue to evaluate nationwide performance  
according to the identified metrics, and believes current developments,
such as policy changes  
being implemented under the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) (Pub. L.
114-255, enacted  
December 13, 2016) will contribute to increasingly improved performance
under these metrics.  
In addition, the Cures Act included provisions to advance
interoperability and health  
information exchange, including, for example, enhancements to ONC’s
Health IT certification  
program and a definition of “information blocking” (as discussed further
in section VIII. of this  
proposed rule). These provisions have been addressed in depth in ONC’s
proposed rule “21st  
Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC
Health IT Certification  
Program” (published elsewhere in this **Federal Register**).  
Section 4003 of the Cures Act added a definition of “interoperability”
as paragraph 10 of  
section 3000 of the PHSA (42 U.S.C. 300jj (9)) (as amended). Under
section 3000 of the PHSA,  
‘interoperability’, with respect to health IT, means technology that
enables the secure exchange  
of electronic health information with, and use of electronic health
information from, other health  
IT without special effort on the part of the user. It also allows for
complete access, exchange,  
and use of all electronically accessible health information for
authorized use under applicable  
state or federal law and does not constitute information blocking as
defined in section 3022(a) of  
the PHSA. ****  
  
This definition aligns with the definition under MACRA and the HHS
vision and strategy  
for achieving a health information ecosystem within which all
individuals and their health care  
providers are able to send, receive, find, and use electronic health
information in a manner that is  

-----

<span id="16"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**16**  
appropriate, secure, timely, and reliable to support the health and
wellness of individuals through  
informed shared decision-making, as well as through patient choice of
health plans and  
providers. Accordingly, except where we further or otherwise specify for
a specific policy or  
purpose, when we use the term “interoperability” within this proposed
rule we are referring to  
the definition in section 3000 of the PHSA. ****  
E. Challenges and Barriers to Interoperability  
Through significant stakeholder feedback, we understand that there are
many barriers to  
interoperability which have obstructed progress over the years. We have
conducted stakeholder  
meetings and roundtables; solicited comments via RFIs; and received
additional feedback  
through letters and rulemaking. All of this input together has
contributed to our proposals in this  
proposed rule. Some of the main barriers shared with us are addressed in
the following sections.  
While we have made efforts to address some of these barriers in this
proposed rule and through  
prior rules and actions, we believe there is still considerable work to
be done to overcome some  
of these considerable challenges toward achieving interoperability.  
1\. Patient Identifier and Interoperability  
In the Interoperability RFI in the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule (83 FR
20550), we  
solicited feedback on positive solutions to better achieve
interoperability or the sharing of health  
care information between providers. A number of commenters noted that
the lack of a unique  
patient identifier (UPI) inhibited interoperability efforts because,
without a unique identifier for  
each patient, the safe and secure electronic exchange of health
information is constrained  
because it is difficult to ensure that the relevant records are all for
the same patient.  
As part of efforts to reduce the administrative costs of providing and
paying for health  
care, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA) (Pub. L. 104-  
191, enacted August 21, 1996) required the adoption of a “unique
individual identifier for  

-----

<span id="17"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

****  
**17**  
healthcare purposes,” commonly referred to as a UPI. At the time HIPAA
was enacted, HHS  
began to consider what information would be needed to develop a rule to
adopt a UPI standard.  
An initial Notice of Intent to issue a proposed rule on requirements for
a unique health identifier  
for individuals was published in the November 2, 1998 **Federal
Register** (63 FR 61773-61774).  
Such an identifier has the potential to facilitate the accurate
portability of health  
information by allowing correct patient matching because the universal
identifier allows for  
accurate and timely patient record linking between providers across the
care continuum and it  
allows a patient’s complete record to easily move with them from
provider to provider. However,  
stakeholders immediately raised significant concerns regarding the
impact of this UPI on health  
information security and privacy. Stakeholders were concerned that if
there was a single  
identifier used across systems, it would be easier for that information
to be compromised,  
exposing protected health information (PHI) more easily than in the
current medical record  
environment that generally requires linking several pieces of personally
identifying information  
to link health records.  
The National Committee on Vital Health Statistics (NCVHS), the statutory
public  
advisory body to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the
Secretary) for health data,  
statistics, privacy, and national health information policy and HIPAA,
conducted extensive  
hearings in the first year after HIPAA was enacted to evaluate this and
other HIPAA-related  
implementation issues. The NCVHS First Annual Report to the Congress on
the Implementation  
of the Administrative Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance
Portability and  
Accountability Act, February 3, 1998, outlines the NCVHS’ efforts to
obtain feedback on the  
UP[I
(https://ncvhs.hhs.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yr1-rpt-508.pdf)](https://ncvhs.hhs.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yr1-rpt-508.pdf).
Through this process,  
NCVHS found a lack of consensus on how best to define a UPI and
controversy around the use  
of a UPI due to privacy and data security concerns. Those in favor of
adopting a UPI believe a  

-----

<span id="18"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**18**  
UPI is the most efficient way to foster information sharing and accurate
patient record linking,  
where those against it are concerned about patient privacy and data
security. NCVHS found  
these privacy and data security concerns outweighed the benefits of a
UPI.  
The NCVHS recommended that the Secretary not move forward with a
proposed rule on  
a patient identifier until further discussions could be had to fully
understand the privacy and data  
security concerns, as well as the full breadth of options beyond a
single identifier. NCVHS  
suggested the Secretary work to maximize public participation in
soliciting a variety of options  
for establishing an identifier or an alternative approach for
identifying individuals and linking  
health information of individuals for health purposes.  
Appreciating the significant concerns raised by stakeholders regarding
implementing a  
UPI, Congress included language in the Omnibus Consolidated and
Emergency Supplemental  
Appropriations Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277, enacted October 21, 1998)
and in each subsequent  
Appropriations bill, stating “None of the funds made available in this
Act may be used to  
promulgate or adopt any final standard under section 1173(b) of the Act
(42 U.S.C. 1320d–2(b))  
providing for, or providing for the assignment of, a unique health
identifier for an individual  
(except in an individual’s capacity as an employer or a health care
provider), until legislation is  
enacted specifically approving the standard.” This language has
effectively prohibited HHS from  
engaging in rulemaking to adopt a UPI standard. Consequently, the
Secretary withdrew the  
Notice of Intent to pursue rulemaking on this issue on August 9,
2000  
[(https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=200010\&RIN=0938-AI91).](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=200010&RIN=0938-AI91)  
In recent years, concerns regarding the privacy and security of
information have only  
increased. For example, in the first quarter through third quarter of FY
2018 (October 1, 2017  
through June 30, 2018), 276 breach incidents were reported to the HHS
Office of Civil Rights  
(OCR) affecting 4,341,595 individuals
[(https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach\_report.jsf)](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf).

**19**  
Although the appropriations language regarding the UPI standard has
remained  
unchanged, in the report accompanying the 2017 appropriations bill,
Congress additionally  
stated, “Although the Committee continues to carry a prohibition against
HHS using funds to  
promulgate or adopt any final standard providing for the assignment of a
unique health identifier  
for an individual until such activity is authorized, the Committee notes
that this limitation does  
not prohibit HHS from examining the issues around patient matching.
Accordingly, the  
Committee encouraged the Secretary, acting through ONC and CMS, to
provide technical  
assistance to private-sector led initiatives to develop a coordinated
national strategy that will  
promote patient safety by accurately identifying patients to their
health information.” (H.R. Rep.  
No. 114–[699, p. 110,
https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114hrpt699/pdf/CRPT-](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114hrpt699/pdf/CRPT-114hrpt699.pdf)  
[114hrpt699.pdf)](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114hrpt699/pdf/CRPT-114hrpt699.pdf).
Congress has repeated this guidance for 2018 and 2019. This guidance
directed  
HHS to focus on examining issues around patient matching and to provide
technical assistance to  
private sector-led initiatives focusing on a patient matching
solution.  
Unlike a UPI, which assigns a unique identifier – either numerical or
otherwise – to each  
patient, patient matching is a process by which health information from
multiple sources is  
compared to identify common elements, with the goal of identifying
records representing a  
single patient. This is generally done by using multiple demographic
data fields such as name,  
birth date, gender, and address. The goal of patient matching is to link
one patient’s data across  
multiple databases within and across health care providers in order to
obtain a comprehensive  
view of that patient’s health care information.  
ONC has stated that patient matching is critically important to
interoperability and the  
nation’s health IT infrastructure as health care providers must be able
to share patient health  
information and accurately match a patient to his or her data from a
different provider in order  
for many anticipated interoperability benefits to be realized.  

-----

<span id="20"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**20**  
Patient matching can be less precise than a UPI due to the reliance on
demographic  
attributes (such as name and date of birth) which are not unique traits
to a particular patient;  
further, patient matching is often dependent on manual data entry and
data maintained in varying  
formats. Matching mistakes can contribute to adverse events, compromised
safety and privacy,  
and increased health care costs (s[ee
https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/hie-](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/hie-interoperability/nationwide-interoperability-roadmap-final-version-1.0.pdf)  
[interoperability/nationwide-interoperability-roadmap-final-version-1.0.pdf)](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/hie-interoperability/nationwide-interoperability-roadmap-final-version-1.0.pdf).
However, a wide  
range of strategies and best practices currently being deployed across
the industry have been  
shown to improve patient matching rates, suggesting that patient
matching approaches can be an  
effective solution when appropriately implemented
(see  
[https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/patient\_identification\_matching\_final\_report.pdf).](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/patient_identification_matching_final_report.pdf)  
Many stakeholders commenting on the interoperability RFIs included in
the 2019  
proposed payment rules indicated that patient matching is a “core
functionality” of patient  
identification and necessary to ensure care coordination and the best
patient outcomes.  
Commenters also noted that a consistently used matching strategy could
accomplish the original  
goals of a UPI with a diminished risk to individual privacy and health
information security.  
Several commenters noted that the lack of a UPI impacted
interoperability, but finding a  
suitable and consistent matching strategy could address this issue.
These commenters often  
specifically supported Congress’ guidance to have ONC and CMS provide
technical assistance to  
the private sector to identify this strategy. To help jump start the
process of finding a solution to  
patient matching, ONC launched the Patient Matching Algorithm Challenge
in 2017, awarding  
six winners $75,000 in grants in late
2017  
[(https://www.patientmatchingchallenge.com/challenge-information/challenge-details)](https://www.patientmatchingchallenge.com/challenge-information/challenge-details).
The goal  
of the Patient Matching Algorithm Challenge was to bring about greater
transparency and data  
on the performance of existing patient matching algorithms, spur the
adoption of performance  

-----

<span id="21"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

****  
**21**  
metrics for patient data matching algorithm vendors, and positively
impact other aspects of  
patient matching such as deduplication and linking to clinical data.  
We continue to support ONC’s work promoting the development of patient
matching  
initiatives. Per Congress’ guidance, ONC is looking at innovative ways
to provide technical  
assistance to private sector-led initiatives to further develop accurate
patient matching solutions  
in order to promote interoperability without requiring a UPI.  
We understand the significant health information privacy and security
concerns raised  
around the development of a UPI standard and the current prohibition
against using HHS funds  
to adopt a UPI standard. Recognizing Congress’ statement regarding
patient matching and  
stakeholder comments stating that a patient matching solution would
accomplish the goals of a  
UPI, we seek comment for future consideration on ways for ONC and CMS to
continue to  
facilitate private sector efforts on a workable and scalable patient
matching strategy so that the  
lack of a specific UPI does not impede the free flow of information. We
also seek comment on  
how we may leverage our program authority to provide support to those
working to improve  
patient matching. In addition, we intend to use comments for the
development of policy and  
future rulemaking.  
2\. Lack of standardization  
  
Lack of standardization inhibits the successful exchange of health
information without  
additional effort on the part of the end user. To achieve secure
exchange of health information  
across health IT products and systems that can be readily used without
special effort by the user,  
both the interface technology and the underlying data must be
standardized, so all systems are  
“speaking the same language.” Consistent use of modern computing
standards and applicable  
content standards (such as clinical vocabularies) are fundamental to
achieving full-scale  
technical interoperability (systems can connect and exchange data
unaltered) and semantic  

-----

<span id="22"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**22**  
interoperability (systems can interpret and use the information that has
been exchanged). Lack of  
such standards creates a barrier to interoperability. Where specific
standards are not consistently  
used, particularly to structure exchange interfaces such as APIs, the
exchange is more difficult  
and expensive than it needs to be and the recipient of exchanged data
must often undertake  
substantial special effort to make sense of the information.  
In this proposed rule, similar to CMS’ Blue Button 2.0 approach for
Medicare FFS[3](CMSs.html#22), we  
propose to require that all MA organizations, Medicaid managed care
plans, CHIP managed care  
entities, Medicaid state agencies, CHIP agencies that operate FFS
systems, and issuers of QHPs  
in the FFEs, deploy standardized, open APIs to make certain information
available to enrollees  
as discussed in section III. of this proposed rule.  
The lack of a sufficiently mature API functionality technical standard
has posed a  
challenge and impediment to advancing interoperability. In 2015, ONC
finalized an API  
functionality certification criterion in the “2015 Edition Health
Information Technology (Health  
IT) Certification Criteria, 2015 Edition Base Electronic Health Record
(EHR) Definition, and  
ONC Health IT Certification Program Modifications” Final Rule (2015
Edition final rule) (80  
FR 62602). However, while a consensus technical standard specific to the
API technical  
functionality was in development, it had not yet matured enough for
inclusion in the 2015  
Edition final rule, which does not identify a specific standard for API
functionality.  
As discussed in greater detail in section II of this proposed rule, we
believe that a specific  
foundational standard for API functionality has matured sufficiently
enough for ONC to propose  
it for HHS adoption (published elsewhere in this **Federal Register**).
To take full advantage of  
this proposed standard, as well as already adopted standards applicable
to content exchanged via  
APIs, we propose in sections II. and III. of this proposed rule to
require that MA organizations,

****  
**23**  
Medicaid managed care plans, Medicaid state agencies, CHIP managed care
entities, CHIP  
agencies that operate FFS systems, and QHP issuers in FFEs deploy API
technologies  
conformant with the API technical standard proposed by ONC for HHS
adoption at 45 CFR  
170.215 and other applicable standards such as content and vocabulary
standards adopted at 45  
CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.160, and proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at
45 CFR 170.213  
(published elsewhere in this **Federal Register**). Furthermore, we note
that we intend to continue  
to work with stakeholders to develop standards that will advance
interoperability.  
3\. Information Blocking  
As explained above, information blocking is defined in section 3022(a)
of the PHSA.  
Understanding this definition, information blocking could be considered
to include the practice  
of withholding data, or intentionally taking action to limit or restrict
the compatibility or  
interoperability of health IT. Through stakeholder outreach,
roundtables, and letters we have  
received, we understand that health care providers may limit or prevent
data exchange in an  
effort to retain patients. By withholding a patient’s health information
from competing health  
care providers, a health care provider can effectively inhibit a patient
from freely moving within  
the health care market because that patient would not otherwise have
access to their complete  
health information.  
We additionally understand from stakeholder feedback that in certain
cases a health IT  
vendor has prohibited the movement of data from one health IT system to
another in an effort to  
maintain their customer base.  
Information blocking is a significant threat to interoperability and can
limit the ability for  
providers to coordinate care and treat a patient based on the most
comprehensive information  
available. In sections VIII.B. and C. of this proposed rule we propose
to publicly report the  
names of clinicians and hospitals who submit a “no” response to certain
attestation statements  

-----

<span id="24"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

****  
**24**  
related to the prevention of information blocking in order to deter
health care providers from  
engaging in conduct that could be considered information blocking.  
Preventing and avoiding information blocking is important to advancing
interoperability.  
We believe this proposal would help discourage health care providers
from information blocking  
and clearly indicates CMS’s commitment to preventing such practices.  
4\. Lack of adoption/use of certified health IT among post-acute care
(PAC) providers  
PAC facilities are critical in the care of patients’ post-hospital
discharge, and can be a  
determining step in the health progress for those
patients.[4](CMSs.html#24) Interoperable health IT can improve  
the ability of these facilities to coordinate and provide care; however,
long-term care and PAC  
providers, such as nursing homes, home health agencies (HHAs), long-term
care providers, and  
others, were not eligible for the EHR Incentive Programs under the
HITECH Act. Based on the  
information we have, we understand that this was a contributing factor
to these providers not  
adopting CEHRT at the same rate as eligible hospitals and physicians,
who were able to adopt  
CEHRT using the financial incentives provided under the
programs.[5](CMSs.html#24),[6](CMSs.html#24)  
While a majority of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) used an EHR in
2016 (64 percent),  
there is considerable work to be done to increase adoption and the
exchange of data in this  
provider population. In that same year, only three out of 10 SNFs
electronically exchanged (that  
is, sent or received) key clinical health information, and only 7
percent had the ability to  
electronically send, receive, find, and integrate patient health
information. In 2017, an ONC  
survey found that more HHA) (78 percent) adopted EHRs than SNFs (66
percent), but  
integration of received information continued to lag behind for both
HHAs (36 percent) and

SNFs (18 percent). While both ONC surveys focused on SNFs, it is
important to note the large  
provider overlap between SNFs and other nursing facilities. In 2014,
14,409 out of 15,640 (92  
percent) of nursing homes were certified for both Medicare and
Medicaid.[7](CMSs.html#25)  
Long-term hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), SNFs,
and HHAs are  
required to submit to CMS standardized patient assessment data described
in section  
1899B(b)(1) of the Act (as added by section 2(a) of the Improving
Medicare Post-Acute Care  
Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act) (Pub. L. 113-185, enacted
October 6, 2014)). We  
have defined the term “standardized patient assessment data” (or
“standardized resident  
assessment data” for purposes of SNFs) as patient or resident assessment
questions and response  
options that are identical in all four PAC assessment instruments, and
to which identical  
standards and definitions apply. Section 1899B(b)(1)(B) of the Act
states that the categories for  
which standardized patient or resident assessment data must be submitted
include, at a minimum,  
functional status; cognitive function; medical conditions and
co-morbidities; special services,  
treatments and interventions; and impairments. Section 1899B(b)(1)(A) of
the Act requires that  
such data must be submitted through the applicable reporting provision
that applies to each PAC  
provider type using the PAC assessment instrument that applies to the
PAC provider. Section  
1899B(a)(1)(B) of the Act additionally requires that these data be
standardized and interoperable  
so as to allow for their exchange among health care providers, including
PAC providers, to  
ensure coordinated care and improved Medicare beneficiary outcomes as
these patients transition  
throughout the care continuum. To enable the interoperable exchange of
such information, we  
have adopted certain patient assessment data elements as standardized
patient or resident  
assessment data and mapped them to appropriate health IT standards which
can support the

exchange of this information. For more information, we refer the reader

https://del.cms.gov/DELWeb/pubHome.  
5\. Privacy Concerns and HIPAA  
The Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules under HIPAA (45 CFR
parts 160  
and 164) support interoperability by providing assurance to the public
that PHI as defined in 45  
CFR 160.103 is maintained securely and shared only for appropriate
purposes or with express  
authorization of the individual. For more than a decade, the HIPAA Rules
have provided a  
strong privacy and security foundation for the health care system.
However, we have heard that  
lack of harmonization between federal and state privacy and security
standards can create  
uncertainty or confusion for HIPAA covered entities that want to
exchange health information.  
Resources about how the HIPAA Rule permits health care providers and
health plans to share  
health information using health IT for purposes like treatment or care
coordination is available

Although barriers to interoperability do exist, HHS and private industry
are actively  
working to address them. On June 6, 2018, the HHS Deputy Secretary
initiated the Regulatory  
Sprint to Coordinated Care (RS2CC). In support of this effort, the HHS
Office of Inspector  
General (OIG) released an RFI on barriers to coordinated care or
value-based care, which was  
out for public comment through October 26, 2018 (83 FR 43607). Together,
CMS and ONC are  
working to address information blocking via rulemaking. We are actively
working to improve  
data standardization, particularly through the use of APIs. And, we are
using available policy  
levers to encourage greater adoption of EHR technology and
interoperability among PAC  
providers. We provide resources to help providers see how HIPAA and
interoperability work

together. And, we are leveraging private sector relationships to find
patient matching solutions in  
lieu of a patient identifier.  
F. Summary of Major Provisions ****  
To empower beneficiaries of Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs and enrollees
in MA  
organizations, Medicaid and CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers
in the FFEs (when  
mentioned throughout this proposed rule, this includes QHPs certified by
FFEs regardless of  
whether enrollees enroll through the FFE or off the FFE), we are
proposing several initiatives to  
break down the barriers that impede patients’ ease of access to their
electronic health care  
information; we propose to create and implement new mechanisms for them
to access to their  
own health care information, as well as the ability to decide how, when,
and with whom to share  
their information. We are proposing to require that a variety of
information be made accessible to  
these impacted patients via “openly published” (or simply “open”) APIs–
that is, APIs for which  
the technical and other information required for a third-party
application to connect to them is  
publicly available. This will provide these patients with convenient
access to their health care  
information in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule access standard at
45 CFR 164.524, and  
an increase in their choice of applications with which to access and use
their own electronic  
health information, as discussed above, and other information relevant
to managing their health,  
enabling open APIs to improve competition and choice as they have in
other industries. We  
propose to require MA organizations, Medicaid state agencies, state CHIP
agencies, Medicaid  
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs
to implement open  
APIs consistent with the API technical standards proposed by ONC for
adoption by HHS and to  
use content and vocabulary standards adopted by HHS at 45 CFR part 162
and 42 CFR 423.160,  
and proposed by ONC for adoption by HHS at 45 CFR 170.213 (published
elsewhere in this  
**Federal Register**)).

Effective coordination and appropriate sharing of enrollee information
between health  
plans can reduce the need for providers to write duplicative letters of
medical necessity, or it  
could reduce instances of subjecting beneficiaries to unnecessary
repetition of step therapy, or  
repeated utilization reviews, risk screenings and assessments. It could
also help to streamline  
prior authorization procedures or reduce instances where the clinician
might need to intervene  
personally with a payer to ensure his or her patient received the
treatment necessary. We are  
proposing to require payers to support beneficiaries in coordinating
their own care via payer to  
payer care coordination. In addition to existing care coordination
efforts between plans, we  
propose that a plan must, if asked by the beneficiary, forward his or
her information to a new  
plan or other entity designated by the beneficiary for up to 5 years
after the beneficiary has  
disenrolled with the plan. Such transactions would be made in compliance
with applicable laws.  
We are proposing a requirement for MA Plans, Medicaid and CHIP Managed
Care entities  
(MCOs, PIHPs, PAHPs), and QHP issuers in FFEs to coordinate care between
plans by  
exchanging, at a minimum, the data elements in the United States Core
Data for Interoperability  
(USCDI) standard[8](CMSs.html#28) at enrollee request at specified
times.  
We believe that payers’ ability to share enrollee claims, encounter
data, utilization  
history, and clinical health information they may have for their
enrollees with one another, as  
well as their ability to share that information with patients and health
care providers, when  
approved by the patient and appropriate under applicable law, using
interoperable electronic  
means will considerably improve patient access to information, reduce
provider burden, and  
reduce redundant and otherwise unnecessary data-related policies and
procedures. We are  
proposing to require that all MA organizations, Medicaid and CHIP
Managed Care entities  
(MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs), and QHP issuers in FFEs (with the exception of
stand-alone dental

plans (SADPs)) must participate in a trusted health information exchange
network meeting  
criteria for interoperability. Further, we discuss an approach to
payer-to-payer and payer-to-  
provider interoperability which leverages such existing trusts
networks.  
States and CMS routinely exchange data to support the administration of
benefits to  
Medicare-Medicaid dually eligible beneficiaries. This includes “buy-in”
data on who is enrolled  
in Medicare, and who is liable for paying the dual eligible
beneficiary’s Part A and B premiums.  
Buy-in data exchanges support state, CMS, and Social Security
Administration (SSA) premium  
accounting, collections, and enrollment functions. This also includes
“MMA” data on dual  
eligibility status (called the “MMA file” after the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and  
Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108-173, enacted December 8,
2003)), which are  
used in all four Parts of Medicare. We are proposing to establish
frequency requirements to  
require all states to participate in daily exchange of buy-in data with
CMS by April 1, 2022, and  
to update frequency requirements to require all states to submit MMA
file data to CMS daily by  
April 1, 2022.  
We are actively working with our partners throughout HHS to deter the
practice of  
information blocking. We believe it would benefit patients to know if
their health care providers  
attested negatively to any of the prevention of information blocking
attestation statements under  
the Quality Payment Program (QPP) or the Medicare FFS Promoting
Interoperability Program.  
In previous testing with patients and caregivers, we have learned that
effective use of CEHRT is  
important to them when making informed health care decisions. To address
this issue, we are  
proposing to publicly post information about negative attestations on
appropriate CMS websites.  
Section 4003 of the Cures Act recognized the importance of making
provider digital  
contact information available through a common directory. To facilitate
this, CMS has updated  
the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) to be able to
capture this digital  

-----

<span id="30"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**30**  
contact information. Now that the systems are in place, we seek to
increase the number of  
clinicians with valid and current digital contact information available
through NPPES. We are  
proposing to publicly identify those clinicians who have not submitted
digital contact  
information in NPPES. Further, we are proposing to align program
requirements for MA  
organizations, Medicaid state agencies, Medicaid managed care plans,
CHIP agencies that  
operate FFS systems, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs
(with the exception  
of issuers of SADPs) such that each payer/plan issuer would make
provider directory  
information publicly available via an API.  
Electronic patient event notifications from hospitals, or clinical event
notifications, are  
widely recognized as an effective tool for improving care coordination
across settings, especially  
for patients at admission, discharge, and transfer. We are proposing to
revise the conditions of  
participation for hospitals (including short-term acute care hospitals,
long-term care hospitals  
(LTCHs), rehabilitation hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, children’s
hospitals, and cancer  
hospitals) and CAHs to require that these entities send patient event
notifications to another  
health care facility or to another community provider. We propose to
limit this requirement to  
only those Medicare- and Medicaid-participating hospitals and CAHs that
possess EHRs systems  
with the technical capacity to generate information for electronic
patient event notifications.  
We also plan to test ways to promote interoperability across the health
care spectrum  
through models tested by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation
("Innovation  
Center"). Innovation Center models offer a unique opportunity to engage
with health care  
providers and other entities in innovative ways and to test concepts
that have the ability to  
accelerate change in the U.S. health care system, including to promote
interoperability. As such,  
we are soliciting public comment on general principles around
interoperability within Innovation  
Center models for integration into new models, through provisions in
model participation  

-----

<span id="31"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**31**  
agreements or other governing documents. In applying these general
principles, we intend to be  
sensitive to the details of individual model design, and the
characteristics and capacities of the  
participants in each specific model.  
One of the many proposals we considered but did not include in this
proposed rule was a  
proposal to make updates to the Promoting Interoperability Program
(formerly the Medicare and  
Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs) to encourage eligible hospitals and
CAHs to engage in  
certain activities focused on interoperability. This concept was
initially introduced in a request  
for public comment in the FY 2019 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (83 FR
20537 through  
20538). We discussed a possible future strategy in which we would create
a set of priority health  
IT or “interoperability” activities that would serve as alternatives to
measures in the Promoting  
Interoperability Program. We discussed creating a set of priority health
IT activities with a focus  
on interoperability and simplification to reduce health care provider
burden while allowing  
flexibility to pursue innovative applications of health IT to improve
care delivery. We offered  
three different examples of activities which might be included under
such an approach,  
including:  
● Participation in, or serving as, a health information network which is
part of the  
Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA);  
● Maintaining an open API which allows persistent access to third
parties which enables  
patients to access their health information; and  
● Participating in piloting and testing of new standards that support
emerging  
interoperability use cases.  
While we are not proposing this here, we expect to introduce a proposal
for establishing  
“interoperability activities” in the FY 2020 IPPS/LTCH PPS rulemaking in
conjunction with  
other updates to the Promoting Interoperability Program. To help inform
future rulemaking, we  

-----

<span id="32"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**32**  
invite comments on the concepts discussed above, as well as other ideas
for “interoperability  
activities” for which eligible hospitals and CAHs could receive credit
in lieu of reporting on  
program measures.  
Finally, we include two RFIs. One related to interoperability and health
IT adoption in  
PAC settings, and one related to the role of patient matching in
interoperability and improved  
patient care.  
**II. Technical Standards Related to Interoperability**  
A. Technical Approach and Standards  
1\. Use of FHIR for APIs  
The MACRA defines interoperability as the ability of two or more health
information  
systems or components to exchange clinical and other information and to
use the information  
that has been exchanged using common standards such as to provide access
to longitudinal  
information for health care providers in order to facilitate coordinated
care and improved patient  
outcomes. Interoperability is also defined in section 3000 of the Public
Health Service Act  
(PHSA) (42 U.S.C. 300jj), as amended by section 4003 of the Cures Act.
Under that definition,  
“interoperability”, with respect to health IT, means such health IT that
enables the secure  
exchange of electronic health information with, and use of electronic
health information from,  
other health IT without special effort on the part of the user; allows
for complete access,  
exchange, and use of all electronically accessible health information
for authorized use under  
applicable state or federal law; and does not constitute information
blocking as defined in section  
3022(a) of the PHSA, which was added by section 4004 of the Cures Act.
We believe the PHSA  
definition is consistent with the MACRA definition of interoperability.
As noted at the outset of  
this proposed rule, for the purposes of this proposed rule and this
specific section, we will use the  
PHSA definition.  

-----

<span id="33"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**33**  
We believe the PHSA definition of interoperability is useful as a
foundational reference  
for our approach to advancing interoperability and exchange of
electronic health information for  
individuals throughout the United States, and across the entire spectrum
of provider types and  
care settings with which health plan issuers and administrators need to
efficiently exchange  
multiple types of relevant data. We note the PHSA definition of
interoperability is not applied  
only to a specific program or initiative but to all activities under the
title of the PHSA that  
establishes ONC’s responsibilities to support and shape the health
information ecosystem,  
including exchange infrastructure for the United States health care
system as a whole. The PHSA  
definition of interoperability is also consistent with HHS’s vision and
strategies for achieving a  
health information ecosystem within which all individuals, their
families, and health care  
providers are able to send, receive, find, and use electronic health
information in a manner that is  
appropriate, secure, timely, and reliable to support the health and
wellness of individuals through  
informed, shared decision-making,[9](CMSs.html#33)as well as to support
consumer choice of health plans and  
providers.  
A core policy principle we aim to support across all proposals in this
proposed rule is that  
every American should be able, without special effort or advanced
technical skills, to see, obtain,  
and use all electronically available information that is relevant to
their health, care, and choices –  
of plans, providers, and specific treatment options. This includes two
types of information:  
information specifically about the individual that requires appropriate
diligence to protect the  
individual’s privacy, such as their current and past medical conditions
and care received, as well  
as information that is of general interest and should be widely
available, such as plan provider  
networks, the plan’s formulary, and coverage policies.

Shared Nationwide Interoperability  
Roadmap” Final Version 1.0 (2015):

While many consumers today can often access their own electronic health
information  
through patient/enrollee portals and proprietary applications made
available by various providers  
and health plans, they must typically go through separate processes to
obtain access to each  
system, and often need to manually aggregate information that is
delivered in various, often non-  
standardized, formats. The complex tasks of accessing and piecing
together this information can  
be burdensome and frustrating to consumers.  
In contrast, consider the ease with which consumers can choose and use a
navigation  
application which integrates information on their current location,
preferences, and real-time  
traffic conditions to choose the best route to a chosen destination.
Consumers do not have to log  
into a different “location” portal to learn their current geographic
coordinates, write them down,  
and then log into a separate “map” portal to enter their current
coordinates to request directions  
to their destination.  
An API can be thought of as a set of commands, functions, protocols, or
tools published  
by one software developer (“A”) that enable other software developers to
create programs  
(applications or “apps”) that can interact with A’s software without
needing to know the internal  
workings of A’s software, all while maintaining consumer privacy data
standards. This is how  
API technology enables the seamless user experiences associated with
applications familiar from  
other aspects of many consumers’ daily lives, such as travel and
personal finance. Standardized,  
transparent, and pro-competitive API technology can enable similar
benefits to consumers of  
health care services.[10](CMSs.html#34)  
While acknowledging the limits of our authority to require use of APIs
to address our  
goals for interoperability and data access, we are proposing in this
rule to use our programmatic  
  
10 ONC has made available a succinct, non-technical overview of APIs in
context of consumers’ access to their own  
medical information across multiple providers’ EHR systems, which is
available at the HealthIT.gov website
at  
[https://www.healthit.gov/api-education-module/story\_html5.html.](https://www.healthit.gov/api-education-module/story_html5.html)

**35**  
authority in Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and over QHPs in FFEs to advance
these goals.  
Therefore, we are proposing to require that a variety of data be made
accessible to MA enrollees,  
Medicaid beneficiaries, CHIP enrollees, and enrollees in QHPs in FFEs,
by requiring that MA  
organizations, Medicaid state agencies, Medicaid managed care plans,
CHIP agencies, CHIP  
managed care entities, and QHPs in FFEs, adopt and implement “openly
published” (or simply  
“open”) APIs. Having certain data available through open APIs would
allow these enrollees to  
use the application of their choice to access and use their own
electronic health information and  
other information relevant to managing their health.  
Much like our efforts under the Medicare Blue Button 2.0 and
MyHealthEData  
initiatives, which made Parts A, B, and D claims data available to
Medicare beneficiaries, our  
proposal would result in claims and coverage information being
accessible for the vast majority  
of Medicare beneficiaries by requiring MA organizations to take new
steps – by implementing  
the API described in this proposed rule – to make claims data available
to their enrollees. We  
expect that our proposal would also benefit all Medicaid beneficiaries
because our proposal  
applies to Medicaid state agencies (which administer Medicaid FFS
programs), and all types of  
Medicaid managed care plans (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs), and CHIP agencies
(which  
administer CHIP FFS) and CHIP managed care entities (MCOs, PIHPs, and
PAHPs). Finally,  
while our proposal is only applicable to QHPs in FFEs, we hope that
states operating Exchanges  
might consider adopting similar requirements for QHPs in State-Based
Exchanges (SBEs), and  
that other payers in the private sector might consider voluntarily
offering data accessibility of the  
type included in this proposal so that even more patients across the
American health care system  
can easily have and use such information to advance their choice and
participation in their health  
care. We hope that the example being set by CMS will raise consumers’
expectations and

**36**  
encourage other payers in the market to take similar steps to advance
patient access and  
empowerment outside the scope of our proposed requirements.  
An “open API,” for purposes of this proposed rule, is simply one for
which the technical  
and other information required for a third-party application to connect
to it is openly published.  
Open API does not imply any and all applications or application
developers would have  
unfettered access to people’s personal or sensitive information. Rather,
an open API’s published  
technical and other information specifically includes what an
application developer would need  
to know to connect to and obtain data available through the API.  
We recommend reviewing the discussion of the standardized API criterion
and associated  
policy principles and technical standards included in ONC’s proposed
rule “21st Century Cures  
Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT
Certification Program”  
(published elsewhere in this **Federal Register**) for those seeking
more detailed information on  
API functionality and interoperability standards relevant to electronic
health information. While  
that discussion is specific to health IT certified under ONC’s Health IT
Certification Program  
rather than the information systems generally used by payers and plan
issuers for claims,  
encounters, or other administrative or plan operational data, it
includes information applicable to  
interoperability standards, as well as considerations relevant to
establishing reasonable and non-  
discriminatory terms of service for applications seeking to connect to
the open API. However, it  
is important to reiterate that we are *not* proposing to require health
plan issuers to use Health IT  
Modules certified under ONC’s program to make administrative data such
as claims history or  
provider directory information available to enrollees.  
In developing this proposed rule, we considered how to advance the sort
of  
interoperability and innovation in the health system supported by open
APIs in other industries.  
We have also collaborated with ONC to align with and leverage relevant
API policies ONC has  

-----

<span id="37"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

****  
**37**  
proposed to implement Cures Act requirements. In general, we believe
three attributes of open  
APIs are particularly important to achieve the goal of offering
individuals convenient access,  
through applications they choose, to available and relevant electronic
health information. The  
three API attributes are:  
● The API technologies themselves, not just the data accessible through
them, are  
standardized;  
● The APIs are technically transparent; and  
● The APIs are implemented in a pro-competitive ** manner.  
In this section, we discuss these concepts generally and how they are
applicable in the  
health care context for all payers, as well as explain how these are
relevant to our specific  
proposals, which are discussed in detail in section III. of this
proposed rule.  
a. Standardized  
Technical consistency and implementation predictability are fundamental
to scale API-  
enabled interoperability and reduce the level and costs of custom
development otherwise  
necessary to access, exchange, and use health information. From an
industry standpoint, a  
consistent and predictable set of API functions, as well as content and
formatting standards,  
provide the health IT ecosystem with known technical requirements
against which application  
developers can build applications (including but not limited to “mobile
apps”) and other  
innovative services which users can select to access and manage the data
they need. Therefore, to  
achieve interoperability consistent with the PHSA definition, the
proposals in section III. of this  
proposed rule would effectively require that API technologies deployed
by health plans subject  
to this rule use modern computing standards (such as RESTful
interfaces[11](CMSs.html#37)and XML/JSON), and  
  
11 “RESTful interfaces” are those that are consistent with
Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style  
and communications approaches to web services development.

<span id="38"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

****  
**38**  
present the requested information using widely recognized content
standards (such as  
standardized vocabularies of clinical terms), where applicable.  
b. Transparent  
Transparency and openness around API documentation is commonplace in
many other  
industries and has fueled innovation, growth, and competition.
Documentation associated with  
APIs deployed by health care providers, health plans, and other entities
engaged in exchanging  
electronic health information typically addresses the information that
would be material to  
persons and entities that use or create software applications that
interact with the API (API  
users). Information material to API users includes, but is not
necessarily limited to, all terms and  
conditions for use of the API, including terms of service, restrictions,
limitations, obligations,  
registration process requirements, or other similar requirements that
would be needed to:  
● Develop software applications to interact with the API;  
● Connect software applications to the API to access electronic health
information  
through the API;  
● Use any electronic health information obtained by means of the API
technology; and  
● Register software applications to connect with the API.  
As discussed in section III. of this proposed rule, we are proposing
that certain entities  
(MA organizations, State Medicaid agencies, Medicaid managed care plan,
State CHIP agencies,  
CHIP managed care entities, and QHPs in FFEs), supported by the
suppliers of their API  
technology, and for the API technology they use to comply with the
requirements we propose in  
this proposed rule, be required to make freely and publicly accessible
the specific business and  
technical documentation necessary to interact with these APIs. This is
aligned with the  
requirements that ONC has proposed that the Secretary adopt for
developers and users of health  

-----

<span id="39"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****

****  
**39**  
IT certified to the API criteria proposed at 45 CFR 170.315 (published
elsewhere in this **Federal**  
**Register**).  
c. Pro-competitive  
Pro-competitive practices in selecting, configuring, and maintaining
APIs are those  
business practices that promote the efficient access to, exchange of,
and use of electronic health  
information to support a competitive marketplace that enhances consumer
value and choice of  
direct-to-consumer technology, health coverage, and care. We believe
that an ultimate goal of all  
participants in the health care ecosystem is that individuals should be
able to use an application  
they choose to connect and access, without special effort, their
electronic health information held  
by health care providers, health plans, or any health information
networks, within practical and  
prudent limits that do not needlessly hinder their ability to connect to
the API in a persistent  
manner.  
Such acceptable limits include technical compatibility and ensuring the
application does  
not pose an unacceptable level of risk to a system when connecting to an
API offered by that  
system, consistent with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and
guidance issued by the HHS  
OCR[12](CMSs.html#39), to which the Secretary delegated the authority to
enforce HIPAA privacy and security  
requirements. Organizational policies and procedures needed to comply
with any additional  
requirements under state laws that would apply in a given situation
would also be viewed as  
necessary and not anti-competitive. Examples of practices we would view
as pro-competitive  
might include proactively advising enrollees they are not required to
use only the organization’s  
own or preferred applications to access, use, and share their health
information. Such advice  
  
12 OCR enforces federal civil rights laws, conscience and religious
freedom laws, the Health Insurance Portability  
and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy, Security, and Breach
Notification Rules, and provisions of the  
Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (PSQIA) and the
Patient Safety Rule (codified at 42 CFR  
part 3 (73 FR 70732)) protecting the confidentiality and privilege of
patient safety work product as defined in  
PSQIA and 42 CFR Part 3. Thus, within HHS, OCR has lead responsibility
for interpreting, administering, and  
enforcing HIPAA regulations and developing guidance.

would be publicly available and include information relevant to the
enrollee about how they  
could request access to their information through a third-party
application of their choosing.  
We recognize that organizations subject to the open API requirements
proposed in  
section III. of this proposed rule need to take reasonable and necessary
steps to fulfill the  
organizations’ duties under all applicable laws and regulations to
protect the privacy and security  
of personally identifiable information (PII), including but not limited
to PHI under HIPAA as  
defined at 45 CFR 160.103; those privacy and security protection
obligations remain applicable  
even in the context of complying with our proposal. However, we do not
believe it is  
appropriate to use security and privacy concerns as an opportunity to
engage in anti-competitive  
practices. Anti-competitive practices might include declining to assess
the technical  
compatibility or security risk of an application provided to prospective
enrollees by a competing  
plan, despite an enrollee request to disclose their PHI to that
application through the API.  
2\. Privacy and Security Concerns in the Context of APIs ******  
We have received a wide range of stakeholder feedback on privacy and
security issues in  
response to prior proposals[13](CMSs.html#40)about policies related to
APIs that would allow consumers to use  
any app of their choosing to access PHI held by a HIPAA covered entity.
This feedback includes  
concerns about potential security risks to PHI created by an API
connecting to third-party  
applications.  
We appreciate these concerns. Deploying API technology that offers
consumers the  
opportunity to access their electronic health information that is held
by a covered entity (which  
includes but is not limited to MA organizations, the Medicare Part A and
B programs, the  
Medicaid program, CHIP, QHP issuers on the FFE, and other health plan
issuers) does not lessen  
the covered entity’s duties under HIPAA and other law to protect the
privacy and security of

Edition final rule at 80 FR 62676.

information it holds, including but not limited to PHI. A covered entity
implementing an API to  
enable individuals to access their health information must take
reasonable steps to ensure an  
individual’s information is only disclosed as permitted or required by
applicable law. The entity  
must take greater care in configuring and maintaining the security
functionalities of the API and  
the covered entities’ electronic information systems to which it
connects than would be needed if  
it was implementing an API simply to allow easier access to widely
available public information.  
HIPAA covered entities and their business associates continue to be
responsible for  
compliance with the HIPAA Rules, the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC
Act), and all other  
laws applicable to their business activities including but not limited
to their handling of  
enrollees’ PHI and other data. As we state repeatedly throughout this
proposed rule, nothing in  
this proposed rule is intended to alter or should be construed as
altering existing responsibilities  
to protect PHI under the HIPAA Rules and requirements.  
However, we note that a number of stakeholders may believe that they are
responsible for  
determining whether an application to which an individual directs their
PHI be disclosed applies  
appropriate safeguards for the information it receives. Based on the OCR
guidance discussed  
below, covered entities are not responsible under the HIPAA Rules for
the security of PHI once  
it has been received by a third-party application chosen by an
individual.  
Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule,[14](CMSs.html#41) individuals have the
right of access to inspect and  
receive a copy of a defined set of their PHI as detailed at 45 CFR
164.501. Specifically, as OCR  
has indicated in regulations and guidance, an individual can exercise
their right of access to  
direct a covered entity to send their information to a third party. When
responding to an access  
request, “the same requirements for providing the PHI to the individual,
such as the timeliness

requirements, fee limitations, prohibition on imposing unreasonable
measures, and form and  
format requirements, apply when an individual directs that the PHI be
sent to another person or  
entity.”[15](CMSs.html#42) Moreover, a covered entity may not impose
unreasonable measures on an individual  
requesting access that serve as barriers to or unreasonably delay the
individual from obtaining  
access to their PHI.[16](CMSs.html#42)  
We refer readers to further OCR guidance on related issues, including:
the liability of a  
covered entity in responding to an individual’s access request to send
the individual’s PHI to a  
third party (FAQ 2039);[17](CMSs.html#42) individuals’ rights under
HIPAA to have copies of their PHI  
transferred or transmitted to them in the manner they request, even if
the requested mode of  
transfer or transmission is unsecure (FAQ 2060);[18](CMSs.html#42)and, a
covered entity’s obligation under the  
HIPAA Breach Notification Rule if it transmits an individual’s PHI to a
third party designated by  
the individual in an access request, and the entity discovers the
information was breached in  
transit (FAQ 2040).[19](CMSs.html#42) Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as
explained in OCR’s interpretive  
guidance, “individuals have the right under HIPAA to have copies of
their PHI transferred or  
transmitted to them in the manner they request … as long as the PHI is
‘readily producible’ in  
the manner requested, based on the capabilities of the covered entity
and transmission or transfer  
in such a manner would not present an unacceptable level of security
risk to the PHI on the

covered entity’s systems, such as risks that may be presented by
connecting an outside system,  
application, or device directly to a covered entity’s systems (as
opposed to security risks to PHI  
once it has left the systems)” (HIPAA FAQ 2060).[20](CMSs.html#43)  
We have also noted stakeholder concerns about protections which apply to
non-covered  
entities such as direct-to-consumer applications. Stakeholders, as well
as covered entities who  
may be required to send PHI to these applications, have noted concerns
that unscrupulous actors  
could deploy direct-to-consumer applications specifically in order to
profit from obtaining,  
using, or disclosing individuals’ PHI (and potentially other
information) in ways the individual  
either did not authorize or to which the individual would not knowingly
consent.  
When a non–HIPAA-covered entity discloses an individual’s confidential
information in  
a manner or for a purpose not consistent with the privacy notice and
terms of use to which the  
individual agreed, the FTC has authority under the FTC Act to
investigate and take action against  
unfair or deceptive trade practices. The FTC has applied this authority
to a wide variety of  
entities. The FTC also enforces the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule,
which applies to  
certain types of entities that fall outside of the scope of HIPAA, and
therefore, are not subject to  
the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.[21](CMSs.html#43)  
We recognize that this is a complex landscape for patients, who we
anticipate will want  
to exercise due diligence on their own behalf in reviewing the terms of
service and other  
information about the applications they consider selecting. Therefore,
we propose in section III.  
of this proposed rule specific requirements on the payers subject to
these proposed regulations to  
ensure enrollees have the opportunity to become more informed about how
to protect their PHI,  
important things to consider in selecting an application, and where they
can lodge a complaint
if

they believe a HIPAA covered entity or business associate may have
breached their duties under  
HIPAA or if they believe they have been subjected to unfair or deceptive
actions or practices  
related to a direct-to-consumer application’s privacy practices or terms
of use.  
In some circumstances, information that would be required to be made
available through  
an API per an enrollee’s information request under this proposed rule –
which we view as  
consistent with the enrollee’s right of access from a covered entity
under the Privacy Rule - may  
not be readily transferable through the API. For instance, the covered
entity may not hold certain  
information electronically. However, such a scenario would in no way
limit or alter  
responsibilities and requirements under other law (including though not
limited to HIPAA  
Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules) that apply to the
organizations that would be  
subject to our proposed regulations. Even if the open API access
requirements proposed in  
section III.C. of this proposed rule were to be finalized and
implemented, the organization may  
still be called upon to respond to individuals’ request for information
not available through the  
API, or for all of their information through means other than the API.
We encourage HIPAA  
covered entities or business associates to review the OCR website for
resources on the individual  
access standard
at[https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html)  
[professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html)to
ensure they understand their responsibilities.  
3\. Specific Technical Approach and Standards  
Achieving interoperability throughout the health system is essential to
achieving an  
effective, value-conscious health system within which consumers are able
to choose from an  
array of health plans and providers. An interoperable system should
ensure that consumers can  
both easily access their electronic health information held by plans and
routinely expect that their  
claims, encounter, and other relevant health history information will
follow them smoothly from  
plan to plan and provider to provider without burdensome requirements
for them or their

****  
**45**  
providers to reassemble or re-document the information. Ready
availability of health information  
can be especially helpful when an individual cannot access their usual
source of care, for  
instance if care is needed outside their regular provider’s business
hours, while traveling, or in  
the wake of a natural disaster.  
The specific proposals within this rule as described in section III.C.2.
would impose new  
requirements on MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs,
Medicaid managed  
care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs
(excluding issuers of SADPs)  
to implement standardized, transparent APIs. Using the API, these
entities would be required to  
provide current and former enrollees with certain claims and encounter
data and certain specific  
clinical information. These entities would also be required to make
available through the API  
information already required to be widely available, such as provider
directory and plan coverage  
information. In developing our proposal delineating the information that
must be available  
through an API consistent with the proposed technical requirements, we
were guided by an intent  
to have available through the API all of the individual’s electronic
health information held by the  
plan in electronic format that is compatible with the API or that can,
through automated means,  
be accurately rendered compatible with representation through the API.
We were also guided by  
an intent to make available through standardized, transparent API
technology all of the provider  
directory and plan coverage information that is held in formats readily
compatible with the API.  
Both the API technology itself and the data it makes available must be
standardized to  
support true interoperability. Therefore, we propose in section
III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule to  
adopt both (1) content and vocabulary standards for representing
electronic health information  
and (2) technical standards for an API by which the electronic health
information must be made  
available. For the proposals described in section III.C.2.b. of this
proposed rule (which include  
purposes *other than* a HIPAA transaction, which is required to comply
with standards adopted at  

-----

<span id="46"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**46**  
45 CFR part 162), we are proposing these standards in alignment with
interoperability standards  
proposed for HHS adoption in ONC’s 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule
(published  
elsewhere in this **Federal Register**).  
In proposing to require use of specified standards by referencing CFR
text at which  
specific versions of those standards are named, we intend to preclude
regulated entities from  
implementing API technology using alternative technical standards to
those ONC proposes for  
HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215, including but not limited to proprietary
standards and other  
standards not widely used to exchange electronic health information in
the U.S. health system.  
We further intend to preclude entities from using earlier versions of
the technical standards  
adopted at 45 CFR 170.215. Likewise, by proposing to require use of the
content and vocabulary  
standards adopted at 42 CFR 423.160 and 45 CFR part 162, and proposed at
45 CFR 170.213,  
we intend to prohibit use of alternative technical standards that could
potentially be used for  
these same data classes and elements, as well as earlier versions of the
adopted standards named  
in 42 CFR 423.160, 45 CFR part 162 and proposed at 45 CFR 170.213.  
While we intend to preclude regulated entities from using content and
vocabulary  
standards other than those described in 42 CFR 423.160, 45 CFR part 162,
or proposed 45 CFR  
170.213 and 170.215, we recognize there may be circumstances which
render the use of other  
standards necessary. As discussed below, we propose to allow the use of
other standards in two  
circumstances. First, where other content or vocabulary standards are
expressly mandated by  
applicable law, we would allow for use of those other mandated
standards. Second, where no  
appropriate content or vocabulary standard exists within 45 CFR part
162, 42 CFR 423.160, or  
proposed 45 CFR 170.213 and 170.215, we would allow for use of any
suitable gap-filling  
standards, as may be applicable to the specific situation.

<span id="47"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

**47**  
We are using two separate rulemakings because ONC’s 21st Century Cures
Act proposed  
rule, which includes API interoperability standards proposed for HHS
adoption, would have  
broader reach than the scope of this proposed rule. At the same time, we
wish to assure  
stakeholders that the API standards required of MA organizations, state
Medicaid agencies, state  
CHIP agencies, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities,
and QHP issuers in  
FFEs under this proposal would be consistent with the API standards
proposed by ONC for HHS  
adoption.  
Aligning the standards requirements proposed in this rule to those
proposed by ONC for  
HHS adoption in ONC’s 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule will support
greater  
interoperability across the health care system, as health IT products
and applications that will be  
developed for different settings and use cases would be developed
according to a consistent base  
of standards that supports more seamless exchange of information. We
welcome public comment  
on the proposed alignment of standards in this proposed rule to those
proposed for adoption by  
HHS through ONC’ 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule, as well as on the
best method to  
provide support in identifying and implementing the applicable content
and vocabulary standards  
for a given data element.  
Finally, while we believe that the proposed alignment of standards
requirements in this  
proposed rule to those proposed by ONC for HHS adoption is the best
approach, we seek public  
comment on an alternative by which CMS would separately adopt the
proposed ONC standards  
identified throughout this proposed rule, as well as future
interoperability, content and  
vocabulary standards. We anticipate that any such alternative would
include incorporating by  
reference the FHIR and OAuth technical standards and the USCDI content
and vocabulary  
standard (described in sections II.A.3.b. and II.A.3.a. of this proposed
rule, respectively) into  
CMS regulation, and replacing references to ONC regulations 45 CFR
170.215, 170.213, and  

-----

<span id="48"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**48**  
170.299, respectively. However, we specifically seek comment on whether
this alternative would  
present an unacceptable risk of misalignment of standards or versions of
standards across HHS’  
programs, and an assessment of the benefits or burdens of separately
adopting new standards and  
incorporating updated versions of standards in CFR text on a program by
program basis in  
separate regulations. Furthermore, we seek comment on: how such an
option might impact health  
IT development timelines; how potential misalignment of standards over
time across HHS might  
impact system implementation; and other factors related to the technical
aspect of implementing  
these requirements.  
B. Content and Vocabulary Standards  
The HHS-adopted content and vocabulary standards applicable to the data
provided  
through the API will vary by use case and within a use case. For
instance, content and  
vocabulary standards supporting consumer access vary according to what
specific data elements  
MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed
care plans, CHIP  
managed care entities, and QHP's in FFEs have available electronically.
Where another law does  
not require use of a specific standard, we are proposing to require use
of, in effect, a catalogue of  
content and vocabulary standards from which the regulated entities may
choose in order to  
satisfy the proposed requirements in 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 457.730,
438.252, and 457.1233,  
and 45 CFR 156.221.  
We propose in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule that the
applicable entity must use  
certain content and vocabulary standards for data available through the
API, where applicable to  
the data type or data element, unless an alternate standard is required
by other applicable law.  
Specifically, we propose the applicable entity must use:  

-----

<span id="49"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**49**  
● Content and vocabulary standard ONC proposes for HHS adoption at 45
CFR 170.213  
(USCDI Version 1) where such standards are the only available standards
for the data type or  
element;  
● HIPAA Administrative Simplification transaction standards under 45 CFR
part 162 or  
the Part D e-prescribing transaction standards at 42 CFR 423.160 where
required by other  
applicable law, or where such standards are the only available standards
for the data type or  
element; or  
● Where a specific data type or element might be encoded or formatted
using either a 45  
CFR part 162 or 42 CFR 423.160 standard or the USCDI Version 1 standard
at 45 CFR 170.213,  
the applicable entity may use any of these content and vocabulary
standards as determined  
appropriate for the data type or element. We describe these proposals in
more detail below.  
First, we propose in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule to require
use of the content  
and vocabulary standard ONC proposes for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.213
as applicable to  
the data type or data element. The USCDI Version 1 data set includes
data classes that can be  
supported by commonly used standards, and establishes a minimum set of
data classes that  
would be required to be interoperable nationwide.[22](CMSs.html#49) The
USCDI is designed to be expanded in  
an iterative and predictable way over time. On behalf of HHS, ONC has
proposed to adopt the  
USCDI as a standard in its 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule
(published elsewhere in this  
**Federal Register**). The USCDI Version 1 data set proposed by ONC for
HHS adoption at 45  
CFR 170.213 also includes the standards referenced by certification
criteria adopted in 45 CFR  
part 170, to which health IT, such as Health IT Modules presented for
certification under ONC’s  
Health IT Certification Program, must conform. Developers of
applications are already familiar  
with and commonly using these standards in products that interact with
ONC-certified health IT.  
  
22 For more information on the USCDI, see
https://www.healthit.gov/USCDI.

<span id="50"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****

**50**  
The payer and purchaser communities are also aware of and commonly using
the 45 CFR part  
170 standards, and many members of these communities actively
participate in health-data-  
focused standards development organizations responsible for the creation
of these standards. As  
a result, we believe that the adoption and implementation of these
standards for CMS’ programs  
should not add new burdens to the industry. All standards adopted within
45 CFR part 170,  
including the USCDI standard ONC proposes for HHS adoption at 45 CFR
170.213, are, or are  
proposed by ONC to be incorporated by reference by HHS, at 45 CFR
170.299. (published  
elsewhere in this **Federal Register**).  
Second, we propose to require that entities use standards specified at
45 CFR part 162 for  
HIPAA transactions as required by applicable law, as well as the
standards specified at 42 CFR  
423.160 for Part D e-prescribing transactions, as required by applicable
law. We reiterate that  
this proposed rule would not alter these other regulations, and should
not be construed as altering  
any organization’s compliance requirements for these other regulations.
The standards proposed  
in this regulation are intended for instances where other statutes and
regulations do not dictate  
the standard by which regulated parties are to convey or otherwise make
available electronic  
information.  
Where there is no legally mandated standard applicable to a specific
data type or data  
element in a particular exchange context, and the HIPAA Administrative
Simplification  
transaction standards under 45 CFR part 162 or the Part D e-prescribing
transaction standards at  
42 CFR 423.160 are the only standards available for a specific data
element or type, we propose  
to require entities subject to these proposals to use these HIPAA
standards when making data  
available through the API. We further clarify that, for purposes of
formatting, making available,  
and sending electronic data under this proposed rule, we would require
use of: (1) the content  
and vocabulary standards identified in 45 CFR part 162 regardless of
whether the entities are  

-----

<span id="51"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**51**  
covered entities, and (2) the part D e-prescribing standards in 42 CFR
423.160 to exchange e-  
prescribing and related data (such as drug formulary and preferred drug
list data) regardless of  
whether they are conducting a part D e-prescribing transaction,.  
Third, in information exchanges where applicable law does not mandate a
certain  
standard and where a specific data type or element might be encoded or
formatted using the 45  
CFR part 162 or 42 CFR 423.160 standard, or the USCDI Version 1 standard
at 45 CFR  
170.213, we propose in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule that the
regulated entities subject  
to our proposal would have the freedom to provide data through the API
that complies with any  
of these format or encoding standards. Specifically, we believe payers
should use standards that  
are most efficient and effective based on their existing systems, data
mapping considerations, or  
those standards that best meets enrollees’ needs, while remaining
technically practicable for use  
in conjunction with API technology conformant to the 45 CFR 170.215
proposed standards  
(published elsewhere in this **Federal Register**), and so long as such
action is in accordance with  
applicable laws. For example, for data types for which 45 CFR part 162
standards are the only  
ones widely used throughout the payer community, and for specific
content that payers typically  
only receive according to these HIPAA standards, we believe use of the
45 CFR part 162 content  
standards to represent the information is appropriate and efficient at
this juncture. We note that  
for data made available through the API, entities subject to this
proposal would be required to  
use the standards identified in this proposal even if the exact
information to be exchanged  
through the API is also required to be available through other
mechanisms.  
Finally, we encourage payers or plans to implement additional, widely
used, consensus-  
based standards identified by other means—such as by HHS for other
purposes or through a  
consensus standards development organization—for additional data in
their information systems  
for which no standard is adopted at 45 CFR part 162, 42 CFR 423.160, or
45 CFR 170.213 to the

extent feasible, while maintaining compatibility with the required API
technical standards. We  
also encourage entities to pilot emerging standards identified by HHS,
or by a consensus  
standards development organization through development or approval for
trial use, where such a  
pilot maintains compatibility with the proposed API technical standards.
However, MA  
organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP agencies, Medicaid managed care
plans, CHIP managed  
care entities, and QHPs in FFEs that choose to make non-standardized
data available through  
their APIs would be required to ensure that their API documentation
provides sufficient  
information to an application developer for their applications to handle
this information  
accurately and automatically. We welcome public comment on these
proposals.  
C. API Standard  
In section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule, we propose to adopt a
standard for the API in  
alignment with the API technical standard proposed by ONC for HHS
adoption at 45 CFR  
170.215 (published elsewhere in this **Federal Register**). By
cross-reference to 45 CFR 170.215,  
we are effectively proposing in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule
to require use of the  
foundational Health Level 7 (HL7®)[23](CMSs.html#52)Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (FHIR®)  
standard,[24](CMSs.html#52) several implementation specifications
specific to FHIR, and complementary security  
and app registration protocols (OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Core).  
The FHIR standard holds great potential for supporting interoperability
and enabling new  
entrants and competition throughout the health care industry. FHIR
leverages modern computing  
techniques to enable users to access health care “resources” over the
internet via a standardized  
RESTful API. Developers can create tools that interact with FHIR APIs to
provide actionable  
  
23 Health Level Seven International (HL7®) is a not-for-profit,
ANSI-accredited standards development organization  
(SDO) focused on developing consensus standards for the exchange,
integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic  
health information that supports clinical practice and the management,
delivery and evaluation of health services.

data to their stakeholders. In the short time since FHIR was first
created, the health care industry  
has rapidly embraced the standard through substantial investments in
industry pilots,  
specification development, and the deployment of FHIR APIs supporting a
variety of business  
needs. With the exception of the API Resource Collection in Health
(ARCH) (proposed by ONC  
for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215(a)(2)), the API technology standards
and implementation  
specifications proposed at 45 CFR 170.215 (published elsewhere in this
**Federal Register**) are  
consensus technical standards that, under the National Technology
Transfer & Advancement Act  
of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-113, enacted March 7, 1996) and OMB Circular No.
A-119, are, where  
available and their use not impracticable, preferred for use in
government programs over both  
government-unique standards and standards developed using less rigorous
consensus processes.  
We note that while all APIs that would be used by software applications
to provide  
consumers access to their electronic health information would be
required to adhere to the  
foundational FHIR standard, and other essential standards such as
security protocols applicable  
to the data exchanged, we do not anticipate that all of the standards,
implementation  
specifications, and protocols proposed at 45 CFR 170.215 will be
directly relevant to every use  
case reflected within the policies proposed in this rule. For example,
authenticating end users’  
identities may not be needed where the information requested and
released to an application  
through the API is limited to information otherwise published, such as
provider directory  
information otherwise required by the programs’ regulations to be made
widely available.  
We note that an API implemented by regulated entities described in
section III.C. of this  
proposed rule is not required to be certified by ONC under the ONC
Health IT Certification  
Program for the related certification criteria. Furthermore, because the
data required to be made  
available by an API as proposed in section III.C. of this proposed rule
includes information  
beyond the USCDI Version 1 data set (proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at
45 CFR  

-----

<span id="54"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**54**  
170.213), certification to the ONC certification criteria at 45 CFR
170.215 would not alone be  
sufficient to ensure the API’s capacity to support the full range of
data elements required under  
the proposal in section III.C. of this proposed rule.  
Finally, we are aware that the implementation specifications currently
proposed by ONC  
for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (published elsewhere in this
**Federal Register**), in  
complement to the base FHIR foundational standards, leave substantial
work to be done by  
health IT developers and their customers to build and deploy technology
to support the proposals  
described in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule. Supplemental
technical resources to support  
efficient and successful implementation of the foundational FHIR
standard can be developed by  
a variety of organizations. However, we recognize that there may be
fewer applicable resources  
to support the development required under this rule. Thus, HHS expects
to provide organizations  
subject to the policies proposed in this proposed rule with technical
assistance and subregulatory  
guidance that incorporates feedback from industry. We recommend readers
review ONC’s 21st  
Century Cures Act proposed rule to fully understand the scope and detail
of the API standard and  
content and vocabulary standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption which
apply to the  
proposals included in this proposed rule. We further recommend readers
review the publicly  
available resources available on the HL7 FHIR
standard  
[(https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html)
and the USCDI Version 1 standard  
(https://www.healthit.gov/USCDI) respectively. These publicly available
materials will inform  
readers understanding of the requirements under this proposed rule and,
we expect, will also  
assist stakeholders in drafting comments submitted within this
rulemaking proceeding.  
As noted in our proposal in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule, we
have determined to  
align our proposal to the types of data, technology use, and available
standards that are consistent  
with an overall HHS approach to support interoperability while
mitigating provider and  

-----

<span id="55"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**55**  
developer burden. We hope to see continued innovation and advancement in
standards  
development for identified gaps in health information data classes and
data elements, as well as  
improved bi-directional patient engagement functionalities. For example,
we are not proposing to  
require that organizations subject to the requirements proposed in
section III.C. of this proposed  
rule offer patients or providers the ability through the API to write
information directly to patient  
records held by the organization. However, we hope that organizations
and their health IT  
developers build on the API technology we do propose to require and
accelerate innovation  
responsive to providers’ and patients’ calls for API write functionality
at the fastest pace  
practicable given the maturity of needed standards. We believe this
innovation may be fostered  
by the concrete steps forward in data exchange and API capabilities we
are proposing to require  
across the significant segment of payers subject to this proposed
rule.  
D. Updates to Standards  
In addition to our efforts to align standards across HHS, we recognize
that while we must  
codify in regulation a specific version of each standard, the need for
continually evolving  
standards development has historically outpaced our ability to amend
regulatory text. In order to  
address how standards development can outpace our rulemaking schedule,
we propose in section  
III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule that regulated entities may use updated
versions of required  
standards if use of the updated version is required by other applicable
law.  
In addition, under certain circumstances, we propose to allow use of an
updated version  
of a standard if the standard is not prohibited under other applicable
law. Where a single standard  
is updated more than once in a brief period of time and upon review of
the standard HHS  
determines that – to reduce fragmentation and preserve efficacy – only
the latest of the updated  
versions should be used We will publish subregulatory guidance to that
effect.

<span id="56"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**56**  
For content and vocabulary standards at 45 CFR part 162 or 42 CFR
423.160, we propose  
to allow the use of an updated version of the content or vocabulary
standard adopted under this  
rulemaking, unless the use of the updated version of the standard is
prohibited for entities  
regulated by that part or the program under that section, or prohibited
by the Secretary for  
purposes of these policies or for use in ONC’s Health IT Certification
Program, or is precluded  
by other applicable law.  
For the content and vocabulary standards proposed by ONC for HHS
adoption at 45 CFR  
170.213 (USCDI Version 1),[25](CMSs.html#56)as well as for API
interoperability standards proposed by ONC  
for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (including HL7 FHIR and other
standards discussed  
above),[26](CMSs.html#56) we propose to allow the use of an updated
version of a standard adopted under this  
rulemaking, provided such updated version has been approved by the
National Coordinator  
through the standards version advancement process described in ONC’s
21st Century Cures Act  
proposed rule (published elsewhere in the **Federal Register**).  
As described in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule, under the
proposed ONC  
Standards Version Advancement Process, ONC would allow health IT
developers participating  
in the ONC Health IT certification program to voluntarily use updated
versions of adopted  
standards in their certified Health IT Modules, so long as certain
conditions are met. The  
proposed Standards Version Advancement Process flexibility gives health
IT developers the  
option to avoid unnecessary costs and is expected to help reduce market
confusion by enabling  
certified Health IT Modules to keep pace with standards advancement and
market needs. Once a  
standard has been adopted for use in ONC’s Health IT Certification
Program through notice and  
comment rulemaking, ONC would undertake an annual, open and transparent
process, including

**57**  
opportunity for public comment, to timely ascertain whether a more
recent version of that  
standard or implementation specification should be approved for
developers’ voluntary use.  
ONC expects to use an expanded section of the Interoperability Standards
Advisory (ISA) web  
platform to facilitate the public transparency and engagement process,
and to publish each year’s  
final list of National Coordinator-approved advanced versions that
health IT developers could  
elect to use consistent with the Standards Version Advancement Process.
(For more detail, please  
see section VIII.B.5. of ONC’s 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule
(published elsewhere in  
this **Federal Register**).) We believe that permitting the use of
updates to standards at 45 CFR  
170.213 and 170.215 consistent with the ONC Standards Version
Advancement Process will  
enhance alignment and foster improved interoperability across the health
system.  
In providing flexibility to the plans and payers that will be required
to implement APIs  
that use the content and vocabulary standards identified in the
regulation text, we also believe it  
is important to maintain compatibility and avoid a disruption or
reduction in data availability to  
the end user. Entities subject to the proposed regulations seeking to
use an updated version of a  
standard must consider factors such as the impact of differences between
standards versions and  
the potential burden on developers and end users to support
transitioning between versions. We  
expect that these practical considerations to maintain compatibility and
avoid disruption will  
discourage premature use of new versions of a standard.  
Therefore, we propose in section III.C.2.b. of this proposed rule that
an entity may use an  
updated version of a required standard so long as use of the updated
version does not disrupt an  
end user’s ability to access the data available through the API proposed
in section III. of this  
proposed rule. Entities that would be required to implement an open API
under this rulemaking  
would be free to upgrade to newer versions of the required standards,
subject only to those  
limiting conditions noted here, at any pace they wish. However, they
must continue to support

**58**  
connectivity, and make the same data available, for end users using
applications that have been  
built to support only the adopted version(s) of the API standards.  
  
We welcome public comment on this proposed approach to allow voluntary
use of  
updated versions of the standards ultimately adopted through this
rulemaking.  
**III. Patient Access Through APIs**  
A. Background on Medicare Blue Button  
We are committed to advancing interoperability, putting patients at the
center of their  
health care, and ensuring they have simple and easy access, without
special effort, to their health  
information. With the establishment of the initial Medicare Blue Button®
service in 2010,  
Medicare beneficiaries became able to download their Part A, Part B, and
Part D health care  
claims data through MyMedicare.gov in either PDF or text format. While
the original Blue  
Button effort was a first step towards liberating patient health
information, we recognize that  
significant opportunities remain to modernize access to that health
information and the ability to  
share health information across the health ecosystem. We believe that
moving to a system in  
which patients have access to and use of their health information will
empower them to make  
better informed decisions about their health care. Additionally,
interoperability, and the ability  
for health information systems and software applications to communicate,
exchange, and  
interpret health information in a usable and readable format, is vital
to improving health care.  
Allowing access to health information only through PDF and text format
limits the utility and  
sharing of the health information.  
Medicare Blue Button 2.0 is a new, modernized version of the original
Blue Button  
service. It enables beneficiaries to access their Medicare Parts A, B,
and D claims data and share  
that electronic health information through an Application Program
Interface (API) with  
applications, services, and research programs they select. As discussed
in more detail in section  

-----

<span id="59"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**59**  
II.A. of this proposed rule, API technology allows software from
different developers to connect  
with one another and exchange electronic health information in
electronic formats that can be  
more easily compiled and leveraged by patients and their caregivers.
Beneficiaries may also  
select third-party applications to compile and leverage their electronic
health information to help  
them manage their health and engage in a more fully informed way in
their health care.  
Medicare Blue Button 2.0 is expected to foster increased competition
among technology  
innovators who serve Medicare patients and their caregivers, such as
through finding better ways  
to use claims data to address their health needs. Patients should have
the ability to access their  
health information, in a format of their choosing, to receive a full
picture of their health records.  
API technology can be an effective way to share data because health
information from various  
sources can be retrieved through these secure interfaces and
consolidated by a single tool, such  
as a third-party application chosen by, in the case of Medicare, the
beneficiary or their caregiver.  
The Medicare Blue Button 2.0 API is also expected to improve the
Medicare beneficiary  
experience by providing beneficiaries secure access to their claims data
in a standardized,  
computable format. We recognize that data security is of the utmost
importance and are  
dedicated to safeguarding patient health information so that only the
beneficiary and their  
authorized personal representative would have the ability to authorize
release of their health  
information through Medicare Blue Button 2.0 to a third-party software
application.  
Medicare Blue Button 2.0 will provide beneficiaries with a longitudinal
view of their  
Medicare claims data, which can then be combined with other health
information within third  
party applications. One benefit of making records available via an API
is that it enables a  
beneficiary to pull Medicare health information along with other heath
information into a single  
application not dictated by any specific health plan, provider, or
portal. APIs allow health  
information to move through the health ecosystem with the patient and
ensure comprehensive

<span id="60"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

****  
****  
**60**  
and timely information is accessible even if the patient changes health
plans, providers, or both  
over time, facilitating continuity of care.  
B. Expanding the Availability of Health Information  
1\. Benefits of Information Access  
We believe there are numerous benefits associated with individuals
having simple and  
easy access to their health care data under a standard that is widely
used. Claims and encounter  
data, used in conjunction with EHR data, can offer a broader and more
holistic understanding of  
an individual’s interactions with the health care system than EHR data
alone. For example,  
inconsistent benefit utilization patterns in an individual’s claims
data, such as a failure to fill a  
prescription or receive recommended therapies, can indicate that the
individual has had difficulty  
adhering to a treatment regimen and may require less expensive
prescription drugs or therapies,  
additional explanation about the severity of their condition, or other
types of assistance.  
Identifying and finding opportunities to address the individual’s
non-adherence to a care plan are  
critical to keeping people with chronic conditions healthy and engaged
so they can avoid  
hospitalizations. While a health plan can use claims and encounter data
to help it identify which  
enrollees could benefit from an assessment of why they are not filling
their prescriptions or who  
might be at risk for particular problems, putting this information into
the hands of the  
individual’s chosen care provider – such as the doctor or nurse
practitioner prescribing the  
medications or the pharmacist who fills the prescriptions – helps them
to engage the patient in  
shared decision making that can help address some of the reasons the
individual might not be  
willing or able to take medications as prescribed. By authorizing their
providers to access the  
same information through the open API, individuals can further
facilitate communication with  
their care teams. Enabling the provider to integrate claims and
encounter information with EHR  
data gives the provider the ability to use the combined information,
with relevant clinical  

-----

<span id="61"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**61**  
decision support tools, as part of normal care delivery in a less
burdensome way, leading to  
improved care. This may be particularly important during times of system
surge, for example, in  
the event of an event that generates a large and sudden demand for
health services, when access  
to such information may help to inform patient triage, transfer, and
care decisions.  
Further, consumers who have immediate electronic access to their health
information are  
empowered to make more informed decisions when discussing their health
needs with providers,  
or when considering changing to a different health plan. In many cases,
claims and encounter  
data can provide a more holistic and comprehensive view of a patient’s
care history than EHR  
data alone. Whereas EHR data is frequently locked in closed, disparate
health systems, care and  
treatment information in the form of claims and encounter data is
comprehensively combined in  
a patient’s claims and billing history. Currently, not all beneficiaries
enrolled in MA plans have  
immediate electronic access to their claims and encounter data and those
who do have it, cannot  
easily share it with providers or others. The same is true of Medicaid
beneficiaries and CHIP  
enrollees, whether enrolled in FFS or managed care programs, and
enrollees in QHPs in FFEs.  
As industries outside of health care continue to integrate multiple
sources of data to understand  
and predict their consumers’ needs, we believe it is important to
position MA organizations,  
Medicaid and CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs to do
the same to encourage  
competition, innovation, and value. Further, we believe that
beneficiaries in Medicaid FFS  
programs administered by state Medicaid agencies and CHIP enrollees in
both FFS and managed  
care should benefit from similar advances and the benefits of innovation
and value.  
CMS has programmatic authority over MA organizations, Medicaid programs
(both FFS  
and managed care), CHIP (including FFS and managed care), and QHP
issuers in FFEs. This  
proposed rule seeks to leverage that CMS authority to make claims and
encounter data available  
to patients in these programs along with other plan data (such as
provider directory data) as

**62**  
detailed in sections III.C. and IV. of this proposed rule. We propose
that regulated entities make  
this data available in a standardized format and through a specific
technological means so that  
third parties can develop and make available applications that make the
data available for patient  
use in a convenient and timely manner. Our proposal would require use of
specific  
interoperability standards adopted by the Secretary in implementing and
complying with the  
proposed requirement to use an API to make this data available. We are
proposing to require, by  
cross-reference to 45 CFR 170.215, the same API technical standards that
ONC is proposing for  
HHS adoption in its 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule (published
elsewhere in this **Federal**  
**Register**). We are also proposing to require that the data elements
made available through the  
proposed API technology must be formatted and presented in accordance
with applicable content  
and vocabulary standards as described in section II. of this proposed
rule. This means that the  
software receiving and using the data can readily consume the data to
support consumer-friendly  
display and other functionalities.  
Ultimately, the goal of this proposal is to require that patient data be
made available in a  
standardized format through an API, so that third parties can develop
and offer applications that  
make the data available in a convenient and timely manner for enrollees
and beneficiaries in MA  
plans, Medicaid and CHIP FFS and managed care delivery systems, and FFEs
that are specified  
in our proposal as detailed below.  
2\. Alignment with the HIPAA Right of Access  
The HIPAA Privacy Rule, at 45 CFR 164.524, provides that individuals
have a right of  
access to inspect and obtain a copy of PHI, defined at 45 CFR 160.103,
about them that is  
maintained by a health plan or covered health care provider in a
designated record set, defined at  
45 CFR 164.501. The right of access also provides individuals with the
right to initiate  
disclosures to third parties.  

-----

<span id="63"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**63**  
Software applications using the API proposed in 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60,
438.242(b)(6),  
457.730, 457.1233(d)(2), and 45 CFR 156.221 would provide an additional
mechanism through  
which the individuals in that coverage who so choose can exercise the
HIPAA right of access to  
their PHI, by giving them a simple and easy electronic way to request,
receive, and share data  
that they want and need, including with a designated third party.
However, as discussed in  
section II of this proposed rule, due to limitations in current
availability of interoperability  
standards for some types of data and patient’s rights to be granted
access in the form and manner  
of their own choosing, the API requirement may not be sufficient to
support access to all of the  
health information subject to the HIPAA right of access because it may
not all be transferable  
through the API.  
C. Open API Proposal for MA, Medicaid, CHIP, and QHP issuers in FFEs  
1\. Introduction  
We are proposing to add new provisions at 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60,
438.242(b)(6),  
457.730, 457.1233(d) and 45 CFR 156.221, that would, respectively,
require MA organizations,  
state Medicaid FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP FFS
programs, CHIP  
managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs (excluding issuers of
SADPs) to implement,  
test, and monitor an openly-published API that is accessible to
third-party applications and  
developers. We note that states with CHIPs are not required to operate
FFS systems and that  
some states’ CHIPs are exclusively operated by managed care entities. We
do not intend to  
require CHIPs that do not operate a FFS program to establish an API;
rather, these states may  
rely on their contracted plans, referred to throughout this proposed
rule as CHIP managed care  
entities, to set up such a system.  
The API would allow enrollees and beneficiaries of MA organizations,
Medicaid and  
CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care
entities, and QHP

**64**  
issuers in FFEs to exercise electronically their HIPAA right of access
to certain health  
information specific to their plan, through the use of common
technologies and without special  
effort. Common technologies, for purposes of our proposal, are those
that are widely used and  
readily available, such as computers, smartphones or tablets.  
We are proposing that the API would be required to meet certain
interoperability  
standards, consistent with the API technical standards proposed by ONC
for HHS adoption in its  
proposed rule (published elsewhere in this **Federal Register**), as
well as to require the use of  
content and vocabulary standards adopted by HHS and that the use of
these standards would be  
applicable across the specific entities subject to proposed 42 CFR
422.119, 431.60,  
438.242(b)(6), 457.730, and 457.1233(d), and 45 CFR 156.221. In this
context, these standards  
are critical to ensure that enrollees of those plans and programs have
electronic access to their  
health information in interoperable form and that access to their health
information and  
information about their coverage are not obstructed by, or confined to,
certain propriety systems.  
Under our proposal, the scope and volume of the information to be
provided or made  
accessible through the open API would include: adjudicated claims
(including cost); encounters  
with capitated providers; provider remittances; enrollee cost-sharing;
and clinical data, including  
laboratory results (where available). We propose that these programs and
organizations, with the  
exception of the QHP issuers in FFEs, would also be required to make
information regarding  
provider directories and formularies available through the open API.
Sections 1852(c),  
1932(a)(5), and 2103(f)(3) of the Act require that MA organizations and
Medicaid MCOs, and  
CHIP managed care entities provide basic information to their enrollees
on how to get covered  
benefits in the plan and to facilitate decision making about plan
choice, providers, and benefits.  
These statutory provisions indicate information enrollees could use to
make decisions about their  
health care. The API proposals at 42 CFR 422.119(a), 438.242(b)(6), and
457.1233(d) support

and complement existing implementation of these provisions in a robust
and modern way. We  
believe the health information that would be available through the
proposed API would greatly  
supplement the benefit, provider directory, and, if applicable,
formulary information from states  
and managed care plans by providing important details and context, thus
enabling enrollees to  
make more informed, proactive decisions.  
Additionally, we believe that since most of the information required to
be provided by  
these statutory sections of the Act, such as the provider directory, is
currently accessible to  
enrollees and potential enrollees electronically online, making such
standardized health  
information available through the proposed API could allow easy
integration for use by more  
enrollees. Further, the proposal would enable these enrollees to more
easily share their  
information with providers, family, caregivers, and others. As a general
matter, providing  
important details and context to patients gives them more visibility
into their treatment record  
through adjudicated claims, allowing them to be true partners in their
health care. This goal is  
related to the disclosure requirements in sections 1852, 1932 and 2103
of the Act and our  
proposal furthers each.  
We also believe the proposed API allows for the administration of more
efficient and  
effective Medicaid and CHIP programs by taking advantage of commonly
used methods of  
information sharing and data standardization. Consumers routinely
perform many daily tasks on  
their mobile phones – banking, shopping, paying bills, scheduling –
using secure applications.  
We believe that obtaining their health information should be just as
easy, convenient, and user-  
friendly. Our proposal is a step toward that vision for enrollees in MA
plans, Medicaid FFS and  
managed care programs, CHIP FFS programs and managed care entities, and
QHPs in FFEs.  
Finally, our proposal includes a number of parameters and standards for
the API and for

adopting, implementing, testing, and monitoring the API; the specific
pieces of our proposal are  
addressed in turn in sections III.C.2 of this proposed rule.  
2\. The Open API Proposal  
This section outlines the components of the open API proposal.
Specifically, this section  
will discuss:  
● Authority to require implementation of an open API;  
● The API technical standard and content and vocabulary standards;  
● Data Required to be Available Through the Open API & Timeframes for
Data  
Availability;  
● Documentation Requirements for APIs;  
● Routine Testing and Monitoring of Open APIs;  
● Compliance with Existing Privacy and Security Requirements;  
● Denial or Discontinuation of Access to the API;  
● Enrollee and Beneficiary Resources Regarding Privacy and Security;  
● Exceptions or Provisions Specific to Certain Programs or
Sub-Programs;  
● Applicability and Timing; and  
● Request for Information on Information Sharing Between Payers and
Providers  
Through APIs.  
We are proposing nearly identical language for the regulations requiring
open APIs at 42  
CFR 422.119; 431.60, and 457.730 and 45 CFR 156.221 for MA
organizations, Medicaid state  
agencies, state CHIP agencies, and QHPs in FFEs; Medicaid managed care
plans would be  
required at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6), to comply with the requirement at 42
CFR 431.60, and CHIP  
managed care entities would be required by 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) to
comply with the  
requirement at 42 CFR 457.730. As discussed in detail in this proposed
rule, we are proposing  

-----

<span id="67"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**67**  
similar if not identical requirements for these various entities to
establish and maintain an open  
API, make specified data available through that API, disclose API
documentation, provide  
access to the API, and make resources available to enrollees. We believe
that such nearly  
identical text is appropriate here as the reasons and need for the
proposal and the associated  
requirements are the same across these programs. Except as noted below
with regard to specific  
proposals, we intend to interpret and apply the regulations proposed in
this section, III.C. of this  
proposed rule, similarly and starting with similar text is an important
step to communicate that to  
the applicable entities that would be required to comply.  
In paragraph (a) of each of the proposed regulations, we propose that
the regulated entity  
(that is, the MA organization, the State Medicaid or CHIP agency, the
Medicaid managed care  
plan, the CHIP managed care entity or the QHP in an FFE, as applicable)
would be required to  
implement and maintain an open API that permits third-party applications
to retrieve, with the  
approval and at the direction of the individual beneficiary, data
specified in paragraph (b) of each  
regulation through the use of common technologies and without special
effort from the  
beneficiary. By “common technologies and without special effort” by the
enrollee, we mean use  
of common consumer technologies, like smart phones, home computers,
laptops or tablets, to  
request, receive, use and approve transfer of the data that would be
available through the open  
API technology. By “without special effort,” we codify our expectation
that third-party software,  
as well as proprietary applications and web portals operated by the
payer could be used to  
connect to the API and provide access to the data to the enrollee. In
our proposed regulations, we  
address the data that must be made available through the API in
paragraph (b); the technical  
standards for the API and the data it contains in paragraph (c); the
documentation requirements  
for the API in paragraph (d); explicit authority for the payer regulated
under each regulation to  
deny or discontinue access to the API in paragraph (e); and requirements
for posting information  

-----

<span id="68"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**68**  
about resources on security and privacy for beneficiaries in paragraphs
(f) or (g). Additional  
requirements specific to each program, discussed in sections IV. and V
of this proposed rule, are  
also included in some of the regulations that address the API.  
We solicit comment on our use of virtually identical language in these
regulations and  
our overall proposal to require implementation and maintenance of an
open API.  
a. Authority to Require Implementation of an open API  
Our proposal would apply to MA organizations, Medicaid state agencies
and managed  
care plans, state CHIP agencies and managed care entities, and QHP
issuers in FFEs. We note  
that our proposal for Medicaid managed care plans, at 42 CFR
438.242(b)(6), would require  
MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs to comply with the regulation that we are
proposing for Medicaid  
state agencies at 42 CFR 431.60 as if that regulation applied to the
Medicaid managed care plan.  
Similarly, we intend for CHIP managed care entities to comply with the
requirements we  
propose at 42 CFR 457.730 via the regulations proposed at 42 CFR
457.1233(d)(2). We propose  
to structure the regulations this way to avoid ambiguity and to ensure
that this API proposal  
would result in consistent access to information for Medicaid
beneficiaries and CHIP enrollees,  
regardless of whether they are in a FFS delivery system administered by
the state or in a  
managed care delivery system. CHIP currently adopts the Medicaid
requirements at 42 CFR  
438.242 in whole. We propose revisions to 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(1) to
indicate CHIP’s continued  
adoption of 42 CFR 438.242(a), (b)(1) through (5), (c), (d), and (e),
while proposing specific text  
for CHIP managed care entities to comply with the regulations proposed
at 42 CFR  
457.1233(d)(2) in lieu of the proposed Medicaid revision, which would
add 42 CFR  
438.242(b)(6). In our discussion of the specifics of this proposal and
how we propose to codify it  
at 42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, 457.730, and 45 CFR 156.221, we refer only
generally to 42 CFR  
438.242(b)(6) and 457.1233(d)(2) for this reason.

(1) Medicare Advantage  
Sections 1856(b) and 1857(e) of the Act provide CMS with the authority
to add standards  
and requirements for MA organizations that the Secretary finds necessary
and appropriate and  
not inconsistent with Part C of the Medicare statute; section 1852(c) of
the Act requires  
disclosure by MA organizations of specific information about the plan,
covered benefits, and the  
network of providers; section 1852(h) of the Act requires MA
organizations to provide their  
enrollees with timely access to medical records and health information
insofar as MA  
organizations maintain such information. As technology evolves to allow
for faster, more  
efficient methods of information transfer, so do expectations as to what
is generally considered  
“timely.” Currently, consumers across public and private sectors have
become increasingly  
accustomed to accessing a broad range of personal records, such as bank
statements, credit  
scores, and voter registrations, immediately through electronic means
and with updates received  
in near real time. Thus, we believe that in order to align our standards
with 21st century demands,  
we must take steps for MA enrollees to have immediate, electronic access
to their health  
information and plan information. The proposed requirements in this rule
are intended to achieve  
this goal.  
We believe that the scope of the information that would be made
available through an  
API under this proposal (described in section III. of this proposed
rule) is consistent with the  
access and disclosure requirements in section 1852 of the Act, and we
rely on our authority in  
sections 1856(b) and 1857(e) of the Act, which provide CMS with the
authority to add standards  
and requirements for MA organizations, to require MA organizations to
make specific types of  
information, at minimum, accessible through an open API and require
timeframes for update  
cycles. Throughout this section III.C. of this proposed rule, we explain
how and why the open  
API proposal is necessary and appropriate for MA organizations and the
MA program; the goals  

-----

<span id="70"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**70**  
and purposes of achieving interoperability for the health care system as
a whole are equally  
applicable to MA organizations and their enrollees; thus, the discussion
in section II of this  
proposed rule serves to provide further explanation as to how an open
API proposal is necessary  
and appropriate in the MA program. Further, having easy access to their
claims, encounter, and  
other health information would also facilitate beneficiaries’ ability to
detect and report fraud,  
waste, and abuse – a critical component of an effective program.  
To the extent necessary, we also rely on section 1860D-12(b)(3) of the
Act to add  
provisions specific to the Part D benefit offered by certain MA
organizations. For MA  
organizations that offer MA Prescription Drug plans, we are proposing
requirements in 42 CFR  
422.119(b)(2) regarding electronic health information for Part D
coverage. That aspect of our  
proposal is also supported by the disclosure requirements imposed under
section 1860D-4(a) of  
the Act, which requires Part D claims information, pharmacy directory
information, and  
formulary information to be disclosed to enrollees.  
(2) Medicaid and CHIP  
We are proposing new provisions at 42 CFR 431.60(a), 457.730,
438.242(b)(6), and  
457.1233(d)(2) that would require states administering Medicaid FFS or
CHIP FFS, Medicaid  
managed care plans, and CHIP managed care entities to implement an open
API that permits  
third-party applications authorized by the beneficiary or enrollee to
retrieve certain standardized  
data. This proposed requirement would provide Medicaid beneficiaries’
and CHIP enrollees  
simple and easy access to their information through common technologies,
such as smartphones,  
tablets, or laptop computers, and without special effort on the part of
the user.  
For Medicaid, we are proposing these new requirements under the
authority in section  
1902(a)(4) of the Act, which requires that a state Medicaid plan for
medical assistance provide  
such methods of administration as are found by the Secretary to be
necessary for the proper and  

-----

<span id="71"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**71**  
efficient operation of the plan and section 1902(a)(19) of the Act,
which requires that care and  
services be provided in a manner consistent with simplicity of
administration and the best  
interests of the recipients. For CHIP, we propose these requirements
under the authority in  
section 2101(a) of the Act, which sets forth that the purpose of title
XXI is to provide funds to  
states to provide child health assistance to uninsured, low-income
children in an effective and  
efficient manner that is coordinated with other sources of health
benefits coverage. Together  
these provide us with authority (in conjunction with our delegation of
authority from the  
Secretary) to adopt requirements for Medicaid and CHIP that are
necessary to ensure the  
provision of quality care in an efficient and cost-effective way,
consistent with simplicity of  
administration and the best interest of the beneficiary.  
We believe that requiring state Medicaid and CHIP agencies and managed
care  
plans/entities to take steps to make Medicaid beneficiaries’ and CHIP
enrollees’ claims,  
encounters, and other health information available through interoperable
technology will  
ultimately lead to these enrollees accessing that information in a
convenient, timely, and portable  
way, which is essential for these programs to be effectively and
efficiently administered in the  
best interests of beneficiaries. Further, as noted in this proposed
rule, there are independent  
statutory provisions that require the disclosure and delivery of
information to Medicaid  
beneficiaries and CHIP enrollees; this proposal assists in the
implementation of those  
requirements in a way that is appropriate and necessary in the 21st
century. We believe making  
this information available in this format would result in better health
outcomes and patient  
satisfaction and improve the cost effectiveness of the entire health
care system, including  
Medicaid and CHIP. Having easy access to their claims, encounter, and
other health information  
would also facilitate beneficiaries’ ability to detect and report fraud,
waste, and abuse – a critical  
component of an effective program.  

-----

<span id="72"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**72**  
As technology has advanced, we have encouraged states, health plans, and
providers to  
adopt various forms of technology to improve the accurate and timely
exchange of standardized  
health care information. This proposal would move Medicaid and CHIP
programs in the  
direction of enabling better information access by Medicaid
beneficiaries and CHIP enrollees,  
which would make them active partners in their health care through the
exchange of electronic  
health information by easily monitoring and sharing their data. By
requiring that certain  
information be available in and through standardized formats and
technologies, our proposal  
moves these programs toward interoperability, which is key for data
sharing and access, and  
ultimately, improved health outcomes. As an additional note, states will
be expected to  
implement the CHIP provisions using CHIP administrative funding, which
is limited under  
section 2105(a)(1)(D)(v) and 2105(c)(2)(A) of the Act to 10 percent of a
State’s total annual  
CHIP expenditures.  
(3) Qualified Health Plan Issuers in Federally-facilitated Exchanges  
We propose a new QHP minimum certification standard at 45 CFR 156.221(a)
that would  
require QHP issuers in FFEs, not including SADPs, to implement an open
API that permits third-  
party applications, with the approval and at the direction of the
individual enrollee, to retrieve  
standardized data concerning adjudicated claims (including cost),
encounters with capitated  
providers, and provider remittances, enrollee cost-sharing, and clinical
data, including laboratory  
results (where available). We are also proposing to require that the
data be made available to  
QHP enrollees through common technologies, such as smartphones or
tablets, and without  
special effort from enrollees.  
We are proposing these new requirements under our authority in section
1311(e)(1)(B) of  
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health
Care and Education  
Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-148, enacted March 23, 2010, and
Pub. L. 111-152,  

-----

<span id="73"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**73**  
enacted March 30, 2010, respectively) (collectively referred to as the
Affordable Care Act),  
which affords the Exchanges the discretion to certify QHPs that are in
the best interests of  
qualified individuals and qualified employers. Specifically, section
1311(e) of the Affordable  
Care Act authorizes Exchanges to certify QHPs that meet the QHP
certification standards  
established by the Secretary, and if the Exchange determines that making
available such health  
plan through such Exchange is in the interests of qualified individuals
and qualified employers in  
the state or states in which such Exchange operates.  
We believe there are numerous benefits associated with individuals
having access to their  
health plan data that is built upon widely used standards. The ability
to easily obtain, use, and  
share claims, encounter, and other health data enables enrollees to more
effectively and easily  
use the health care system. For example, by being able to easily access
a comprehensive list of  
their adjudicated claims, the plan enrollee can ensure their providers
know what services have  
already been received, avoid receiving duplicate services; and verify
when prescriptions were  
filled. We believe these types of activities would result in better
health outcomes and enrollee  
satisfaction and improve the cost effectiveness of the entire health
care system. Having simple  
and easy access, without special effort, to their health information,
including cost and payment  
information, also facilitates enrollees’ ability to detect and report
fraud, waste, and abuse – a  
critical component of an effective program. Existing and emerging
technologies provide a path to  
make information and resources for health and health care management
universal, integrated,  
equitable, accessible to all, and personally relevant. Therefore, we
believe generally certifying  
only health plans that make enrollees’ health information available to
them in a convenient,  
timely, and portable way is in the interests of qualified individuals
and qualified employers in the  
state or states in which an FFE operates. We encourage SBEs to consider
whether a similar  
requirement should be applicable to QHP issuers participating in their
Exchange.

b. API Technical Standard and Content and Vocabulary Standards  
We propose to require at 42 CFR 422.119(a) and (c), 431.60(a) and (c)
and 457.730(a)  
and (c), 438.242(b)(6) and 457.1233(d)(2), and 45 CFR 156.221(a) and
(c), that MA  
organizations, Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care
plans, CHIP managed  
care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs implement open API technology
conformant with the API  
technical standards proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215
(published  
elsewhere in this **Federal Register**) (see also section II.A.3. of
this proposed rule). We further  
propose to require the use of the following content and vocabulary
standards for data available  
through the API, where applicable to the data type or data element,
unless an alternate standard is  
required by other applicable law: standards adopted at 45 CFR part 162
and 42 CFR 423.160;  
and standards proposed by ONC for adoption by HHS at 45 CFR 170.213
(USCDI Version 1).  
See section II.A.3. of this proposed rule for further information about
our proposals regarding  
how entities subject to this rule would be required to utilize these
standards. We are proposing  
that both the API technical standard and the content and vocabulary
standards would be required  
across the MA program, Medicaid program, and CHIP, and by QHP issuers in
FFEs (not  
including issuers of SADPs).  
Further, with the new proposed requirements to implement and maintain an
API at 42  
CFR 422.119(a), 431.60(a), and 457.730(a), we are proposing
corresponding requirements at  
proposed 42 CFR 422.119(c) for MA plans, 431.60(c) for Medicaid FFS
programs, and  
457.730(c) for CHIP FFS programs implementing the proposed API
technology. In proposed  
paragraphs 42 CFR 422.119(c), 431.60(c), 457.730(c), MA plans and the
state Medicaid or CHIP  
(for CHIP agencies that operate FFS systems) agency would be required to
implement API  
technology conformant with the standards proposed by ONC for HHS
adoption at 45 CFR  
170.215; for data available through the API, to use content and
vocabulary standards adopted at  

-----

<span id="75"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**75**  
45 CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.160, and proposed for adoption at 45 CFR
170.213; and to  
maintain and use the technology in compliance with applicable law,
including but not limited to  
45 CFR parts 162, 42 CFR part 2, and the HIPAA Privacy and Security
Rules.  
We similarly propose at 45 CFR 156.221(c) that QHP issuers in FFEs must
implement  
API technology conformant with the API technical standards proposed by
ONC for HHS  
adoption at 45 CFR 170.215; for data available through the API, use
content and vocabulary  
standards adopted at 45 CFR part 162 and 42 CFR 423.160, and proposed
for adoption at 45  
CFR 170.213; and maintain and use the technology in compliance with
applicable law, including  
but not limited to 45 CFR part 162, 42 CFR part 2, and the HIPAA Privacy
and Security Rules.  
We believe that these proposals would serve to create a health care
information  
ecosystem that allows and encourages the health care market to tailor
products and services to  
better serve and compete for patients, thereby increasing quality,
decreasing costs, and  
empowering patients with information that helps them live better,
healthier lives. Additionally,  
under these proposals, clinicians would be able to review information on
their patient’s current  
prescriptions and services received by the enrollee on the enrollee’s
smartphone. Also, the  
enrollee could allow clinicians to access such information by sharing
data received through the  
API with the clinician’s EHR system—by forwarding the information once
the enrollee receives  
it or by authorizing release of the data through the API directly to the
clinician’s EHR system.  
We also encourage payers to consider using the proposed API
infrastructure as a means  
to exchange PHI for other health care purposes, such as to health care
providers for treatment  
purposes. Sharing interoperable information directly with the enrollee’s
health care provider’s  
EHR in advance of a patient visit would save time during appointments
and ultimately improve  
the quality of care delivered to patients. Most clinicians and patients
have access to the internet,  
providing many access points for viewing health information over secure
connections. We  

-----

<span id="76"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**76**  
believe that these proposed requirements would significantly improve
patients’ experiences by  
providing a mechanism through which they can access their data in a
standardized, computable,  
and digital format in alignment with other public and private health
care entities. We also believe  
that these proposals are designed to empower patients to have simple and
easy access to their  
data in a usable digital format, and therefore, can empower them to
decide how their health  
information is going to be used. However, we remind payers that this
proposed regulation  
regarding the API would not lower or change their obligations as HIPAA
covered entities to  
comply with regulations regarding standard transactions in 45 CFR part
162.  
As discussed in section II.A.3. of this proposed rule, we recognize that
while we must  
codify in regulation a specific version of each standard, the need for
continually evolving  
standards development has historically outpaced our ability to amend
regulations. To address  
how standards development can outpace our rulemaking schedule, we offer
several proposals.  
We propose that regulated entities may use an updated version of a
standard where required by  
other applicable law. We also propose that regulated entities may use an
updated version of the  
standard where not prohibited by other applicable law, under certain
circumstances. First, we  
propose to allow the use of an updated version of content or vocabulary
standards adopted at 45  
CFR part 162 or 42 CFR 423.160, unless the use of the updated version of
the standard is prohibited  
for entities regulated by that part or the program under that section,
is prohibited by the Secretary  
for purposes of these policies, is prohibited for use in ONC’s Health IT
Certification Program, or  
is prohibited by other applicable law.  
Second, for the content and vocabulary standards proposed by ONC for HHS
adoption at  
45 CFR 170.213 (USCDI Version 1), as well as for API interoperability
standards proposed by  
ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (including HL7 FHIR and other
standards discussed  
above), we propose to allow the use of an updated version, provided such
updated version has  

-----

<span id="77"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**77**  
been approved by the National Coordinator through the Standards Version
Advancement Process  
described in ONC’s 21st Century Cures Act proposed rule (published
elsewhere in this **Federal**  
**Register**)).  
Finally, we propose that use of an updated standard by a payer that is
subject to these  
proposed regulations must not disrupt an end user’s ability to access
the data available through  
the API proposed in section III. of this proposed rule using an
application that was designed to  
work with an API that conforms to the API standard proposed under this
rule. Entities that  
would be required to implement an open API under this rulemaking would
be free to upgrade to  
newer versions of the required standards, subject only to those limiting
conditions noted here,  
and at any pace they wish. However, they must continue to support
connectivity and make the  
same data available to applications that have been built to support only
the adopted version(s) of  
the API standards. For further discussion of these proposals, see
section II.A.3.D. of this  
proposed rule.  
c. Data Required to be Available Through the Open API & Timeframes for
Data Availability  
We propose the content that must be accessible for each enrollee of an
entity subject to  
our open API proposal as set out at paragraph (b) of 42 CFR 422.119,
431.60, and 457.730 and  
45 CFR 156.221; as noted previously, the regulations for Medicaid
managed care plans and  
CHIP managed care entities cross-reference and incorporate the
regulations we propose for  
Medicaid and CHIP programs. We note that the types of content proposed
here would represent  
the minimum threshold for compliance; at their discretion, MA
organizations, state Medicaid and  
CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care
entities, and QHP  
issuers in FFEs would have the option to use the API required by this
proposed rule to make  
additional types of health information or plan information available,
exceeding these minimum  
requirements.

We request comment on the data proposed to be made available as detailed
in the  
subsections below, the appropriateness of the proposed timeframes, and
suggestions for  
alternative timeframes that consider the utility to the beneficiary, as
well as challenges that the  
proposed timeframe may create for the entities that would have to
comply.  
(1) Patient Claims and Encounter Data  
We propose that MA organizations, Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs,
Medicaid  
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs,
permit third-party  
applications to retrieve, with the approval of an enrollee, certain
specific data: adjudicated claims  
data, including provider remittances and beneficiary or enrollee
cost-sharing data; encounters  
from capitated providers; and clinical data, including laboratory
results (but only if managed by  
the payer). Adjudicated claims data would include on approved and denied
claims; under this  
proposal, adjudicated claims data includes that for which the plan has
made an initial payment  
decision even when the period during which an enrollee can file an
appeal is still in effect, or  
when the enrollee has filed an appeal and is awaiting a reconsideration
decision. We specifically  
request comments from plans regarding the feasibility of including such
claims data, including  
any possible timing issues. In addition, the open APIs required for
these entities must make  
available formulary information (for MA-PD plans) or information about
covered outpatient  
drugs and preferred drug lists (for state Medicaid and CHIP agencies,
Medicaid managed care  
plans and CHIP managed care entities).  
Our proposal includes timeframe requirements for making these various
categories of  
data available through the open API. For MA organizations, proposed 42
CFR 422.119(b)(1)(i),  
(1)(ii), and (2)(i) would require open API access to all claims activity
pertaining to adjudicated  
claims (including cost) and encounter data for benefits covered by the
plan (that is, Medicare  
Part A and Part B items and services, Part D prescription drugs if
covered by the MA plan, and

**79**  
any supplemental benefits) no later than one (1) business day after a
claim is adjudicated or the  
encounter data is received by the MA organization. For clinical data,
including laboratory results,  
MA organizations that manage such data would be required under 42 CFR
422.119(b)(1)(iv) to  
provide access through the open API to that data no later than one
business day after it is  
received by the MA plan. For Medicaid state agencies and managed care
plans, claims data,  
encounter data, and clinical data, including laboratory results (if
available) would be required  
(specifically at 42 CFR 431.60(b)(1),(2), and (4)) through the API no
later than one business day  
after the claim is processed or the data is received. For State Medicaid
agencies in connection  
with the FFS program, the API would have to include all claims data
concerning adjudicated  
claims and standardized encounter data from providers (other than MCOs,
PIHPs or PAHPs) that  
are paid using capitated payments. The requirement for Medicaid managed
care plans to provide  
encounter data is specified at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6)(i); encounter data
would include any data  
from subcontractors and providers compensated by the managed care plan
on the basis of  
capitation payments, such as behavioral health organizations, dental
management organizations,  
and pharmacy benefit managers. The API of Medicaid managed care plans
would have to  
include all claims and encounter data would be included regardless if it
is adjudicated or  
generated by the managed care plan itself, subcontractor, or provider
compensated on the basis  
of capitation payments. All data would need to be obtained in a timely
manner to comply with  
these proposed requirements.  
For CHIP agencies and managed care entities, claims data, encounter
data, and reports of  
lab test results (if available) would be required (specifically at 42
CFR 457.730(b)(1),(2), and  
(4)) through the API as soon as possible but no later than one business
day. The proposal for  
CHIP state agencies (regarding FFS programs) and CHIP managed care
entities is identical to the  
proposal for Medicaid State agencies (regarding FFS programs) and
Medicaid managed care  

-----

<span id="80"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

****  
**80**  
plans. For QHP issuers in FFEs, our proposed regulation at 45 CFR
156.221(b) would require  
claims, encounter, and lab data to be available within one business day
of adjudication and  
receipt, respectively.  
These proposed timeframes would ensure that data provided through the
API would be  
the most current data available, which may be critical if the data is
provided by an enrollee to his  
or her health care provider to use in making clinical decisions. Under
our proposal, the claims  
and encounter data to be disclosed should include information such as
enrollee identifiers, dates  
of service, payment information (provider remittance if applicable and
available), and enrollee  
cost-sharing. The ability for enrollees – created and facilitated by the
API required under our  
proposal -– to access this information electronically would make it
easier for them to take it with  
them as they move from payer to payer or among providers across the care
continuum.  
Regarding the provision of standardized encounter data through the API
within one (1)  
business day of the receiving the data, we note that this proposal would
mean that a payer must  
rely on capitated providers submitting their encounter data in a timely
manner to ensure that  
patients receive a timely and complete set of data. To the extent
providers do not submit in a  
timely manner, there would be a delay in patients having access to their
data. We recommend  
that MA organizations, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care
entities, and QHP  
issuers in FFEs that would need this information in order to meet the
proposed API requirements  
should consider whether their contracts with network providers should
include timing  
requirements for the submission of encounter data and claims so that the
payer can comply with  
the API requirements. For Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, we encourage
states to consider  
other means to ensure that necessary encounter data from providers is
also provided on a timely  
basis.

<span id="81"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**81**  
We note that the data for claims and remittances that would be available
through the API  
is much of the same data that is required for the ASC X12 837, ASC X12
835, and ASC X12 863  
standards which are required for certain transactions between certain
entities under 45 CFR  
162.1102, 162.1602 and 162.1603, as well as the Part D eRx transaction
standards that use for  
conveying prescription and prescription-related information between Part
D plans, providers, and  
pharmacies as specified in 42 CFR 423.160. As most claims are submitted
to payers  
electronically utilizing these industry standard transaction types, we
believe this maximizes  
efficiency and reduces programming burden. As noted previously, our
proposed regulation for  
Medicaid managed care plans at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) and for CHIP managed
care entities at 42  
CFR 457.1233(d)(2) would require MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs to comply with
the same standard  
transaction types.  
Specifically regarding QHP issuers in FFEs, in 45 CFR 156.221(b)(1)(i)
and (ii), we  
propose to require that QHP issuers participating in an FFE make
available through the API  
standardized data concerning adjudicated claims (including cost) and
encounters with capitated  
providers. Under proposed paragraph (b)(1)(i), QHP issuers in FFEs would
be required to make  
available standardized adjudicated claim, provider remittance, and
enrollee cost-sharing data  
through the API within one (1) business day after the claim is
processed. Under proposed  
paragraph (b)(1)(ii), QHP issuers in FFEs would be required to provide
standardized encounter  
data through the API within one (1) business day of the issuer receiving
the data.  
We are also considering requiring the encounter data to be available
through the API  
within a certain period after the encounter, within one (1) business day
after the encounter data is  
received. We seek comment on what a reasonable period from the encounter
date would be for  
us to consider as part of future rulemaking. In addition, we solicit
comment on our authority to  
require MA organizations, States (for FFS Medicaid programs and CHIP),
Medicaid and CHIP  

-----

<span id="82"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**82**  
managed care plans, and QHPs in the FFEs to require submission of such
data on a particular  
timeframe.  
(2) Provider Directory Data  
We are also proposing at 42 CFR 422.119(b)(1)(iii), 431.60(b)(3),
438.242(b)(6)(ii),  
457.730(b)(3), and 457.1233(d)(2)(ii) that the required API make
available provider directory  
data, including updates to such data. Our proposal at 45 CFR 156.221
would not require QHP  
issuers to permit third-party retrieval of provider directory and
preferred drug list information  
because such information is already required to be provided by QHPs in
FFEs.  
For MA organizations, at proposed 42 CFR 422.119(b)(1)(iii), we propose
to specify that  
MA organizations make specific provider directory information for their
network of contracted  
providers accessible through their APIs: the names of providers;
addresses; phone numbers; and  
specialty. This information is the same information MA organizations are
already required to  
disclose to their enrollees under 42 CFR 422.111(b)(3) and make
available online under 42 CFR  
422.111(h)(2)(ii). MA organizations would be required to ensure the
availability of this  
information through their APIs for all MA plans. Including this
information in an open API  
allows non- MA third-party applications to consume, aggregate, and
display plan data in  
different contexts, allowing patients to understand and compare plan
information in a way that  
can best serve their individual needs. MA plans would be required to
update provider directory  
information available through the API no later than 30 calendar days
after changes to the  
provider directory are made. In addition, we are adding a new MA
contract requirement at 42  
CFR 422.504(a)(18) specifying that MA organizations must comply with the
requirement for  
access to health data and plan information under 42 CFR 422.119.  
Under proposed 42 CFR 431.60(b)(3) and 457.730(b)(3), state Medicaid and
CHIP  
agencies respectively would be required to make provider directory
information available  

-----

<span id="83"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**83**  
through the API, including updated provider information no later than 30
calendar days after the  
state receives updated provider information. As noted previously, our
proposed regulation for  
Medicaid managed care plans at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) and for CHIP managed
care entities at 42  
CFR 457.1233(d)(2) would require MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs to comply with
the same  
standard, with the addition of specific provider directory information
as noted in 42 CFR  
438.242(b)(6)(ii) and 457.1233(d)(2)(ii). For Medicaid managed care
plans and CHIP managed  
care entities, the provider directory information available through the
API must include all  
information that is specified in 42 CFR 438.10(h)(1) for disclosure to
managed care enrollees.  
We note that we have proposed that the API be updated with new provider
directory information  
within 30 calendar days from when the updated information is received by
the State (or the  
managed care plan under 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) and 457.1233(d)(2)) to be
consistent with  
existing Medicaid managed care rules at 42 CFR 438.10(h)(3). We propose
that the API  
implemented by the State Medicaid agency would include the data elements
specified for  
disclosure by Medicaid state agencies in section 1902(a)(83) of the Act;
we propose in 42 CFR  
438.242(b)(6)(ii) that the API implemented by Medicaid managed care
plans would have the  
data elements specified for disclosure at 42 CFR 438.10(h)(1). For CHIP
agencies that operate  
FFS systems and CHIP managed care entities at 42 CFR 457.730(b)(3) and
457.1233(d)(2)(ii),  
respectively, we have also proposed 30 calendar days.  
We are not proposing a similar requirement for QHP issuers in FFEs.
These issuers are  
already required, under 45 CFR 156.230(c) and implementing guidance, to
make provider  
directory information accessible in a machine-readable format. Because
this information is  
already highly accessible in this format, we do not believe the benefits
of making it also  
available through an open API outweigh the burden for QHP issuers in
FFEs. However, we seek  

-----

<span id="84"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**84**  
comment as to whether this same requirement should apply to QHP issuers,
or if such a  
requirement would be overly burdensome for them.  
We request comment on these proposals.  
(3) Clinical Data including Laboratory Results  
Regarding the provision of clinical data, including laboratory results,
we propose at 42  
CFR 422.119(b)(1)(iv) that MA organizations make clinical data, such as
laboratory test results  
available through the API if the MA organization manages such data.
Because we propose in  
paragraph (c) that the USCDI standard, proposed by ONC for HHS adoption
at 45 CFR 170.213,  
be used as the content and vocabulary standard for this clinical data as
provided in the API, we  
intend our proposal to mean that the data required under paragraph
(b)(1)(iv) be the same as the  
data that is specified in that content and vocabulary standard. In
effect, we are proposing any  
clinical data included in the USCDI standard, proposed by ONC for HHS
adoption at 45 CFR  
170.213, be available through the API if such data is managed by the MA
organization. We  
recognize that some MA organizations receive this information regularly
or as a part of their  
contracted arrangements for health services, but that not all MA
organizations do. Therefore, this  
proposed requirement applies to MA organizations, regardless of the type
of MA plan offered by  
the MA organization, but only under circumstances when the MA
organization receives and  
maintains this data as a part of its normal operations. This proposed
requirement aligns with  
existing regulations at 42 CFR 422.118, which require MA organizations
to disclose to  
individual enrollees any medical records or other health or enrollment
information the MA  
organizations maintain with respect to their enrollees. We propose that
this data be available in  
the API no later than 1 business day from its receipt by the MA
organization.  
Similarly, the proposed regulations for Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs
and managed  
care plans (proposed 42 CFR 431.60(b)(4) and 457.730(b)(4)), require
provision of standardized  

-----

<span id="85"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**85**  
data for clinical data, including laboratory results, through the API,
if available, no later than one  
(1) business day after a claim is adjudicated or the data is received
(by the state or the managed  
care plan/entity). This would ensure that data provided through the API
would be the most  
current data available, which may be critical if the data is being
shared by an enrollee with a  
health care provider who is basing clinical decisions on the data. Like
proposed 42 CFR  
422.119(c), these Medicaid and CHIP regulations propose use of the that
the USCDI standard,  
proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.213, as the content and
vocabulary standard  
for the clinical data available through the API; therefore, we are, in
effect, proposing any clinical  
data included in the USCDI standard, proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at
45 CFR 170.213,  
be available through the API. For state agencies managing Medicaid or
CHIP FFS programs,  
such data must be included through the API under our proposal only if
the state manages clinical  
data. Our proposed regulation for Medicaid managed care plans at 42 CFR
438.242(b)(6) and  
CHIP managed care entities at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) would require MCOs,
PIHPs, and PAHPs  
to comply with the same standard in terms of the scope of information
and the timing of its  
availability through the API; the limitation about the availability of
clinical data through the API  
would carry through to managed care plans and entities under our
proposal.  
Proposed 45 CFR 156.221(b)(3) requires QHP issuers in FFEs to also make
available,  
with the approval of the enrollee, clinical data, including laboratory
results, if the QHP maintains  
such data.  
We recognize not all of the entities subject to this requirement have
uniform access to  
this type of data and seek comment on what barriers exist that would
discourage them from  
obtaining, maintaining, and sharing this data. We request comment on
these proposals.  
(4) Drug Benefit Data, including Pharmacy Directory, and Formulary
Data  

-----

<span id="86"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**86**  
We are also proposing that drug benefit data, including pharmacy
directory information  
and formulary or preferred drug list data, also be available through the
API at proposed 42 CFR  
422.119(b)(2)(ii) and (iii), 431.60(b)(5), and 457.730(b)(5). As
previously discussed, Medicaid  
managed care plans would be required by 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) to comply
with the requirement  
at 42 CFR 431.60(b)(5), and CHIP managed care entities would be required
by 42 CFR  
457.1233(d)(2) to comply with the requirement at 42 CFR 457.730(b)(5).  
We propose at 42 CFR 422.119(b)(2)(ii) and (iii) that MA organizations
offering MA-PD  
plans make available pharmacy directory data, including the number, mix,
and addresses of  
pharmacies in the plan network, as well as formulary data including
covered Part D drugs and  
any tiered formulary structure or utilization management procedure which
pertains to those  
drugs. The pharmacy directory information is the same information that
MA-PD plans – like all  
Part D plans – must provide on their websites under 42 CFR 423.128(b)(5)
and (d)(2). While  
prescription drug claims would have to be made available through the API
no later than 1  
business day of the MA-PD plan’s receipt of that information, we are not
proposing a specific  
timeframe for pharmacy directory or formulary information to be
available (or updated) through  
the API. We intend that the requirements in 42 CFR part 423 requiring
when and how  
information related to pharmacy directories be updated will apply to the
provision of this  
information through the API; we solicit comment specifically whether we
should address this in  
the regulation text or otherwise impose a time-frame for this
information to be made available  
through the API.  
At proposed 42 CFR 431.60(b)(5), for Medicaid FFS programs, and at 42
CFR  
457.730(b)(5) for CHIP FFS programs, states would be required to include
and update covered  
outpatient drug lists (including, where applicable, preferred drug
lists) through the API no later  
than one (1) business day after the effective date of the information or
any changes. We are  

-----

<span id="87"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**87**  
proposing to set this timeframe at one (1) business day because we
believe that it is critical for  
beneficiaries and prescribers to have this information as soon as the
information is applicable to  
coverage or in near real time since this information could improve care
and health outcomes.  
Having timely data is particularly important during urgent or emergency
situations. Medicaid  
managed care plans and CHIP managed care entities would be required to
comply with these  
requirements as well under proposed 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) and
457.1233(d)(2). We also note  
that adjudicated claims and encounter data referenced in 42 CFR
431.60(b)(1) and (2),  
438.242(b)(6), and 457.730(b)(1) and (2) include claims and encounter
data for covered  
outpatient drugs. To the extent that a state or managed care plan
utilizes a pharmacy benefit  
manager (PBM), we anticipate that, as a practical matter, the state or
managed care plan would  
need to obtain the data from the PBM in a timely manner to comply with
these proposed  
requirements.  
We request comment on these proposals.  
d. Documentation Requirements for APIs ****  
We are proposing that the specific business and technical documentation
necessary to  
interact with the proposed APIs be made freely and publicly accessible.
As discussed in section  
II.A.1 of this proposed rule, we believe transparency about API
technology is needed to ensure  
that any interested third-party application developer can easily obtain
the information needed to  
develop applications technically compatible with the organization’s API.
Transparency is also  
needed so that third-parties can understand how to successfully interact
with an organization’s  
API, including by satisfying any requirements the organization may
establish for verification of  
developers’ identity and their applications’ authenticity, consistent
with its security risk analysis  
and related organizational policies and procedures to ensure it
maintains an appropriate level of  
privacy and security protection for data on its systems.  

-----

<span id="88"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**88**  
Specifically, at 42 CFR 422.119(d), 431.60(d), 457.730(d), and 45 CFR
156.221(d), we  
propose virtually identical text to require publication of complete
accompanying documentation  
regarding the API by posting this documentation directly on the
applicable entity’s website or via  
a publicly accessible hyperlink. As previously discussed, Medicaid
managed care plans would be  
required by 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) to comply with the requirement at 42
CFR 431.60(d), and  
CHIP managed care entities would be required by 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) to
comply with the  
requirement at 42 CFR 457.730(d). In requiring that this documentation
is “publicly accessible,”  
we expect that any person using commonly available technology to browse
the Internet could  
access the information without any preconditions or additional steps
beyond downloading and  
using a third-party application to access data through the API. This is
not intended to preclude  
use of links the user would click to review the full text of lengthy
documents or access sources of  
additional information, such as if the technology’s supplier prefers to
host technical  
documentation at a centralized location. Rather, we mean “additional
steps” to include actions  
such as: collecting a fee for access to the documentation; requiring the
reader to receive a copy  
of the material via email; or requiring the user to read promotional
material or agree to receive  
future communications from the organization making the documentation
available. We  
specifically solicit comments on these points.  
We propose that the publicly accessible documentation would be required
to include, at a  
minimum, the following information:  
● API syntax, function names, required and optional parameters supported
and their data  
types, return variables and their types/structures, exceptions and
exception handling methods and  
their returns.  

-----

<span id="89"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**89**  
● The software components and configurations an application must use in
order to  
successfully interact with the API (for example, to connect and receive
data through the API) and  
process its response(s).  
● All applicable technical requirements and attributes necessary for an
application to be  
registered with any authorization server(s) deployed in conjunction with
the API.  
We note that these information requirements are similar to those ONC has
proposed for  
adoption by HHS for developers and users of health IT certified to the
API criteria proposed at  
45 CFR 170.315 (published elsewhere in this **Federal Register**), but
are proposed here to apply  
specifically to the API technology deployed by organizations subject to
the API requirements  
proposed in section III. of this proposed rule. We request comments on
this proposal.  
e. Routine Testing and Monitoring of Open APIs  
At 42 CFR 422.119(c)(2), 431.60(c)(2), 457.730(c)(2), and 45 CFR
156.221(c)(2) for  
MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, and QHP issuers
in FFEs,  
respectively, we are proposing that the API be routinely tested and
monitored to ensure it is  
functioning properly, including assessments to verify that the API is
fully and successfully  
implementing privacy and security features such as but not limited to
those minimally required  
to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security requirements in 45 CFR
part 164, 42 CFR parts  
2 and 3, and other applicable law protecting privacy and security of
individually identifiable  
health information. Medicaid managed care plans would be required by 42
CFR 438.242(b)(6) to  
comply with the requirement at 42 CFR 431.60(c), and CHIP managed care
entities would be  
required by 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2) to comply with the requirement at 42
CFR 457.730(c).  
Additionally, we note that while federal laws that regulate MA
organizations and MA  
plans supersede any state law except where noted under section
1856(b)(3) of the Act, some  
state, local, or tribal laws that pertain to privacy and security of
individually identifiable  

-----

<span id="90"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**90**  
information generally and are not specific to health insurance may also
apply to MA  
organizations and MA plans in the context of our proposal. For the other
entities regulated under  
our proposals in these various programs, we also intend the phrase
“other applicable law” to  
include federal, state, tribal or local laws that apply to the entity.  
We propose this requirement to establish and maintain processes to
routinely test and  
monitor the open APIs to ensure they are functioning properly,
especially with respect to their  
privacy and security features. Under our proposal, MA organizations,
Medicaid and CHIP FFS  
programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and
QHP issuers in FFEs  
would have to implement, properly maintain, update (as appropriate), and
routinely test  
authentication features that will be used to verify the identity of
individual enrollees who seek to  
access their claims and encounter data and other PHI through the API.
Similarly, compliance  
with our proposed requirements would mean that these entities must
implement, maintain, update  
(as appropriate), and routinely test authorization features to ensure an
individual enrollee or their  
personal representative can only access claims and encounter data or
other PHI that belongs to  
that enrollee. As is the case under existing HIPAA requirements, where
an enrollee is also a  
properly designated personal representative of another enrollee, the
HIPAA covered entity must  
provide for appropriate access to the information of the enrollee that
has designated the personal  
representative, just as they would if the personal representative were
an enrollee of the same  
plan.  
Similarly, at proposed 45 CFR 156.221(c)(2), QHP issuers in FFEs would
be required to  
routinely test and monitor their API to confirm that it is functioning
properly.  
  
We request comment on these proposals.

f. Compliance with Existing Privacy and Security Requirements  
In the hands of a HIPAA covered entity or its business associate,
individually identifiable  
patient claims, encounter data, and other health information are PHI as
defined at 45 CFR  
160.103. Ensuring the privacy and security of the claims, encounter, and
other health information  
when it is transmitted through the API is of critical importance.
Therefore, we remind MA  
organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed
care plans, CHIP  
managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs that mechanisms and
practices to release PHI,  
including but not limited to authorization and authentication protocols
and practices must  
provide protection sufficient to comply with HIPAA privacy and security
regulations at 45 CFR  
part 164 and other law (whether federal, state, tribal or local) that
may apply based on the  
specific circumstances. Under this proposal, the entities subject to
these requirements would  
need to continuously ensure that all authorization and authentication
mechanisms provide  
sufficient protections to enrollee PHI and that they function as
intended. We specifically request  
public comment on whether existing privacy and security standards,
including but not limited to  
those in 45 CFR part 164, are sufficient with respect to these
proposals, or whether additional  
privacy and security standards should be required by CMS as part of this
proposal.  
g. Issues Related to Denial or Discontinuation of Access to the API  
As discussed in section II.A of this proposed rule, HIPAA covered
entities must comply  
with patients’ requests to receive their data under the HIPAA Right of
Access, including having  
to transmit patient data to a third party. As noted in guidance from
OCR, disagreement with the  
individual about the worthiness of the third party as a recipient of
PHI, or even concerns about  
what the third party might do with the PHI, are not grounds for denying
a request.[27](CMSs.html#91)However,
a

covered entity is not expected to tolerate unacceptable levels of risk
to the PHI held by the  
covered entity in its systems, as determined by its own risk
analysis.[28](CMSs.html#92)Accordingly, it may be  
appropriate for an organization to deny or terminate specific
applications’ connection to its API  
under certain circumstances in which the application poses an
unacceptable risk to the PHI on its  
systems or otherwise violates the terms of use of the API technology.  
At 42 CFR 422.119(e), 431.60(e), 438.242(b)(6), 457.730(e),
457.1233(d)(2) and 45 CFR  
156.221(e) for MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs,
Medicaid managed  
care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs, we are
proposing to specify  
the circumstances under which these regulated entities, which are all
HIPAA-covered entities  
subject to HIPAA privacy and security requirements, may decline to
establish or may terminate a  
third-party application’s connection to the covered entity’s API while
remaining in compliance  
with our proposed requirement to offer patients access through open
APIs. We intend for this  
proposal to be consistent with the HIPAA rules, and we note that these
circumstances apply to  
specific applications, rather than the third party itself. For instance,
were the individual to request  
that the HIPAA covered entity provide the individual’s information
through other means than  
through an API to the same third party that would have received it on
the individual’s behalf  
through an application which has been denied access, the covered entity
would be required to  
approach that request as if the application’s API request or connection
had not occurred.  
Specifically, we propose that an MA organization, state Medicaid and
CHIP FFS  
program, Medicaid managed care plan, CHIP managed care entity, or QHP
issuer in an FFE,  
may, in accordance with HIPAA, deny access to the API if the entity
reasonably determines that  
allowing that application to connect or remain connected to the API
would present an

unacceptable level of risk to the security of PHI on the organization’s
systems. We further  
propose that this determination must be based on objective, verifiable
criteria that are applied  
fairly and consistently across all applications through which enrollees
seek to access their  
electronic health information as defined at 45 CFR 171.102, including
but not limited to criteria  
that may rely on automated monitoring and risk mitigation tools.  
Where we propose to require access through open APIs to otherwise
publicly available  
information, such as provider directories, the entities subject to our
proposal may also deny or  
terminate an application’s connection to the API when it makes a similar
determination about  
risk to its systems. However, depending on how the organization’s
systems are designed and  
configured, we recognize that the criteria and tolerable risk levels
appropriate to assessing an  
application for connection to an API for access to publicly available
information may differ from  
those required for API access to non-published PII.  
We also anticipate that, where an application’s connection has been
terminated under  
these circumstances, it might be feasible in some instances for the
organization to allow the  
application to re-connect to the API if and when the flaw or compromise
of the application has  
been addressed sufficiently that the organization can no longer fairly
say the application’s API  
connection continues to pose an unacceptable risk.  
We request comment on these proposals.  
h. Enrollee and Beneficiary Resources Regarding Privacy and Security  
As discussed in section II.A. of this proposed rule, we are committed to
maximizing  
enrollees’ access to and control over their health information. We
believe this calls for providing  
enrollees that would access data under our proposal with essential
information about the privacy  
and security of their information, and what to do if they believe they
have been misled or  
deceived about an application’s terms of use or privacy policy.

<span id="94"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

**94**  
At 42 CFR 422.119(g), 431.60(f), and 457.730(f), and 45 CFR 156.221(g),
we propose  
to require MA organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs,
Medicaid managed care  
plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs, to make
available to their current  
and former enrollees certain information about: factors to consider in
selecting a health  
information management application, practical strategies to help them
safeguard the privacy and  
security of their data, and how to submit complaints to OCR or FTC.
These proposed obligations  
are proposed to apply to Medicaid managed care plans and CHIP managed
care entities through  
cross-references proposed in 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6) and 457.1233(d)(2).  
The general information about the steps individuals can take to help
protect the privacy  
and security of their health information should not be limited to, but
should specifically include  
and emphasize the importance of understanding the privacy and security
practices of any  
application to which they entrust their data. Information about
submitting complaints should  
include both specific contact information for the OCR and FTC complaints
processes and a brief  
overview, in simple and easy-to-understand language, of: what
organizations are HIPAA covered  
entities, OCR’s responsibility to oversee compliance with HIPAA, and
FTC’s complementary  
responsibility to oversee unfair and deceptive practices, including by
non-covered entities that  
may offer direct-to-consumer health information management
applications.  
We propose that this information must be made available on the website
of the  
organization subject to this proposed requirement, and through other
appropriate mechanisms  
through which the organization ordinarily communicates with enrollees.
This could include  
customer portals, online customer service help desks, and other
locations, such as any portals  
through which enrollees and former enrollees might request disclosure of
their data to a third-  
party application through the organization’s API. We are also proposing
that the entity must  
make this information available in non-technical, consumer-friendly
language.  

-----

<span id="95"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**95**  
We anticipate that organizations could meet the requirement to provide
information to  
current and former enrollees in whole or in part using materials
designed for consumer audiences  
that are available on the HHS website (for example, content and
materials such as those
available  
at[https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/right-to-access/index.html)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/right-to-access/index.html)
and FTC website (for  
example, content and materials such as those available
at  
[https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/online-security)](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/online-security)
However, we note that whether the  
organization chooses to draft its own resource materials to provide the
required information or to  
rely on governmental or other sources for such materials, the
organization will be responsible for  
ensuring that the content of the materials remains current as relevant
law and policy may evolve  
over time. We seek comment on this proposal, and we invite additional
comments on what  
specific information resources in addition to those already available on
the websites noted above  
would be most useful to entities in meeting this requirement. We
anticipate using this feedback  
to help inform HHS planning and prioritization of informational resource
development work in  
addition to making a decision on the final rule regarding this
proposal.  
i. Exceptions or Provisions Specific to Certain Programs or
Sub-Programs  
We are proposing certain exceptions or specific additional provisions as
part of this  
proposed rule for certain QHPs in FFEs and certain types of MA plans,
respectively. Under  
sections 1856, 1857, and 1860D-12(b)(3) of the Act, we proposed at 42
CFR 422.119(b)(2) to  
include additional requirements that would apply specifically to MA
organizations that offer  
Medicare Advantage-Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plans. The organizations
offering these MA-  
PD plans must comply with MA requirements in 42 CFR part 422 for Part A,
Part B and non-  
drug supplemental benefits; they must comply with Part D requirements in
42 CFR part 423 for  
the Part D prescription drug benefit. These additional requirements
would ensure that enrollees  
of MA-PD plans can easily access the information they need in order to
adhere to their care  

-----

<span id="96"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**96**  
plans. Including this information in an open API allows non- MA
third-party applications to  
properly use, aggregate, and display plan data in different contexts,
enabling another means of  
accessing information for patients and more options for comparing and
understanding plan  
information in a way that can best serve their individual needs.  
Specifically, at 42 CFR 422.119 (b)(2)(i), we propose to require MA
organizations make  
standardized data concerning adjudicated Part D claims, including
remittances and enrollee cost-  
sharing, available through the API to enrollees covered under a MA-PD
plan. We propose to  
require that this information be made available no later than one (1)
business day after a claim is  
adjudicated. This would ensure that data provided through the API would
be the most current  
data available, which may be critical if the data is being used by a
provider who is basing clinical  
decisions on the data. To the extent that an MA organization offering
MA-PD plans utilizes a  
PBM, the MA organization would be required to obtain the data from the
PBM in order to  
comply with these requirements.  
Related to QHP issuers, we propose two exceptions to this proposed rule.
First, we  
propose that the requirements proposed in 45 CFR 156.221(a) not apply to
issuers of SADPs in  
the FFEs. In contrast to QHP issuers of medical plans, issuers of SADPs
offer enrollees access to  
a unique and specialized form of medical care. We believe the proposed
standards and health IT  
investment would be overly burdensome for SADP issuers as related to
their current enrollment  
and premium intake and could result in SADP issuers no longer
participating in FFEs, which  
would not be in the best interest of enrollees. Additionally, we believe
much of the benefit to  
enrollees from requiring issuers of QHPs to make patient data more
easily available through a  
standard format depends upon deployment of open API technology that
conforms to standards  
proposed by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (published elsewhere
in this **Federal**  
**Register**) and a corresponding energetic response by the developer
community in developing  

-----

<span id="97"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**97**  
innovative, useful, usable, and affordable consumer-facing applications
through which plan  
enrollees can conveniently access, use, and share their information as
they choose. Through our  
proposals in this section to require implementation of open API
technology in the Medicare,  
Medicaid and CHIP programs, as well as by QHP issuers in FFEs, we would
anticipate  
significantly expanding the implementation of open APIs by medical
plans. However, we do not  
anticipate similar widespread usage with respect to SADPs. Therefore, we
believe that the utility  
of access to issuers’ data is less applicable to dental coverage, and do
not believe it would be in  
the interest of qualified individuals and qualified employers in the
state in which an FFE operates  
to not certify SADPs because they do not provide patient access to their
data through an openly-  
published API. We seek comment on whether we should apply this policy to
SADP issuers in the  
future.  
We also propose to provide an exceptions process through which an FFE
may certify  
health plans that do not provide patient access through an
openly-published API, but otherwise  
meet the requirements for QHP certification. We propose in 45 CFR
156.221(h)(1) that if a plan  
applying for QHP certification to be offered through an FFE does not
provide patient access to  
their data through an open API, the issuer must include as part of its
QHP application a narrative  
justification outlining the reasons why the plan cannot reasonably
satisfy the requirements in  
proposed 45 CFR 156.221(a),(b), or (c), the impact of non-compliance
upon enrollees, the  
current or proposed means of providing health information to enrollees,
and proposed solutions  
and timeline to achieve API compliance. In 45 CFR 156.221(h)(2), we
propose that an FFE may  
grant an exception to the requirement to provide enrollees access to
data through open API  
technology if the FFE determines that making available such health plan
is in the interest of  
qualified individuals and qualified employers in the state in which the
FFE operates. We  
anticipate that this exception would be provided in limited situations.
For example, we would  

-----

<span id="98"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**98**  
consider providing an exception for small issuers, issuers who are only
in the individual or small  
group market, financially vulnerable issuers, or new entrants to the
market who demonstrate that  
deploying open API technology consistent with the required
interoperability standards would  
pose a significant barrier to the issuer’s ability to provide coverage
to consumers, and not  
certifying the issuer’s QHP or QHPs would result in consumers having few
or no plan options in  
certain areas. We seek comment on other circumstances in which the FFE
should consider  
providing an exception.  
j. Applicability and Timing  
At 42 CFR 422.119(h) and 45 CFR 156.221(i), we are proposing specific
provisions  
regarding applicability and timing for MA organizations and QHP issuers
in FFEs that would be  
subject to our proposal. We are not proposing specific regulation text
for 42 CFR 431.60 or  
438.242 because we intend to make the regulation text effective on the
applicable date discussed  
below. We expect that state Medicaid and CHIP agencies will be aware of
upcoming new  
regulations and planning for compliance with them when they are
effective and applicable, even  
if the new regulation is not yet codified in the CFR; we similarly
expect that such agencies will  
ensure that their managed care plans/entities will be prepared for
compliance. Unlike Medicaid  
state agencies and managed care plans and state CHIP agencies and
managed care entities, MA  
organizations and QHP issuers in FFEs generally are subject to rules
regarding bid and  
application submissions to CMS in advance of the coverage period; for
example, MA  
organizations must submit bids to CMS by the first Monday in June of the
year before coverage  
starts in order to be awarded an MA contract. In order to ensure that
these requirements for MA  
organizations and QHP issuers in FFEs are enforceable and reflected in
the bids and applications  
these entities submit to us in advance of when the actual requirements
must be met, we propose  

-----

<span id="99"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**99**  
to codify the actual compliance and applicability dates of these
requirements. We solicit  
comment on this approach.  
For MA organizations, under 42 CFR 422.119(h), we are proposing that the
requirements  
would be effective beginning January 1, 2020. Under this proposal, the
requirements we propose  
for 42 CFR 422.119 would be applicable for all MA organizations with
contracts to offer any  
MA plan on that date and thereafter. We request feedback about this
proposed timing from the  
industry. In particular, we are interested in information and request
comment from MA  
organizations about their current capability to implement an API
consistent with this proposal  
and the costs associated with compliance by January 1, 2020, versus
compliance by a future date.  
For Medicaid FFS at 42 CFR 431.60, CHIP agencies that operate FFS
systems at 42 CFR  
457.730, Medicaid managed care plans at 42 CFR 438.242(b)(6), and CHIP
managed care  
entities at 42 CFR 457.1233(d)(2), we are proposing that the API
requirements would be  
effective beginning July 1, 2020, regardless of when the managed care
contract started. Given  
the expected date of publication of this proposed rule and potential
final rule, we believe July 1,  
2020, would provide state Medicaid agencies and CHIP agencies that
operate FFS systems,  
Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP managed care entities sufficient
time to implement. We  
solicit comment on this proposal and whether additional flexibility
would be necessary to take  
into account the contract terms that states use for their Medicaid
managed care plans.  
For CHIP, we are aware that some states do not provide any benefits on a
FFS basis, and  
we do not intend for those states to implement an API outside their
managed care plans.  
Therefore, we also propose in 42 CFR 457.700(c) that separate CHIP
agencies that provide  
benefits exclusively through managed care entities may meet the
requirements of 42 CFR  
457.730 by requiring the managed care entities to meet the requirements
of 42 CFR  
457.1233(d)(2) beginning July 1, 2020.  

-----

<span id="100"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**100**  
For QHP issuers in FFEs, we propose in 45 CFR 156.221(i) that these
requirements  
would be applicable for plan years beginning on or after January 1,
2020. We seek comment on  
the timing of these requirements, and on how long issuers, particularly
smaller issuers, anticipate  
it would take to come into compliance with these requirements.  
We believe that these proposals would help to create a health care
information ecosystem  
that allows and encourages the health care market to tailor products and
services to compete for  
patients, thereby increasing quality, decreasing costs, and helping them
live better, healthier  
lives. Additionally, under these proposals, physicians would be able to
access information on  
their patient’s current prescriptions and services by reviewing the
information with the patient on  
the patient’s personal device or by the patient sharing data with the
provider’s EHR system,  
which would save time during appointments and ultimately improve the
quality of care delivered  
to beneficiaries. Most health care professionals and consumers have
widespread access to the  
internet, providing many access points for viewing health care data over
secure connections. We  
believe that these proposed requirements would significantly improve
beneficiaries’ experiences  
by providing a secure mechanism through which they can access their data
in a standardized,  
computable format.  
These proposals are designed to empower patients by making sure that
they have access  
to health information about themselves in a usable digital format and
can make decisions about  
how, with whom, and for what uses they will share it. By making claims
data readily available  
and portable to the enrollee, these initiatives support efforts to move
our health care system away  
from a FFS payment system that pays for volume and toward a payment
system that pays for  
value and quality by reducing duplication of services, adding efficiency
to patient visits to  
providers; and, facilitating identification of fraud, waste, and abuse.
Data interoperability is  
critical to the success of new payment models and approaches that
incentivize high quality,  

-----

<span id="101"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**101**  
efficient care. All of the health care providers for a patient need to
coordinate their care for a  
value-based system to work, and that requires information to be securely
shareable in  
standardized, computable formats. Moreover, patients need to understand
and be actively  
involved in their care under a value-based framework. We are committed
to supporting  
requirements that focus on these goals, and we believe that these
specific proposals in this  
proposed rule support these efforts.  
k. Request for Information on Information Sharing Between Payers and
Providers through APIs  
This proposed rule requires the implementation of open APIs for making
accessible data  
that a third-party could use to create applications for patients to
access data in order to coordinate  
and better participate in their medical treatment. While in some
instances, direct provider to  
health plan transmission of health information may be more appropriate
than sharing data  
through an open API, in other instances a patient may wish to send a
provider a copy of their  
health information via another health care provider’s API. In such
cases, patients could direct the  
payer to transmit the health information to a third party application
(for example, an application  
offered by a health care provider to obtain patient claims and encounter
data, as well as lab test  
results (if applicable) on a one-off and as-needed basis. To the extent
a HIPAA covered entity  
uses a third party application to offer patients access to their
records, another HIPAA covered  
entity may be able to obtain an individual's health information from the
app for treatment,  
payment, or certain health care operations, if it could do so in
accordance with HIPAA without  
need of an individual’s authorization. (*See* 45 CFR 164.506.) Under
other laws, providers may  
need to obtain specific individual consent to obtain health information
related to care provided  
by a behavioral health provider, treatment received at a substance use
disorder treatment facility,  
certain 42 CFR part 2-covered diagnoses or other claims-related
information, or labs that suggest  
a part 2 diagnosis. We do not intend to expand any scope of authority to
access patient data nor  

-----

<span id="102"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**102**  
to contravene existing requirements related to disclosure of PHI under
the HIPAA Rules and  
other legal standards, but instead specify a new and additional
mechanism by which to share  
health information as directed by the individual, through the use of API
technology in  
compliance with all existing federal, state, local, and tribal privacy
and security laws.  
In the future, we anticipate payers and providers may seek to coordinate
care and share  
information in such a way as to request data on providers’ or a plan’s
patient/insured overlapping  
population(s) in one transaction. Effective care coordination between
plans and providers can  
inform health care providers about where their patients are receiving
care to better understand the  
totality of their healthcare needs and manage their care. We have heard
that being aware of  
urgent care or emergency department visits allows clinicians to arrange
appropriate follow-up,  
modify treatments, and update records if services are provided (for
example, tetanus boosters  
given with a laceration treated in urgent care). The accompanying
proposals in Section X. of this  
proposed rule, to amend the conditions of participation regarding
notification of patient  
discharge, further support the ability of clinicians to arrange and
affirm such appropriate follow-  
up care. Having a complete record of tests done at specialists’ offices
can reduce duplicate  
testing. Having a complete list of clinicians caring for a patient
facilitates appropriate notification  
if treatments are changed or procedures are planned that may impact the
other clinicians’  
treatment plan. We have heard from participants in our accountable care
programs and models  
that organizations taking risk for their patient populations need to
have a complete picture of the  
patients’ needs to better budget for appropriate resources. This may be
particularly relevant  
during disasters or public health emergencies when patients are not able
to access their normal  
sources of care and/or health care facilities are overwhelmed due to
patient surge.  
We believe there are a variety of transmission solutions that may be
employed to share  
data regarding a provider’s and plan’s overlapping patient populations.
For instance, some  

-----

<span id="103"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**103**  
geographic areas might have regional health information exchanges that
could coordinate such  
transmissions. Elsewhere, direct provider-to-provider and plan-to-plan
exchange might be more  
appropriate. Plans could participate in direct exchange through existing
trusted networks, or  
beneficiary-facing third party applications could meet this potential
future requirement.  
We seek comment for possible consideration in future rulemaking on the
feasibility of  
providers being able to request a download on a shared patient
population, and whether such a  
process could leverage the APIs described in sections II.A.3. and III.C.
of this proposed rule. We  
seek comment on requirements for patient notice and consent, and
applicable legal and  
regulatory requirements, and whether or how this data transfer could be
cumulative over time  
and between various providers. We seek input on the utility to providers
of obtaining all of their  
patients’ utilization history in a timely and comprehensive fashion. We
also seek input on  
potential unintended consequences that could result from allowing a
provider to access or  
download information about a shared patient population from payers
through an open API.  
Finally, we seek comment on the associated burden on plans to exchange
this data, as well as the  
identification other potential statutory or regulatory barriers to
exchanging this data.  
**IV. API Access to Published Provider Directory Data**  
A. Interoperability Background and Use Cases  
The proposals described in section III of this proposed rule primarily
focus on patient  
access to their data through a standardized, transparent API; however,
we have also proposed  
that entities subject to these proposals make available certain
plan-level data through the API. In  
this section, we provide additional context for the proposal related to
making provider directory  
information available through the API, including ways in which this
proposal may differ from  
our other proposals related to accessibility of patient data.

Provider directories make key information about health care
professionals and  
organizations available to help consumers identify a provider when they
enroll in an insurance  
plan or as new health needs arise. For example, such information might
include hours of  
operation, languages spoken, specialty/services, availability for new
patients. Provider  
directories also function as a resource used by the provider community
to discover contact  
information of other providers to facilitate referrals, transitions of
care, and care coordination for  
enrollees.  
The current applicable regulations for MA plans (42 CFR 422.111) and
Medicaid and  
CHIP managed care plans (42 CFR 438.10(e)(2)(vi) and (h) and 457.1207,
respectively) require  
that provider directories be made available to enrollees and potential
enrollees in hard copy and  
on the plan’s website. Section 1902(a)(83) of the Act requires state
Medicaid agencies to publish  
a directory of certain physicians on the public website of the State
agency. A regulation for  
QHPs in FFEs (45 CFR 156.230(b)) requires public access to the QHP’s
provider directory in  
addition to distribution and access for enrollees. In addition to
directing that this information be  
accessible, the current regulations also address the content of such
directories and the format and  
manner in which MA plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care
entities, and  
QHP issuers in FFEs make the information available.  
Making this required provider directory information available to
enrollees and  
prospective enrollees through an API could support development of
applications (whether  
standalone or integrated with providers’ EHR technology) that would pull
in current information  
about available providers to meet enrollees’ current needs. For
instance, as part of a referral  
lookup use case, API access to a provider directory could allow for a
referring provider’s health  
IT to enable either the enrollee or the provider to easily identify
up-to-date contact information  
obtained from the directory through an API, and securely send the
receiving health care provider

<span id="105"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

**105**  
the patient information needed to provide safe, high-quality care
sensitive to the patient’s  
preferences. Broad availability of provider directory data through
interoperable API technology  
would also allow for innovation in applications or other services that
help enrollees and  
prospective enrollees to more easily compare provider networks while
they are considering their  
options for changing health plans. Finally, a consistent, FHIR-based
API-driven approach to  
making provider directory data accessible could reduce provider burden
by enabling payers/plans  
to share more widely basic information about the providers in their
networks, such as provider  
type, specialty, contact information, and whether or not they are
accepting new patients.  
B. Broad API Access to Provider Directory Data  
In sections II.A.3. and III.C. of this proposed rule, we propose to
require MA  
organizations, state Medicaid and CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed
care plans, and CHIP  
managed care entities to make standardized information about their
provider networks available  
through API technology, so that third party software could access and
publish that information.  
Such availability would be for current enrollees, prospective enrollees
and possibly the general  
public to the extent existing regulations require that information to be
disclosed beyond current  
enrollees. We propose to require that the API technology conform to the
API standards proposed  
by ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.215 (published elsewhere in this
**Federal Register**).  
At this time, because QHP issuers in FFEs are already required to make
provider directory  
information available in a specified, machine-readable
format[29](CMSs.html#105), we do not propose these as  
requirements for QHP issuers. However, we seek comment as to whether
this same requirement  
should apply to QHP issuers, or if such a requirement would be overly
burdensome for them.  
We note that, since the provider directory information we are proposing
to require be  
available through the API is already available and accessible to
enrollees without cost to them,

this information should be as accessible through the API as it is
required to be when posted on  
the organization’s websites. Therefore, the security protocols proposed
at 45 CFR 170.215 that  
are specific to authenticating users and confirming individuals’
authorization or request to  
disclose their personal information to a specific application would not
apply to public access to  
provider directory information through APIs. While we are aware the
organization will  
nevertheless need to take appropriate steps to mitigate the potential
security risks of allowing any  
application to connect to the API through which it offers provider
directory access, we  
emphasize that these steps should be appropriate to the level of risk
associated with the specific  
use case of accessing otherwise public information through API
technology. Those wishing to  
access this data should not be unduly burdened by security protocols
that are not necessary to  
provide the appropriate degree of protection for the organization’s
systems and data. **  
**  
As referenced in sections II. and III. of this proposed rule, we intend
to develop  
additional guidance, incorporating feedback from industry that provides
implementation best  
practices relevant to FHIR-conformant open APIs to help organizations
subject to the  
requirements proposed in this rulemaking. To that end, we solicit
comment on what specific  
resources would be most helpful to organizations implementing APIs under
requirements  
proposed in this proposed rule.  
**V. Health Information Exchange and Care Coordination Across Payers:
Establishing a**  
**Coordination of Care Transaction to Communicate Between Plans**  
We are proposing a new requirement for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans,
Medicaid  
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHPs in the FFEs to
require these plans to  
maintain a process to coordinate care between plans by exchanging, at a
minimum, the USCDI at  
enrollee request at the specific times specified in the proposed
regulation text. Understanding  
that this information could already be available for exchange between
plans, this proposal is  

-----

<span id="107"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**107**  
specifically requiring this information sharing not only occur when
initiated by an enrollee  
request, but that the information requested, in the form of the USCDI
data set, would then be  
incorporated into the recipient plan’s systems. The USCDI (Version 1)
data set would have to be  
sent to another plan that covers the enrollee or a recipient identified
by the enrollee at any time  
during coverage or up to 5 years after coverage ends, and the plan would
have to receive the  
USCDI (version 1) data set from any health plan that covered the
enrollee within the preceding 5  
years. Under our proposal we are supporting patient directed
coordination of care and each of  
the plans subject to the requirement would, upon an enrollee’s request:
(1) accept the data set  
from another plan that had covered the enrollee within the previous 5
years; (2) send the data set  
at any time during an enrollee’s enrollment and up to 5 years later, to
another plan that currently  
covers the enrollee; and (3) send the data set at any time during
enrollment or up to 5 years after  
enrollment has ended to a recipient identified by the enrollee.  
As we discussed in section III.C.2. of this proposed rule, this proposal
is based on our  
authority under sections 1856(b) and 1857(e) of the Act to adopt
standards and contract terms for  
MA plans; section 1902(a)(4) of the Act to adopt methods of
administration for state Medicaid  
plans, including requirements for Medicaid managed care plans (MCOs,
PIHPs, and PAHPs);  
section 2101(a) of the Act for CHIP managed care entities (MCOs, PIHPs,
and PAHPs); and  
section 1311(e)(1)(B) of the ACA for QHP issuers in an FFE (not
including SADP issuers). We  
believe that our proposal will help to reduce provider burden and
improve patient access to their  
health information through coordination of care between health plans. We
also note that the  
CHIP regulations incorporate and apply, through an existing
cross-reference at 42 CFR  
457.1216, the Medicaid managed care plan requirements codified at 42 CFR
438.62(b)(1)(vi).  
Therefore, the proposal for Medicaid managed care plans described above
will also apply to  
CHIP managed care entities without new regulation text in part 457. We
are proposing that this  

-----

<span id="108"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**108**  
new requirement would be effective starting January 1, 2020 for MA
plans, Medicaid managed  
care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs. Among
other topics related to  
this proposal, we solicit comments on this proposed effective date.  
We propose to codify this new requirement at 42 CFR 422.119(f)(1) for
MA  
organizations; at 42 CFR 438.62(b)(1)(vi) for Medicaid managed care
plans (and by extension  
under existing rules in part 457, to CHIP managed care entities); and at
45 CFR 156.221(c) for  
QHPs in FFEs. This proposed new requirement is virtually identical for
MA plans, Medicaid  
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in FFEs,
with modifications  
in the proposal necessary for specific plans types to account for the
program needs of the MA  
program, Medicaid and CHIP managed care programs, and QHP program. Our
proposed  
regulation text references the content standard adopted at 45 CFR
170.213, which ONC is  
proposing as the USCDI Version 1 data set (published elsewhere in this
**Federal Register**). We  
believe that exchanging this minimum data would help both plan enrollees
and health care  
providers coordinate care and reduce administrative burden to ensure
that plans provide  
coordinated high-quality care in an efficient and cost-effective way
that protects program  
integrity.  
Leveraging interoperability to facilitate care coordination among plans
can, with  
thoughtful execution, significantly reduce unnecessary care, as well as
ensure that health care  
providers are able to spend their time providing care rather than
performing unnecessary  
administrative tasks. We believe that use of the USCDI to exchange
information furthers care  
coordination. For instance, effective information exchange between plans
could improve care  
coordination by reducing the need for health care providers to write
unneeded letters of medical  
necessity; by reducing instances of inappropriate step therapy; and by
reducing repeated  
utilization reviews, risk screenings, and assessments. It can also
streamline prior authorization

<span id="109"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

**109**  
processes and reduce instances where an enrollee’s health care provider
needs to intervene  
personally with the enrollee’s MA plan, Medicaid managed care plan, CHIP
managed care  
entity, or QHP in the FFE to ensure his or her patient received the
necessary treatment. This  
addresses concerns stakeholders have previously raised with CMS and ONC
regarding such  
administrative burdens, as the USCDI standard contains many of the data
points required to more  
effectively coordinate care.  
In addition to the benefits for care coordination at the plan level and
reduced provider  
burden, we note that once the combined health information, specified by
the USCDI standard,  
from a prior plan is available to the patient’s current plan, the
enrollee would also have access to  
multiple years of their health information through the proposed patient
access API discussed in  
section III of this proposed rule. The USCDI (Version 1) data set
includes laboratory results and  
tests, medications, health concerns, assessment and plan of treatment,
care teams, clinical notes,  
and other data points essential for care coordination. This would
provide the patient with a more  
comprehensive history of their medical care, helping them to make better
informed health care  
decisions. We seek comments on how plans might combine records and
address error  
reconciliation or other factors in establishing a more longitudinal
record for each patient.  
We propose to allow multiple methods for electronic exchange of the
information,  
including use of the APIs proposed in section III. of this proposed
rule, to allow for patient-  
mediated exchange of payer information or direct payer-to-payer
communication, subject to  
HIPAA requirements, 42 CFR part 2, and other applicable laws. We
considered requiring the use  
of the FHIR-based API discussed in section III. of this proposed rule
for the information  
exchange; however, we understand that some geographic areas might have a
regional health  
information exchange that could coordinate such transitions for the MA
plans, Medicaid  
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHPs in the FFEs
that are subject to this  

-----

<span id="110"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****

****  
**110**  
proposal. We seek comment on whether it would be beneficial to
interoperability and patient  
care coordination for us to require the use of the FHIR-based API
discussed in section III. of this  
proposed rule, and whether this should be the only mechanism allowed for
this exchange, or  
whether multiple methods for electronic exchange of the information
should be allowed under  
this proposed policy.  
We also propose that a patient should be able to request his or her
information from their  
prior plan up to 5 years after dis-enrollment, which is considerably
less than existing data  
retention policies for some of the plans.[30](CMSs.html#110) Further, if
a plan has access to multiple years of health  
information for a patient, either due to the fact that the patient has
been enrolled with the plan for  
multiple years, or because the enrollee has requested transfer of the
health information from prior  
plans which previously covered the enrollee, we propose that the health
information would be  
incorporated into the IT and data systems of each plan that receives the
USCDI data set under  
this proposed requirement, such that the enrollee’s data would be
cumulative and move with the  
enrollee as he or she changes enrollment. For example, if a patient is
enrolled in Plan 1 in 2020  
and Plan 2 in 2021, then requests the data from Plan 1 to be sent to
Plan 2, Plan 2 would have at  
least 2 years (2020 and 2021) of health information for that patient. If
the patient moves to Plan 3  
in 2022, Plan 3 should receive both 2020 and 2021 data from Plan 2 at
the patient’s request.  
While our proposal is to require compliance (and thus exchange of these
data sets) only by MA  
plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHPs
in the FFEs, we  
hope that compliance by these plans could be the first step toward
adoption and implementation  
of these standards on a voluntary basis by other health plans and health
issuers throughout the  
health care system.  
  
30 Under 42 CFR 422.504(d) and 438.3(u), MA organizations and Medicaid
managed care plans and CHIP plans  
must retain records for at least 10 years. Under 45 CFR 156.705; 45 CFR
155.1210(b)(2), (3) and (5) QHPs in the  
FFEs must also retain records for 10 years.

Research indicates that the completeness of a patient record and the
availability of up-to-  
date and relevant health information at the point of care can have a
significant impact on patient  
outcomes.[31](CMSs.html#111)Our proposal here for MA plans, Medicaid
managed care plans, CHIP managed care  
entities, and QHPs in the FFEs to exchange a minimum data set in
particular scenarios would  
support improvement in care coordination by allowing for sharing of key
patient health  
information when an enrollee requests it. The USCDI (Version 1) data set
would have to be sent  
to another plan that covers the enrollee or a recipient identified by
the enrollee at any time during  
coverage or up to 5 years after coverage ends and the plan would have to
receive the USCDI  
(version 1) data set from any health plan that covered the enrollee
within the preceding 5 years,.  
We propose that the plans subject to this new requirement would be
required to  
exchange, at a minimum, the USCDI Version 1 data set. On behalf of HHS,
ONC has proposed  
to adopt the USCDI as a standard (published elsewhere in this **Federal
Register**), to be codified  
at 45 CFR 170.213, and our proposed regulation text cross-references
this regulation. These data  
exchanges would provide the enrollee’s new plan with a core set of data
that can be used to  
support better care coordination and improved outcomes for the enrollee.
We considered  
requiring plans to exchange all the data that we proposed be available
through an API (see  
section III. of this proposed rule) but we understand that ingesting
data and reconciling errors has  
challenges and proposed this more limited data set to address those
concerns. We are seeking  
comment on whether the USCDI data set is comprehensive enough to
facilitate the type of care  
coordination and patient access described in this proposal, or whether
additional data fields and  
data elements that would be available under our API proposal in section
III of this proposed rule,  
should also be required.

**112**  
Many key attributes of the USCDI make it suitable for the purpose
outlined in our  
proposal. The USCDI includes data classes that can be supported by
commonly used standards,  
including the Health Level Seven (HL7®) Consolidated Clinical Data
Architecture (C-CDA)  
Version 2.1 and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®)
standards for essential  
patient health information like vital signs, lab results, medications
and medication allergies. The  
USCDI establishes a minimum set of data elements that would be required
to be interoperable  
nationwide and is designed to be expanded in an iterative and
predictable way over time. The  
USCDI, at a minimum, transferred for each enrollee moving among the
plans subject to our  
proposal would greatly improve each plan’s coordination of care efforts
and spotlight areas of  
urgent need. Having this information would allow the new MA plan,
Medicaid managed care  
plan, CHIP managed care entity or a QHP in the FFE to evaluate and
review an enrollee’s  
utilization history in a timely and comprehensive fashion and thus
assist each enrollee to  
transition to the new plan with minimal disruption to care. By being
able to perform timely  
outreach to enrollees based on past and current utilization, these plans
could take steps to prevent  
unnecessary emergency room visits and lapses in medication and ongoing
care; further, they  
could proactively address any network deficiencies that may impact the
enrollee. We believe that  
having an enrollee’s utilization history in a timely and comprehensive
fashion would facilitate  
outreach and coordination efforts in ways heretofore unavailable on a
broad basis. In all, this  
ability would mean that these plans could help new enrollees transition
to new coverage rules  
and a new network with minimal disruptions to care.  
  
While our proposal is to require, at a minimum, exchange of the USCDI
Version 1 data  
set, we reiterate that we do not propose to specify the means of
exchanging this data at this time.  
While we anticipate that plans may opt to use APIs (such as those
described in section III of this  
proposed rule) as the means to exchange this data, we intend to not be
overly prescriptive as to  

-----

<span id="113"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**113**  
how USCDI data set information for applicable enrollees is exchanged as
we expect there are a  
variety of transmission solutions that may be employed. For instance,
some geographic areas  
might have a regional health information exchange that could coordinate
such transitions for the  
MA plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and
QHPs in the FFEs  
that are subject to this proposal. Elsewhere, direct plan-to-plan
exchange might be more  
appropriate, or beneficiary-facing third party applications could be
used by MA plans, Medicaid  
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHPs in the FFEs to
meet this proposed  
requirement. We also expect there may be instances where these plans may
leverage their  
connections to Health Information Exchanges to engage in the information
exchanges necessary  
to comply with this proposed rule. We expect enrolled beneficiaries to
have constant access to  
requesting an exchange of data as our proposal would require exchange of
the USCDI data set  
whenever an enrollee makes such a request, which may occur at times
other than enrollment or  
disenrollment. We request comments on other means that the applicable
plans may prefer to use  
for meeting this requirement and whether CMS might be able to leverage
its program authority  
to facilitate the data exchanges contemplated by this proposal. We
acknowledge that in some  
cases plans subject to this proposed requirement may be exchanging
patient health information  
with other plans that are not similarly required to exchange USCDI data
sets for enrollees, and  
we request comment on how to support patients and providers in those
situations.  
We believe that this proposed requirement would also support dual
eligible individuals  
who are concurrently enrolled in MA plans and Medicaid managed care
plans. Under our  
proposal, both of the dual eligible individual’s plans would be subject
to the requirement to  
exchange that individual’s data in the USCDI Version 1, which should
improve the ability of  
both plans to coordinate care based on that data. For example, when an
enrollee is initially  
eligible for only one program (that is, only for Medicare and enrolled
in a MA plan, or only for  

-----

<span id="114"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**114**  
Medicaid and enrolled in a Medicaid MCO) and then becomes dually
eligible for a second  
program, the sharing of data between the existing plan and the new plan
reduces the burden on  
the new plan, on the enrollee, and on health care providers in the new
plan regarding collecting  
information about prior utilization or health information. Rather than
completing a lengthy health  
assessment, the enrollee in this example would benefit from having
similar (or possibly the  
same) information transferred directly between the MA plan and the
Medicaid managed care  
plan under our proposal. We seek comment on how plans should coordinate
care and exchange  
information in those situations. We also seek comment on the associated
burden on plans to  
exchange the USCDI data set under our proposal. In addition, we are
interested in comments  
about potential legal barriers to exchanging the USCDI data set as would
be required under our  
proposal; for example, are there federal, state, local and tribal laws
governing privacy for  
specific use cases (such as in the care of minors or for certain
behavioral health treatments) that  
raise additional considerations we should address in this regulation or
guidance.  
We believe that activities related to this proposal may qualify as a
quality improvement  
activity (QIA) meeting the criteria described in section 2718(a)(2) of
the PHSA for purposes of  
the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) requirements for QHP issuers in an FFE
(excluding SADP  
issuers)[32](CMSs.html#114), and similar standards for treatment of
quality improvement standards applicable to  
Medicaid managed care plans (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs) under 42 CFR 438.8,
CHIP managed  
care entities under 42 CFR 457.1203(f), and MA plans under 42 CFR
422.2400 through  
422.2490. We request comments related to this assumption and its
implications.  
  
32 While this rulemaking is specific to QHP issuers participating in
FFEs, we note that to the extent other  
commercial market issuers incur similar costs for coverage sold in the
individual or group markets, those expenses  
may similarly qualify as QIA.

**VI. Care Coordination Through Trusted Exchange Networks: Trust
Exchange Network**  
**Requirements for MA Plans, Medicaid Managed Care Plans, CHIP Managed
Care**  
**Entities, and QHPs in the FFEs**  
We are proposing to require MA plans, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP
managed  
care entities, and QHPs in the FFEs (excluding SADP issuers) to
participate in trust networks in  
order to improve interoperability in these programs. We would codify
this requirement in,  
respectively, 42 CFR 422.119(f)(2), 438.242(b)(5), and 457.1233(d)
(which incorporates  
requirements in 42 CFR 438.242(b)(5) by reference) and 45 CFR 156.221.
In general, payers  
and patients’ ability to communicate between themselves and with health
care providers could  
considerably improve patient access to data, reduce provider burden, and
reduce redundant and  
unnecessary procedures. Trusted exchange networks allow for broader
interoperability beyond  
one health system or point to point connections among payers, patients,
and providers. Such  
networks establish rules of the road for interoperability, and with
maturing technology, such  
networks are scaling interoperability and gathering momentum with
participants, including  
several federal agencies, EHR vendors, retail pharmacy chains, large
provider associations, and  
others.  
The importance of a trusted exchange framework to such interoperability
is reflected in  
section 4003(b) of the Cures Act, as discussed in more detail in section
I.D. of this proposed rule.  
A trusted exchange framework allows for the secure exchange of
electronic health information  
with, and use of electronic health information from, other health IT
without special effort on the  
part of the user. Widespread payer participation in such a framework
might allow for more  
complete access and exchange of all electronically accessible health
information for authorized  
use under applicable state or federal law, which we believe would lead
to better use of such data.  
While we cannot require widespread payer participation in trust
networks, we are proposing here  

-----

<span id="116"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**116**  
to use our program authority in the MA program, Medicaid managed care
program, CHIP  
managed care program, and QHP certification program for the FFEs to
increase participation in  
trust networks and to bring the benefits of such participation to those
programs.  
We are proposing to require, effective beginning January 1, 2020, that
MA plans,  
Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities and QHPs in the
FFEs (excluding not  
stand alone SADPs) participate in a trusted exchange network. This
proposal is based on our  
authority under: sections 1856(b) and 1857(e) of the Act to adopt
standards and contract terms  
for MA plans; section 1902(a)(4) of the Act to adopt methods of
administration for the  
administration state Medicaid plans, including requirements for Medicaid
Managed Care Plans  
(MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs); section 2101(a) for CHIP managed care entities
(MCOs, PIHPs,  
and PAHPS); and section 3001(c)(9)(F)(iii) of the Public Health Service
Act and section  
1311(e)(1)(B) of the Affordable Care Act for QHP issuers in an FFE.
Under our proposal,  
participation would be required in a trusted exchange framework that
meets the following  
criteria:  
(1) The trusted exchange network must be able to exchange PHI, defined
in 45 CFR  
160.103, in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws across
jurisdictions.  
(2) The trusted exchange network must be capable of connecting both
inpatient EHRs  
and ambulatory EHRs.  
(3) The trusted exchange network must support secure messaging or
electronic querying  
by and between patients, providers and payers.  
We propose to codify these requirements for these plans at 42 CFR
422.119(f)(2) for MA  
organizations, 438.242(b)(5) for Medicaid managed care plans,
457.1233(d)(2) for CHIP  
managed care entities, and 45 CFR 156.221(d) for QHPs in the FFEs.

On January 5, 2018, ONC released the draft Trusted Exchange Framework
for public  
comment. Commenters to the draft framework, particularly payers
providing comments,  
requested that existing trust networks operating successfully be
leveraged in further advancing  
interoperability; thus, we are considering proposing in the future an
approach to payer to payer  
and payer to provider interoperability that leverages existing trust
networks to support care  
coordination and improve patient access to their data. We request
comments on this approach  
and how it might be aligned in the future with section 4003(b) of the
Cures Act. We also request  
comments on the effective date we have proposed for this requirement and
what benefits and  
challenges the plans (MA organization, Medicare managed care plans, CHIP
managed care  
entities and QHPs in the FFE) may face meeting this requirement for
additional consideration in  
future rulemaking.  
We believe that activities related to this proposal may qualify as a QIA
meeting the  
criteria described in section 2718(a)(2) of the PHSA for purposes of the
MLR requirements for  
QHP issuers in an FFE (excluding SADP issuers)[33, a](CMSs.html#117)nd

quality improvement standards applicable to Medicaid managed care plans
(MCOs, PIHPs, and

457.1203(f), and MA  
plans under 42 CFR 422.2400 through 422.2490. We request comments
related to this  
assumption and its implications.

A. Increasing the frequency of federal-state data exchanges for dually
eligible individuals.  
1\. Background  
The Medicare and Medicaid programs were originally created as distinct
programs with  
different purposes. The programs have different rules for eligibility,
covered benefits, and  
payment, and the programs have operated as separate and distinct systems
despite a growing  
number of people who depend on both programs for their health care.
There is an increasing  
need to align these programs – and the data and systems that support
them – to improve care  
delivery and the beneficiary experience for dually eligible
beneficiaries, while reducing  
administrative burden for providers, health plans, and states. The
interoperability of state and  
CMS eligibility systems is a critical part of modernizing the programs
and improving beneficiary  
and provider experiences. Improving the accuracy of data on dual
eligibility status by increasing  
the frequency of federal-state data exchanges is a strong first step in
improving how these  
systems work together.  
2\. Data Exchanges to Support State Buy-in for Medicare Parts A and B  
States and CMS routinely exchange data on who is enrolled in Medicare,
and which  
parties are liable for paying that beneficiary’s Parts A and B premiums.
These data exchanges  
support state, CMS, and SSA premium accounting, collections, and
enrollment functions.  
Section 1843 of the Act permits states to enter into an agreement with
the Secretary to facilitate  
state “buy-in,” that is, payment of Medicare premiums, in this case Part
B premiums, on behalf  
of certain individuals. For those beneficiaries covered under the
agreement, the state pays the  
beneficiary’s monthly Part B premium. Section 1818(g) of the Act
establishes the option for  
states to amend their buy-in agreement to include enrollment and payment
of the Part A premium  
for certain specified individuals. All states and the District of
Columbia have a Part B buy-in  
agreement; 36 states and the District of Columbia have a Part A buy-in
agreement.  

-----

<span id="119"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**119**  
To effectuate the state payment of Medicare Part A or Part B premiums, a
state submits  
data on a buy-in file to CMS via an electronic file transfer (EFT)
exchange setup. The state’s  
input file includes a record for each Medicare beneficiary for whom the
state is adding or  
deleting coverage, or changing buy-in status. In response, CMS returns
an updated transaction  
record that provides data identifying, for each transaction on the state
file, whether CMS  
accepted, modified, or rejected it, as well a Part A or Part B billing
record showing the state’s  
premium responsibility. In addition, the CMS file may “push” new updates
obtained from SSA  
to the state, for example, changes to the Medicare Beneficiary
Identifier number or a change of  
address.  
  
We have issued regulations for certain details of the state buy-in
processes. For Medicare  
Part A, 42 CFR 407.40 describes the option for states to amend the
buy-in agreement to cover  
Part A premiums for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs). For
Medicare Part B, 42 CFR  
406.26 codifies the process for modifying the buy-in agreement to
identify the eligibility groups  
covered. CMS subregulatory guidance, specifically Chapter 3 of the State
Buy-in Manual,[34](CMSs.html#119)  
specifies that states should exchange buy-in data with CMS at least
monthly, but describes the  
option for states to exchange buy-in data with CMS daily or weekly.
Likewise, states can choose  
to receive the CMS response data file daily or monthly. We note that 31
states and the District of  
Columbia are now submitting buy-in data to CMS daily; 28 states and the
District of Columbia  
are now receiving buy-in response files from CMS daily.  
  
While many states submit and receive buy-in files daily, some continue
to only do so on a  
monthly basis. We have become increasingly concerned about the
limitations of monthly buy-in  
data exchanges with states. The relatively long lag in updating buy-in
data means that the state is

Exchange,”[https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-  
Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/buyin\_c03.pdf.](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/buyin_c03.pdf)

not able to terminate or activate buy-in coverage sooner, so the state
or beneficiary may be  
paying premiums for longer than appropriate. In most cases, funds must
be recouped and  
redistributed –a burdensome administrative process involving debits and
payments between the  
beneficiary, state, CMS, and SSA. Additionally, transaction errors do
occur in the current data  
exchange processes. In a monthly exchange, it can take multiple months
to correct and resubmit  
an improperly processed transaction, exacerbating the delays in
appropriately assigning premium  
liability, leading to larger mispayment, recoupment, and redistribution
of premiums.  
Exchanging the buy-in data with greater frequency supports more timely
access to  
coverage. All states’ systems already have the capacity to exchange
buy-in data. We  
acknowledge that states who do not already exchange data daily will need
an initial, one-time  
systems change to do so. However, moving to a daily data exchange would
result in a net  
reduction of burden for states, and further, reduce administrative
complexity for beneficiaries  
and providers. More frequent submission of updates to individuals’
buy-in status positively  
impacts all involved. Based on our experience with the states currently
exchanging buy-in data  
daily, we have found:  
• States can terminate buy-in coverage sooner and lower the risk of
paying Part A or Part  
B premiums for individuals once they no longer qualify. Enrollees for
whom the buy-in is ending  
have less risk of a retroactive deduction from their Social Security
check due to delayed Part B  
buy-in terminations (while 42 CFR 407.48(c) limits retroactive
recoupments to a maximum of 2  
months, an unexpected deduction of up to $268 \[2 months of Part B
premiums in 2018\] is  
significant for those with incomes low enough to be dually eligible);  
• States can detect and fix errors sooner, limiting the impact of such
errors;  
• State staff can spread the workload of resolving rejected records
across the whole  
month rather than a spike when they receive the monthly CMS response
file;  

-----

<span id="121"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**121**  
• States can effectuate an earlier shift to Medicare as primary payer
for many health care  
services, for those already covered by Medicaid; ****  
• Beneficiaries newly eligible for buy-in who had been paying premiums
themselves can  
stop having the Part B premium deducted from their Social Security check
sooner; and,  
• Beneficiaries newly eligible for buy-in who could not afford Medicare
premiums can  
access Medicare Parts A and B services and providers can be assured of
coverage sooner.  
While there exist opportunities to modernize the platform for buy-in
data exchange, we  
believe that an important first step is to promote the exchange of the
most current available data.  
Section 1843(f) of the Act specifies that Part B buy-in agreements shall
contain such provisions  
as will facilitate the financial transactions of the State and the
carrier with respect to deductions,  
coinsurance, and otherwise, and as will lead to economy and efficiency
of operation” Further,  
section 1818(g)(2)(A) of the Act on Part A buy-in identifies this
section 1843(f) requirement as  
applicable to Part A buy-in. While the regulations governing buy-in
agreements (see 42 CFR  
406.26 and 407.40) are silent on the frequency of buy-in data exchanges,
current guidance  
articulates that the required buy-in data may be submitted daily,
weekly, or monthly. We are  
proposing to establish frequency requirements in the regulations at 42
CFR 406.26(a)(1) and  
407.40(c) to require all states to participate in daily exchange of
buy-in data to CMS, with  
“daily” meaning every business day, but that if no new transactions are
available to transmit,  
data would not need to be submitted on a given business day. We believe
these requirements will  
improve the economy and efficiency of operation of the “buy-in” process.
We propose that states  
would be required to begin participating in daily exchange of buy-in
data with CMS by April 1,  
2022\. We believe this effective date will allow states to phase in any
necessary operational  
changes or bundle this required change with any new systems
implementation. There are 19  
states that we anticipate will need to make a system change to send
buy-in data to CMS daily,

<span id="122"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

**122**  
and 22 states that we anticipate will need to make a system change to
receive buy-in data from  
CMS daily. We estimate the one-time cost to be a little less than
$80,000 per state, per change.  
So a state that needs to make systems updates to both send buy-in data
daily, and receive buy-in  
data daily would have a one-time cost of just under $160,000. We seek
comment on these  
proposals.  
3\. Exchange of State MMA Data Files  
States submit data on files at least monthly to CMS to identify all
dually eligible  
individuals, including full-benefit and partial-benefit dually eligible
beneficiaries (that is, those  
who get Medicaid help with Medicare premiums, and often for
cost-sharing). The file is called  
the “MMA file,” but is occasionally referred to as the “State Phasedown
file.” The MMA file  
was originally developed to meet the need to timely identify dually
eligible beneficiaries for the  
then-new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. The Medicare
Modernization Act (MMA)  
established that beginning January 1, 2006, Medicare would be primarily
responsible for  
prescription drug coverage for full-benefit dually eligible individuals;
established auto-  
enrollment of full-benefit dually eligible beneficiaries into Medicare
prescription drug plans  
(with regulations further establishing facilitated enrollment into
prescription drug plans for  
partial-benefit dually eligible beneficiaries), provided that dually
eligible beneficiaries are treated  
as eligible for the Medicare Part D Low Income Subsidy (LIS), sometimes
called Extra Help;  
defined phased down state contributions to partly finance Part D costs
for dually eligible  
beneficiaries; and required risk-adjusting capitation payments for
low-income subsidy (which  
include dually eligible) enrollees of Part D plans. To support these new
requirements, we issued  
42 CFR 423.910, establishing monthly reporting by states, in which
states would submit, at least  
monthly, a data file identifying dually eligible individuals in their
state. Over time, we used these  
files’ data on dual eligibility status to support Part C capitation
risk-adjustment, and most

<span id="123"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

**123**  
recently, to feed dual eligibility status to Part A and B eligibility
and claims processing systems  
so providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries have accurate information on
beneficiary cost-sharing  
obligations.  
It is required at 42 CFR 423.910 that states to submit at least one MMA
file each month.  
However, states have the option to submit multiple MMA files throughout
the month (up to one  
per day). Most states submit MMA data files at least weekly; however,
only 13 states submit  
MMA data files daily. As CMS now leverages MMA data on dual eligibility
status into systems  
supporting all four parts of the Medicare program, it is becoming even
more essential that dual  
eligibility status is accurate and up-to-date. Dual eligibility status
can change at any time in a  
month. Waiting up to a month for status updates can negatively impact
access to the correct level  
of benefit at the correct level of payment. Based on our experience with
states that exchange data  
daily, more frequent MMA file submissions benefit states, beneficiaries,
and providers, in a  
number of ways including:  
• Enabling an earlier transition to Medicare coverage for prescription
drugs, which  
reduces the number of claims the state pays erroneously and has to
recoup from pharmacists (that  
then have the burden of reaching out to reconcile with the new Part D
plan);  
• Effectuating an earlier shift to Medicare as primary payer for many
health care  
services;  
• Aiding timely error identification and resolution, mitigating the
payment and other  
implications of the error;  
• Supporting states that promote enrollment in integrated care by
expediting the  
enrollment into Medicare, since beneficiaries must have Medicare Parts A
and B, as well as  
Medicaid to be eligible for integrated products such as Dual-eligible
Special Needs Plans,  
Medicare-Medicaid Plans, and the Programs for All-inclusive Care for the
Elderly (PACE);  

-----

<span id="124"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**124**  
• Supporting beneficiaries to obtain access to Medicare Part D benefits
and related  
subsidies sooner, as dual eligibility status on the MMA file prompts CMS
to deem individuals  
automatically eligible for the Medicare Part D LIS and make changes to
LIS status (for  
example, reducing copayments to $0 when data indicate a move to a
nursing facility or use of  
home and community based long term care services) and auto-enroll them
into Medicare  
prescription drug coverage back to the start of dual eligibility status;
and,  
• Promoting protections for QMBs by improving the accuracy of data for
providers and  
QMBs on zero cost-sharing liability for services under Medicare Parts A
and B.  
As noted, current regulation requires that the MMA files be submitted at
least monthly.  
We have implemented “work-arounds” for lags in dual eligibility status
for Part D, including the  
“Best Available Evidence” policy (see 42 CFR 423.800(d)), as well as the
Limited Income  
Newly Eligible Transition demonstration, which provides short term drug
coverage for dually  
eligible beneficiaries with no Part D plan enrollment in a given month
(see Medicare Prescription  
Drug Benefit Manual, Chapter 3, Section 40.1.4).[35](CMSs.html#124)
While these work-arounds provide needed  
protections, more frequent data exchanges would mitigate the need for
them.  
Ensuring information on dual eligibility status is accurate and
up-to-date by increasing  
the frequency of federal-state data exchange is an important step in the
path to interoperability.  
As a result, we are proposing to update the frequency requirements in 42
CFR 423.910(d) to  
require that starting April 1, 2022, all states submit the required MMA
file data to CMS daily,  
and to make conforming edits to 42 CFR 423.910(b)(1). Daily would mean
every business day,  
but that if no new transactions are available to transmit, data would
not need to be submitted on a

given business day. We propose that states will be required to begin
submitting these data daily  
to CMS by April 1, 2022, because we believe this effective date will
allow states to phase in any  
necessary operational changes or bundle this required change with any
new systems  
implementation. There are 37 states and the District of Columbia that we
anticipate will need to  
make a system change to send MMA data to CMS daily. We estimate the
one-time cost for a  
state to be a little less than $80,000 for this MMA data systems change.
For a detailed discussion  
of the costs associated with these requirements we refer readers to
section XVI. of this proposed  
rule. We seek comment on these proposals.  
B. Request for Stakeholder Input  
In addition to the proposals recommended above, we seek public comment
for  
consideration in future rulemaking on how we can achieve greater
interoperability of federal-  
state data for dually eligible beneficiaries, including in the areas of
program integrity and care  
coordination, coordination of benefits and crossover claims, beneficiary
eligibility and  
enrollment, and their underlying data infrastructure. Specifically, we
seek comment on:  
• Whether existing regulations, as well as those proposed here,
sufficiently support  
interoperability among those serving dually eligible beneficiaries, and
if not, what additional  
steps would advance interoperability.  
• How to enhance the interoperability of existing CMS processes to share
Medicare data  
with states for care coordination and program integrity.  
• How to improve the CMS and state data infrastructure to support
interoperability (for  
example, more frequent data exchanges, common data environment, etc.).  
• For eligibility, how interoperability can provide timely, integrated
eligibility and  
enrollment status across Medicare, Medicaid, and related agencies (for
example, SSA), and

****  
**126**  
reduce the need for persons to provide, and states to collect/process,
the same demographic  
information (for example, address, income).  
• For provider enrollment in both Medicaid and Medicare, how
interoperability can  
streamline provider enrollment and reduce provider and state burden to
increase systems  
accuracy and beneficiary utilization of provider enrollment data (for
example, disability  
competence, hours of service, types of insurance accepted, etc.).  
• For coordination of benefits, including crossover claims, the
underlying changes that  
would need to be made to support interoperability (for example, coding,
file formats,  
provider/beneficiary identifier, and encounter versus FFS data).  
Please include specific examples when possible while avoiding the
transmission of  
protected information. Please also include a point of contact who can

**VIII. Information Blocking Background and Public Reporting**  
A. Information Blocking Background  
1\. Legislative Background and Policy Considerations  
The nature and extent of information blocking has come into focus in
recent years. In  
2015, at the request of the Congress, ONC submitted a Report on Health
Information  
Blocking[36](CMSs.html#126)(hereinafter referred to as the “Information
Blocking Congressional Report”), in  
which ONC commented on the then current state of technology, health IT,
and health care  
markets. Notably, ONC observed that prevailing market conditions create
incentives for some  
individuals and entities to exercise their control over electronic
health information in ways that  
limit its availability and use. Since that time, ONC and other divisions
of HHS have continued

to receive feedback regarding practices which may constitute information
blocking from  
patients, clinicians, health care executives, payers, app developers and
other technology  
companies, registries and health information exchanges, professional and
trade associations, and  
many other stakeholders. Despite significant public and private sector
efforts to improve  
interoperability and data liquidity, engagement with stakeholders
confirms that adverse  
incentives remain and continue to undermine progress toward a more
connected health system.  
Based on these economic realities and first-hand experience working with
the health IT  
industry and stakeholders, ONC concluded in the Information Blocking
Congressional Report  
that information blocking is a serious problem and recommended that the
Congress prohibit  
information blocking and provide penalties and enforcement mechanisms to
deter these harmful  
practices.  
MACRA became law in the same month that the Information Blocking
Congressional  
Report was published. Section 106(b)(2)(A) of MACRA amended section
1848(o)(2)(A)(ii) of  
the Act to require that an eligible professional must demonstrate that
he or she has not knowingly  
and willfully taken action (such as to disable functionality) to limit
or restrict the compatibility or  
interoperability of certified EHR technology, as part of being a
meaningful EHR user. Section  
106(b)(2)(B) of MACRA made corresponding amendments to section
1886(n)(3)(A)(ii) of the  
Act for eligible hospitals and, by extension, under section 1814(l)(3)
of the Act for CAHs.  
Sections 106(b)(2)(A) and (B) of MACRA provide that the manner of this
demonstration is to be  
through a process specified by the Secretary, such as the use of an
attestation. To implement  
these provisions, as discussed further below, we established and
codified attestation requirements  
to support the prevention of information blocking, which consist of
three statements containing  
specific representations about a health care provider’s implementation
and use of CEHRT. To

review our discussion of these requirements, we refer readers to the CY
2017 Quality Payment  
Program final rule (81 FR 77028 through 77035).  
Recent empirical and economic research further underscores the
complexity of the  
information blocking problem and its harmful effects. In a national
survey of health information  
organizations, half of respondents reported that EHR developers
routinely engage in  
information blocking, and a quarter of respondents reported that
hospitals and health systems  
routinely do so.[37](CMSs.html#128) Perceived motivations for
information blocking described by respondents  
included, for EHR vendors, maximizing short term revenue and competing
for new clients, and  
for hospitals and health systems, strengthening their competitive
position relative to other  
hospitals and health systems. Other research suggests that these
practices weaken competition  
among health care providers by limiting patient mobility, encouraging
consolidation, and  
creating barriers to entry for developers of new and innovative
applications and technologies  
that enable more effective uses of clinical data to improve population
health and the patient  
experience.[38](CMSs.html#128)  
In December 2016, section 4004 of the Cures Act added section 3022 of
the PHSA (the  
“PHSA information blocking provision”), which defines conduct by health
care providers,  
health IT developers, and health information exchanges and networks,
that constitutes  
information blocking. The PHSA information blocking provision was
enacted in response to  
ongoing concerns that some individuals and entities are engaging in
practices that unreasonably

limit the availability and use of electronic health information for
authorized and permitted  
purposes (see the definition of electronic health information proposed
by ONC for HHS  
adoption at 45 CFR 171.102 (published elsewhere in this **Federal
Register**)). These practices  
undermine public and private sector investments in the nation’s health
IT infrastructure and  
frustrate efforts to use modern technologies to improve health care
quality and efficiency,  
accelerate research and innovation, and provide greater value and choice
to health care  
consumers.  
  
The information blocking provision added to PHSA defines and creates
possible penalties  
and disincentives for information blocking in broad terms, working to
deter the entire spectrum  
of practices likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage
access, exchange, or use of  
electronic health information. The PHSA information blocking provision
applies to health care  
providers, health IT developers, exchanges, and networks. The
information blocking provision  
added to PHSA by the Cures Act also provides that the “Secretary,
through rulemaking, shall  
identify reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute
information blocking for  
purposes of the definition at section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA.” ONC has
taken the lead on this  
rulemaking effort, and in addition to the attestation discussed in this
section, all health care  
providers would also be subject to the separate information blocking
regulations proposed by  
ONC for HHS adoption at 45 CFR part 171 (published elsewhere in this
**Federal Register**).  
We propose to publicly report certain information about eligible
clinicians’ attestations  
under the QPP on Physician Compare and eligible hospitals’ and CAHs’
attestations under the  
Medicare FFS Promoting Interoperability Program (previously known as the
Medicare EHR  
Incentive Program) on a CMS website. As discussed below, although we
have already  
implemented what is required by sections 106(b)(2)(A) and (B) of MACRA
through the  
attestation requirements we have established in prior rulemaking (81 FR
77028 through 77035),

we believe publishing information on which eligible clinicians, eligible
hospitals, and CAHs  
have negatively attested that they have not knowingly and willfully
taken action to limit or  
restrict the compatibility or interoperability of certified EHR
technology would serve to  
discourage knowing and willful behavior that limits interoperability and
prevents the sharing of  
information discussed in both MACRA and the Cures Act.  
B. Public Reporting and Prevention of Information Blocking on Physician
Compare  
Physician Compare
[(http://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare)](http://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare)
draws its operating  
authority from section 10331(a)(1) of the Affordable Care Act.
Consistent with section  
10331(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, Physician Compare initiated a
phased approach to  
publicly reporting performance scores that provide comparable
information on quality and  
patient experience measures. A complete history of public reporting on
Physician Compare is  
detailed in the CY 2016 Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) final rule with
comment period (80 FR  
71117 through 71122). More information about Physician Compare,
including the history of  
public reporting and regular updates about what information is currently
available, can also be  
accessed on the Physician Compare Initiative website a[t
https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/physician-compare-initiative/)  
[initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/physician-compare-initiative/.](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/physician-compare-initiative/)  
As discussed in the CY 2018 Quality Payment Program final rule (82 FR
53820),  
Physician Compare has continued to pursue a phased approach to public
reporting under  
MACRA in accordance with section 1848(q)(9) of the Act. Specifically,
subparagraphs (A) and  
(D) of section 1848(q)(9) of the Act facilitate the continuation of the
phased approach to public  
reporting by requiring the Secretary to make available on the Physician
Compare Website, in an  
easily understandable format, individual MIPS eligible clinician and
group performance  
information, including: the MIPS eligible clinician’s final score; the
MIPS eligible clinician’s  
performance under each MIPS performance category (quality, cost,
improvement activities, and  

-----

<span id="131"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**131**  
Promoting Interoperability); names of eligible clinicians in Advanced
APMs and, to the extent  
feasible, the names of such Advanced APMs and the performance of such
models; and,  
aggregate information on the MIPS, posted periodically, including the
range of final scores for  
all MIPS eligible clinicians and the range of the performance of all
MIPS eligible clinicians for  
each performance category.  
In the CY 2018 Quality Payment Program final rule (82 FR 53827), we
finalized a policy  
to include an indicator on Physician Compare, as technically feasible,
for any eligible clinician or  
group who successfully meets the Promoting Interoperability performance
category. We also  
finalized a policy to include, as technically feasible, additional
information on Physician  
Compare, either on the profile pages or in the downloadable database,
including, but not limited  
to objectives, activities, or measures specified in the CY 2018 Quality
Payment Program final  
rule (82 FR 53827; see 82 FR 53663 through 53688) with respect to the
Promoting  
Interoperability performance category.  
Generally, all data available for public reporting on Physician Compare
must meet our  
established public reporting standards under 42 CFR 414.1395(b). In
addition, for each program  
year, CMS provides a 30-day preview period for any clinician or group
with QPP data being  
publicly reported on Physician Compare under 42 CFR 414.1395(d). All
data available for public  
reporting – such as final scores – are available for review and
correction during the targeted  
review process as finalized in the CY 2017 Quality Payment Program final
rule (81 FR 77392).  
Building upon the continuation of our phased approach to public
reporting and  
understanding the importance of preventing information blocking,
promoting interoperability and  
the sharing of information, we propose to make certain data about the
attestation statements on  
the prevention of information blocking referenced earlier in section
VIII.A. of this proposed rule  
available for public reporting on Physician Compare, drawing upon our
authority under section  

-----

<span id="132"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**132**  
10331(a)(2) of Affordable Care Act, which requires us to make publicly
available on Physician  
Compare information on physician performance that provides comparable
information for the  
public on quality and patient experience measures. Section 10331(a)(2)
of the Affordable Care  
Act provides that to the extent scientifically sound measures that are
developed consistent with  
the requirements of section 10331 of the Affordable Care Act are
available, such information  
shall include, to the extent practicable, an assessment of the
coordination of care and other  
information as determined appropriate by the Secretary. We believe
section 10331(a)(2) of the  
Affordable Care Act provides the statutory authority to publicly report
certain data about the  
prevention of information blocking attestation statements as an
assessment of care coordination  
and as other information determined appropriate by the Secretary.
Furthermore, the prevention of  
information blocking attestation statements are required for a clinician
to earn a Promoting  
Interoperability performance category score, which is then incorporated
into the final score for  
MIPS, and we are required to publicly report both of these scores under
section 1848(q)(9)(A) of  
the Act. Publicly posting this information as an indicator is consistent
with our finalized policy to  
publicly report, either on the profile pages or in the downloadable
database, other aspects of the  
Promoting Interoperability performance category, such as objectives,
activities, or measures  
specified in the CY 2018 Quality Payment Program final rule.  
There are three prevention of information blocking attestation
statements under 42 CFR  
414.1375(b)(3)(ii)(A) through (C) to which eligible clinicians reporting
on the Promoting  
Interoperability performance category of MIPS must attest. To report
successfully on the  
Promoting Interoperability performance category, in addition to
satisfying other requirements, an  
eligible clinician must submit an attestation response of “yes” for each
of these statements. For  
more information about these statements, we refer readers to the
preamble discussion in the CY  
2017 Quality Payment Program final rule (81 FR 77028 through 81 FR
77035).  

-----

<span id="133"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**133**  
We believe it would benefit the public to know if eligible clinicians
have attested  
negatively to the statements under 42 CFR 414.1375(b)(3)(ii) as this may
assist the patient in  
selecting a clinician or group who collaborates with other clinicians,
groups, or other types of  
health care providers by sharing information electronically, and does
not withhold information  
that may result in better care. Therefore, we are proposing to include
an indicator on Physician  
Compare for the eligible clinicians and groups that submit a “no”
response to any of the three  
statements under 42 CFR 414.1375(b)(3)(ii)(A) through (C). In the event
that these statements  
are left blank, that is, a “yes” or a “no” response is not submitted,
the attestations would be  
considered incomplete, and we would not include an indicator on
Physician Compare. We also  
propose to post this indicator on Physician Compare, either on the
profile pages or the  
downloadable database, as feasible and appropriate, starting with the
2019 performance period  
data available for public reporting starting in late 2020.  
Under 42 CFR 414.1395(b), these data must meet our established public
reporting  
standards, including that to be included on the public facing profile
pages, the data must resonate  
with website users, as determined by CMS. In previous testing with
patients and caregivers, we  
have learned that effective use of CEHRT is important to them when
making informed health  
care decisions. To determine how to best display and meaningfully
communicate the indicator on  
the Physician Compare website, the exact wording and, if applicable,
profile page indicator  
would be determined after user testing and shared with stakeholders
through the Physician  
Compare Initiative page, listservs, webinars, and other available
communication channels. We  
note this proposal is contingent upon the availability of and technical
feasibility to use these data  
for public reporting. We request comment on this proposal.

C. Public Reporting and Prevention of Information Blocking for Eligible
Hospitals and Critical  
Access Hospitals (CAHs)  
Section 1886(n)(4)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to post in an
easily  
understandable format a list of the names and other relevant data, as
determined appropriate by  
the Secretary, of eligible hospitals and CAHs who are meaningful EHR
users under the Medicare  
FFS program, on a CMS website. In addition, that section requires the
Secretary to ensure that an  
eligible hospital or CAH has the opportunity to review the other
relevant data that are to be made  
public with respect to the eligible hospital or CAH prior to such data
being made public. We  
believe certain information related to the prevention of information
blocking attestation  
statements under 42 CFR 495.40(b)(2)(i)(I)(*1*) through (*3*) would
constitute other relevant data  
under section 1886(n)(4)(B) of the Act. Specifically, we are referring
to the three prevention of  
information blocking attestation statements under 42 CFR
495.40(b)(2)(i)(I)(1) through (3) to  
which eligible hospitals and CAHs must attest for purposes of the
Promoting Interoperability  
Program. As part of successfully demonstrating that an eligible hospital
or CAH is a meaningful  
EHR user for purposes of the Promoting Interoperability Program, the
eligible hospital or CAH  
must submit an attestation response of “yes” for each of these
statements. For more information  
about these statements, we refer readers to the preamble discussion in
the CY 2017 Quality  
Payment Program final rule (81 FR 77028 through 81 FR 77035).  
We believe it would be relevant to the public to know if eligible
hospitals and CAHs have  
attested negatively to the statements under 42 CFR 495.40(b)(2)(i)(I)(1)
through (3) as it could  
indicate that they are knowingly and unreasonably interfering with the
exchange or use of  
electronic health information in ways that limit its availability and
use to improve health care. As  
we stated in the CY 2017 Quality Payment Program final rule, we believe
that addressing issues  
related to information blocking would require additional and more
comprehensive measures (81

**135**  
FR 77029). In addition, publicly posting this information would
reinforce our commitment to  
focus on increased interoperability and the appropriate exchange of
health information. We  
propose to post information on a CMS website available to the public
indicating that an eligible  
hospital or CAH attesting under the Medicare FFS Promoting
Interoperability Program  
submitted a “no” response to any of the three statements under 42 CFR
495.40(b)(2)(i)(I)(1)  
through (3). In the event that these statements are left blank, that is,
a “yes” or a “no” response is  
not submitted, the attestations would be considered incomplete, and we
would not post any  
information related to these attestation statements for that hospital or
CAH. We propose to post  
this information starting with the attestations for the EHR reporting
period in 2019, and we  
expect the information would be posted in late 2020. In accordance with
section 1886(n)(4)(B)  
of the Act, we propose to establish a process for each eligible hospital
and CAH to review the  
information related to their specific prevention of information blocking
attestation statements  
before it is publicly posted on a CMS website. Specifically, for each
program year, we propose a  
30-day preview period for an eligible hospital or CAH to review this
information before it is  
publicly posted. During the 30-day preview period, we propose that all
of the information that  
we would publicly post would be available for the eligible hospital or
CAH to review, and we  
would consider making changes to the information on a case-by-case basis
(for example, in the  
event the eligible hospital or CAH identifies an error, and we
subsequently determine that the  
information is not accurate). Additional information on the review
process will be provided  
outside of the rulemaking process through the usual communication
channels for the program.  
We invite comments on this proposal.

**IX. Provider Digital Contact Information**  
A. Background  
Congress required the Secretary to create a provider digital contact
information index in  
section 4003 of the Cures Act. This index must include all individual
health care providers and  
health care facilities, or practices, in order to facilitate a
comprehensive and open exchange of  
patient health information. Congress gave the Secretary the authority to
use an existing index or  
to facilitate the creation of a new index. In comments received on the
FY 2019 IPPS proposed  
rule RFI, there was strong support for a single, public directory of
provider digital contact  
information. Commenters noted that digital communication could improve
interoperability by  
facilitating efficient exchange of patient records, eliminating the
burden of working with scanned  
paper documents, and ultimately enhancing care coordination.  
To ensure the index is accessible to all clinicians and facilities, we
have updated the  
NPPES[39](CMSs.html#136)to be able to capture digital contact
information for both individuals and facilities.  
NPPES currently supplies National Provider Identifier (NPI) numbers to
health care providers  
(both individuals and facilities), maintains their NPI record, and
publishes the records online.[40](CMSs.html#136)  
The Secretary adopted the NPI as the HIPAA administrative simplification
standard identifier for  
health care providers (69 FR 3434). HIPAA covered entities, including
health care providers,  
health plans, and health care clearinghouses, must use the NPI in HIPAA
transactions. All health  
care providers that transmit health information in electronic form in
connection with a HIPAA  
transaction must obtain an NPI.  
Health care providers are required to communicate to the NPPES any
information that  
has changed within 30 days of the change (45 CFR 162.410(a)(4)). CMS
reviews NPPES to  
  
39 The NPPES Web site is available a[t

**137**  
ensure a provider has a valid NPI as part of the Medicare enrollment
process, as well as the  
revalidation process, which occurs every 3 to 5 years depending on the
provider or supplier type.  
Information in NPPES is publicly accessible via both an online search
option and a  
downloadable database option. As a result, adding digital contact
information to this existing  
index is an efficient and effective way to meet the Congressional
requirement to establish a  
digital contact information index and to promote the sharing of
information.  
As of June 2018, NPPES has been updated to include the capability to
capture one or  
more pieces of digital contact information that can be used to
facilitate secure sharing of health  
information. For instance, providers can submit a Direct address, which
functions similar to a  
regular e-mail address, but includes additional security measures to
ensure that messages are  
only accessible to the intended recipient in order to keep the
information confidential and secure.  
“Direct” is a technical standard for exchanging health information.
Direct addresses are available  
from a variety of sources, including EHR vendors, State Health
Information Exchange entities,  
regional and local Health Information Exchange entities, as well as
private service providers  
offering Direct exchange capabilities called Health Information Service
Providers
(HISPs)  
[(https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/directbasicsforprovidersqa\_05092014.pdf)](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/directbasicsforprovidersqa_05092014.pdf).
NPPES  
can also capture information about a wide range of other types of
endpoints that providers can  
use to facilitate secure exchange of health information, for instance a
FHIR server URL or query  
endpoint associated with a health information exchange.  
In addition, NPPES can now maintain information about the type of
contact information  
providers and organizations are associated with, along with the
preferred uses for each address.  
Each provider in NPPES can maintain their own unique information or
associate themselves with  
information shared among a group of providers. Finally, NPPES has also
added a public API  
which can be used to obtain contact information stored in the database.
Although NPPES is now  

-----

<span id="138"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**138**  
better equipped to maintain provider digital contact information, many
providers have not  
submitted this information. In the 2015 final rule, “Medicare and
Medicaid Programs; Electronic  
Health Record Incentive Program-Stage 3 and Modifications to Meaningful
Use in 2015  
Through 2017” (80 FR 62901), we finalized a policy to collect
information in NPPES about the  
electronic addresses of participants in the EHR Incentive Program
(specifically, a Direct address  
and/or other “electronic service information” as available). However,
this policy was not fully  
implemented at the time, in part due to the limitations of the NPPES
system which have since  
been addressed. As a result, many providers have not yet added their
digital contact information  
to NPPES and digital contact information is frequently out of date.  
In light of these updates to the NPPES system, all individual health
care providers and  
facilities can take immediate action to update their NPPES record online
to add digital contact  
information. This simple step will significantly improve
interoperability by making valuable  
contact information easily accessible. For those providers who continue
to rely on the use of  
cumbersome, fax-based modes of sharing information, we hope that greater
availability of digital  
contact information will help to reduce barriers to electronic
communication with a wider set of  
providers with whom they share patients. Ubiquitous, public availability
of digital contact  
information for all providers is a crucial step towards eliminating the
use of fax machines for the  
exchange of health information. We urge all providers to take advantage
of this resource to  
implement Congress’ requirement that the Secretary establish a digital
contact information index.  
B. Proposed Public Reporting of Missing Digital Contact Information  
Entities seeking to engage in electronic health information exchange
need accurate  
information about the electronic addresses (for example, Direct address,
FHIR server URL,  
query endpoint, or other digital contact information) of potential
exchange partners. A common  
directory of the electronic addresses of health care providers and
organizations could enhance  

-----

<span id="139"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**139**  
interoperability and information exchange by providing a resource where
users can obtain  
information about how to securely transmit electronic health information
to a provider.  
We propose to increase the number of providers with valid and current
digital contact  
information available through NPPES by publicly reporting the names and
NPIs of those  
providers who do not have digital contact information included in the
NPPES system. We  
propose to begin this public reporting in the second half of 2020, to
allow individuals and  
facilities time to review their records in NPPES and update the system
with appropriate digital  
contact information. We are also requesting comment from stakeholders on
the most appropriate  
way to pursue this public reporting initiative, including where these
names should be posted,  
with what frequency, and any other information stakeholders believe
would be helpful.  
We believe this information is extremely valuable to facilitate
interoperability, and we  
appreciate Congress’ leadership in requiring the establishment of this
directory. We are  
interested in stakeholder comment on additional possible enforcement
authorities to ensure that  
individuals and facilities make their digital contact information
publicly available through  
NPPES. For example, should Medicare reporting programs, such as MIPS,
require eligible  
clinicians to update their NPPES data with their digital contact
information? Should CMS  
require this information to be included as part of the Medicare
enrollment and revalidation  
process? How can CMS work with states to promote adding information to
the directory through  
state Medicaid programs and CHIP? Should CMS require providers to submit
digital contact  
information as part of program integrity processes related to prior
authorization and submission  
of medical record documentation? We will review comments for possible
consideration in future  
rulemaking on these questions.

**X. Revisions to the Conditions of Participation for Hospitals and
Critical Access Hospitals**  
**(CAHs)**  
A. Background  
As noted earlier in this proposed rule, CMS appreciates the pathways
Congress has  
created for action on interoperability and has been working diligently
with ONC to implement  
them. In order to ensure broad stakeholder input to inform our
proposals, we published a Request  
for Information (RFI) on interoperability in several recently published
proposed rules, including  
the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule (83 FR 20550). Specifically, we published
the RFI entitled,  
“Promoting Interoperability and Electronic Healthcare Information
Exchange Through Possible  
Revisions to the CMS Patient Health and Safety Requirements for
Hospitals and Other  
Medicare- and Medicaid-Participating Providers and Suppliers.” We
requested stakeholders’  
input on how we could use the CMS health and safety standards that are
required for providers  
and suppliers participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs (that
is, the Conditions of  
Participation (CoPs), Conditions for Coverage (CfCs), and Requirements
for Participation (RfPs)  
for long term care facilities) to further advance electronic exchange of
information that supports  
safe, effective transitions of care between hospitals and community
providers. Specifically, we  
asked for comment on revisions to the current CMS CoPs for hospitals
such as: requiring that  
hospitals transferring medically necessary information to another
facility upon a patient transfer  
or discharge do so electronically; requiring that hospitals
electronically send required discharge  
information to a community provider via electronic means if possible and
if a community  
provider can be identified; and, requiring that hospitals make certain
information available to  
patients or a specified third-party application (for example, required
discharge instructions) via  
electronic means if requested.

<span id="141"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

**141**  
The RFI discussed several steps we have taken in recent years to update
and modernize  
the CoPs and other health and safety standards to reflect current best
practices for clinical care,  
especially in the area of care coordination and discharge planning. On
November 3, 2015, we  
published a proposed rule, “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Revisions to
Requirements for  
Discharge Planning for Hospitals, Critical Access Hospitals, and Home
Health Agencies” (80 FR  
68126), to implement the discharge planning requirements of the IMPACT
Act and to revise the  
discharge planning CoP requirements that hospitals (including short-term
acute care hospitals,  
LTCHs, rehabilitation hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, children's
hospitals, and cancer hospitals),  
CAHs, and HHAs must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and
Medicaid programs. The  
final rule in response to public comment on our proposed new
requirements for discharge  
planning for hospitals, CAHs, and HHAs is under development while we
review and respond to  
public comments (our deadline to finalize this rule is November 3,
2019). Several of the  
proposed requirements from the 2015 Discharge Planning proposed rule
directly addressed the  
issue of communication between providers and between providers and
patients, as well as the  
issue of interoperability:  
● Hospitals and CAHs would be required to transfer certain necessary
medical  
information and a copy of the discharge instructions and discharge
summary to the patient's  
practitioner, if the practitioner is known and has been clearly
identified;  
● Hospitals and CAHs would be required to send certain necessary medical
information  
to the receiving facility/PAC providers, at the time of discharge;
and,  
● Hospitals, CAHs, and HHAs would need to comply with the IMPACT Act  
requirements that would require hospitals, CAHs, and certain PAC
providers to use data on  
quality measures and data on resource use measures to assist patients
during the discharge  
planning process, while taking into account the patient's goals of care
and treatment preferences.

<span id="142"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

**142**  
We also published the “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Hospital and
Critical Access  
Hospital Changes to Promote Innovation, Flexibility and Improvement in
Patient Care” proposed  
rule (81 FR 39448) on June 16, 2016, which is under development while we
review and respond  
to public comments (our deadline to finalize this rule is June 15,
2019). In that rule, we proposed  
updating a number of CoP requirements that hospitals and CAHs would have
to meet to  
participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. One of the proposed
hospital CoP revisions  
directly addressed the issues of communication between providers and
patients, patient access to  
their medical records, and interoperability. We proposed that patients
have the right to access  
their medical records, including current medical records, upon an oral
or written request, in the  
form and format requested by such patients, if the information is
readily producible in such form  
and format (including in an electronic form or format when such medical
records are maintained  
electronically); or, if not, in a readable hard copy form or such other
form and format as agreed  
to by the facility and the individual, and within a reasonable
timeframe. Under the proposal, a  
hospital could not frustrate the legitimate efforts of individuals to
gain access to their own  
medical records and would be required to meet these patient requests as
quickly as record  
keeping systems permit.  
In response to the recent RFI in the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule, many
stakeholders  
supported our goals of increasing interoperability and acknowledged the
important role that  
hospital settings play in supporting care coordination. Stakeholders
agreed that use of electronic  
technology was an important factor in ensuring safe transitions. At the
same time, many  
stakeholders expressed concerns about implementing policy changes within
the CoPs, which  
may increase the compliance burden on hospitals.  
Given responses to the recent RFI, as well as previous rulemaking
activities, we are  
seeking to further expand CMS requirements for interoperability within
the hospital and CAH

CoPs as part of this proposed rulemaking by focusing on electronic
patient event notifications. In  
addition, we are committed to taking further steps to ensure that
facilities that are electronically  
capturing information are electronically exchanging that information
with providers who have  
the capacity to accept it. We expect that this will be required through
rulemaking at a future point  
in time, with one option being alignment with the TEFCA described in
section 4003 of the Cures  
Act. We will also continue to consider the RFI responses as we pursue
this goal in future  
rulemaking.  
Infrastructure supporting the exchange of electronic health information
across settings  
has matured substantially in recent years. Research studies have
increasingly found that health  
information exchange interventions can effect positive outcomes in
health care quality and public  
health, in addition to more longstanding findings around reductions in
utilization and costs. A  
recent review of how health information exchange interventions can
improve cost and quality  
outcomes identified a growing body of high-quality studies showing that
these interventions are  
associated with beneficial results.[41](CMSs.html#143) The authors
identified a number of studies demonstrating  
positive effects on outcomes associated with better care coordination,
such as reductions in 30-  
day
readmissions,[42](CMSs.html#143),[43](CMSs.html#143),[44](CMSs.html#143)and
medication reconciliation.[45](CMSs.html#143)

Electronic patient event notifications from hospitals, or clinical event
notifications, are  
one type of health information exchange intervention that has been
increasingly recognized as an  
effective and scalable tool for improving care coordination across
settings, especially for patients  
at discharge. This approach has been identified with a reduction in
readmissions following  
implementation.[46](CMSs.html#144)We note that the evidence cited in
this section to support the use of innovative  
health information exchange interventions and approaches, such as the
patient event notifications  
that we are proposing to require in this rule, can be applied to various
types of hospitals,  
including psychiatric hospitals, as well as to CAHs, as discussed
below.  
Patient event notifications are automated, electronic communications
from the  
discharging provider to another facility, or to another community
provider as identified by the  
patient, which alerts the receiving provider that the patient has
received care at a different  
setting. Depending on the implementation, information included with
these notifications can  
range from conveying the patient’s name, other basic demographic
information, and the sending  
institution to a richer set of clinical data on the patient. Regardless
of the information included,  
these notifications can help ensure that a receiving provider is aware
that the patient has received  
care elsewhere. The notification triggers a receiving provider to reach
out to the patient and  
deliver appropriate follow-up care in a timely manner. By notifying the
physician, care manager,  
or care management team, the notification can help to improve
post-discharge transitions and  
reduce the likelihood that a patient would face complications from
inadequate follow-up care.  
In addition to their effectiveness in supporting care coordination,
virtually all EHR  
systems generate the basic messages commonly used to support electronic
patient event  
notifications. These notifications are based on admission, discharge,
and transfer (ADT)

messages, a standard message used within an EHR as the vehicle for
communicating information  
about key changes in a patient’s status as they are tracked by the
system (more information about  
the current standard supporting these messages is available
at  
[http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product\_brief.cfm?product\_id=144)](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=144).
As noted in the ISA  
published by ONC, this messaging standard has been widely adopted across
the health care  
system (se[e
https://www.healthit.gov/isa/sending-a-notification-a-patients-admission-discharge-andor-](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/sending-a-notification-a-patients-admission-discharge-andor-transfer-status-other-providers)  
[transfer-status-other-providers).](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/sending-a-notification-a-patients-admission-discharge-andor-transfer-status-other-providers)  
ADT messages provide each patient’s personal or demographic information
(such as the  
patient’s name, insurance, next of kin, and attending physician), when
that information has been  
updated, and also indicate when an ADT status has changed. To create an
electronic patient  
event notification, a system can use the change in ADT status to trigger
a message to a receiving  
provider or to a health information exchange system that can then route
the message to the  
appropriate provider. In addition to the basic demographic information
contained in the ADT  
message, some patient event notification implementations attach more
detailed information to the  
message regarding the patient’s clinical status and care received from
the sending provider.  
B. Proposal for Hospitals (Proposed 42 CFR 482.24(d))  
We propose to revise the CoPs for Medicare- and Medicaid-participating
hospitals at 42  
CFR 482.24 by adding a new standard at paragraph (d), “Electronic
Notifications,” that would  
require hospitals to send electronic patient event notifications of a
patient’s admission, discharge,  
and/or transfer to another health care facility or to another community
provider. As noted in the  
discussion above, we would require hospitals to convey, at a minimum,
the patient’s basic  
personal or demographic information, as well as the name of the sending
institution (that is, the  
hospital), and, if not prohibited by other applicable law, diagnosis. We
would also encourage  
hospitals, as their systems and those of the receiving providers allow,
to work with patients and  

-----

<span id="146"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**146**  
their practitioners to offer more robust patient information and
clinical data upon request in  
accordance with applicable law.  
For a hospital that currently possesses an EHR system with the capacity
to generate the  
basic patient personal or demographic information for electronic patient
event (ADT)  
notifications, compliance with this proposed standard within the Medical
records services CoP  
(42 CFR 482.24) would be determined by the hospital demonstrating that
its system: (1) is fully  
operational and that it operates in accordance with all State and
Federal statutes and regulations  
regarding the exchange of patient health information; (2) utilizes the
content exchange standard  
incorporated by reference at 45 CFR 170.299(f)(2); (3) sends
notifications that must include the  
minimum patient health information (which must be patient name, treating
practitioner name,  
sending institution name, and, if not prohibited by other applicable
law, patient diagnosis); and  
(4) sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary that
facilitates exchange of health  
information, and at the time of the patient’s admission to the hospital
and either immediately  
prior to or at the time of the patient’s discharge and/or transfer from
the hospital. We recognize  
that some existing ADT messages might not include diagnosis and
therefore seek comment on  
the technical feasibility of including this information as well as the
challenges in appropriately  
segmenting this information in instances where the diagnosis may not be
permitted for disclosure  
under other applicable laws.  
We propose to limit this requirement to only those hospitals which
currently possess  
EHR systems with the technical capacity to generate information for
electronic patient event  
notifications as discussed below, recognizing that not all Medicare- and
Medicaid-participating  
hospitals have been eligible for past programs promoting adoption of EHR
systems. Our goal  
with this proposed requirement is to ensure that hospital EHR systems
have a basic capacity to  
generate messages that can be utilized for notifications by a wide range
of receiving providers,  

-----

<span id="147"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**147**  
enabled by common standards. We believe that a system that utilizes the
ADT messaging  
standard, which is widely used as the basis for implementing these
notifications and other similar  
use cases, would meet this goal by supporting the availability of
information that can be used to  
generate information for patient event notifications. Specifically, we
propose that the system  
utilize the ADT Messaging standard incorporated by reference at 45 CFR
170.299(f)(2).[47](CMSs.html#147)  
While there is no criterion under the ONC Health IT Certification
Program which  
certifies health IT to create and send electronic patient event
notifications, this standard is  
referenced by other certification criteria under the program.
Specifically, this standard supports  
certification criteria related to transferring information to
immunization registries, as well as  
transmission of laboratory results to public health agencies as
described at 45 CFR 170.315(f)  
under the 2015 Edition certification criteria, and at 45 CFR 170.314(f)
under the 2014 Edition.  
Thus, we expect systems that include Health IT Modules certified to meet
criteria which  
reference this standard will possess the basic capacity to generate
information for notification  
messages. We further note that adopting certified health IT that meets
these criteria has been  
required for any hospital seeking to qualify for the Promoting
Interoperability Programs  
(formerly the EHR Incentive Programs).  
We recognize that there is currently significant variation in how
hospitals have utilized  
the ADT messages to support implementation of patient event
notifications. We also recognize  
that many hospitals, which have already implemented notifications, may
be delivering additional  
information beyond the basic information included in the ADT message
(both automatically  
when a patient’s status changes and then upon request from receiving
providers) to receiving  
practitioners, patient care team members, and post-acute care services
providers and suppliers

with whom they have established patient care relationships and
agreements for patient health  
information exchange as allowed by law. We believe consensus standards
for ADT-based  
notifications may become more widely adopted in the future (we refer
readers to ONC’s ISA[48](CMSs.html#148)  
for more information about standards under consideration). However, at
this time, we do not  
wish to restrict hospitals from pursuing more advanced content as part
of patient notifications,  
nor to create redundant requirements where hospitals already have a
suitable notification system  
in place. Accordingly, while we are requiring that hospitals subject to
this proposal possess a  
system utilizing this standard, hospitals may utilize other standards or
features to support their  
notification systems. We request comment on this proposal, and whether
this requirement would  
achieve the goal of setting a baseline for hospitals’ capacity to
generate information for  
electronic notifications, while still allowing for innovative approaches
that would potentially  
increase the effectiveness of these notifications toward improving
patient outcomes and safety  
during transitions in care.  
We further propose that the hospital would need to demonstrate that the
system’s  
notification capacity is fully operational, that it operates in
accordance with all state and federal  
statutes and regulations regarding the exchange of patient health
information. We intend for  
these notifications to be required, at minimum, for inpatients admitted
to, and discharged and/or  
transferred from the hospital. However, we also note that patient event
notifications are an  
effective tool for coordinating care across a wider set of patients that
may be cared for by a  
hospital. For instance, a patient event notification could ensure a
primary care physician is aware  
that their patient has received care at the emergency room, and initiate
outreach to the patient to  
ensure that appropriate follow-up for the emergency visit is pursued.
While we encourage  
hospitals to extend the coverage of their notification systems to serve
additional patients,

**149**  
of those admitted and seen as inpatients, we also seek comment on
whether we should identify a  
broader set of patients to whom this requirement would apply, and if so,
how we should  
implement such a requirement in a way that minimizes administrative
burden on hospitals.  
Additionally, we are proposing that the hospital must demonstrate that
its system sends  
notifications that must include the minimum patient health information
(which must be patient  
name, treating practitioner name, sending institution name, and, if not
prohibited by other  
applicable law, patient diagnosis). The hospital would also need to
demonstrate that the system  
sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary that
facilitates exchange of health  
information, and at the time of the patient’s admission to the hospital,
to licensed and qualified  
practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services
providers and suppliers that:  
(1) receive the notification for treatment, care coordination, or
quality improvement purposes; (2)  
have an established care relationship with the patient relevant to his
or her care; and (3) for  
whom the hospital has a reasonable certainty of receipt of
notifications. Similarly, we are also  
proposing that the hospital would need to demonstrate the transmission
of these notifications  
either directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates the
exchange of health information, and  
either immediately prior to or at the time of the patient’s discharge or
transfer from the hospital,  
to licensed and qualified practitioners, other patient care team
members, and PAC services  
providers and suppliers that: (1) receive the notification for
treatment, care coordination, or  
quality improvement purposes; (2) have an established care relationship
with the patient relevant  
to his or her care; and (3) for whom the hospital has a reasonable
certainty of receipt of  
notifications. We believe this proposal will allow for a diverse set of
strategies that hospitals  
might use when implementing patient event notifications.  
Through these provisions, we are seeking to allow for different ways
that a hospital might  
identify those practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC
services providers and  

-----

<span id="150"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**150**  
suppliers that are most relevant to both the pre-admission and
post-discharge care of a patient.  
We are proposing that hospitals should send notifications to those
practitioners or providers that  
have an established care relationship with the patient relevant to his
or her care. We recognize  
that hospitals and their partners may identify appropriate recipients
through various methods. For  
instance, hospitals might identify appropriate practitioners by
requesting this information from  
patients or caregivers upon arrival, or by obtaining information about
care team members from  
the patient’s record. We expect hospitals might develop or optimize
processes to capture  
information about established care relationships directly, or work with
an intermediary that  
maintains information about care relationships. In other cases,
hospitals may, directly or through  
an intermediary, identify appropriate notification recipients through
the analysis of care patterns  
or other attribution methods that seek to determine the provider most
likely to be able to  
effectively coordinate care post-discharge for a specific patient. The
hospital or intermediary  
might also develop processes to allow a provider to specifically request
notifications for a given  
patient for whom they are responsible for care coordination as confirmed
through conversations  
with the patient.  
Additionally, we would expect hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs
to comply with  
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy
rules set out at 45 CFR  
Parts 160 and 164 when these proposed CoP requirements for patient event
notifications are  
finalized. As required at 42 CFR 482.11 for hospitals and psychiatric
hospitals and at 42 CFR  
485.608 for CAHs, these providers must comply with all pertinent
currently existing federal  
laws, including the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The patient event notifications
and other exchanges of  
patient information would be permitted as disclosures for treatment
purposes under 45 CFR part  
164\.  

-----

<span id="151"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**151**  
We also recognize that factors outside of the hospital’s control may
determine whether or  
not a notification is successfully received and utilized by a
practitioner. Accordingly, we have  
proposed that a hospital would only need to send notifications to those
practitioners for whom  
the hospital has reasonable certainty of receipt. While we expect
hospitals will, to the best of  
their ability, seek to ensure that notification recipients are able to
receive notifications (for  
instance, by obtaining a recipient’s Direct address), we understand that
technical issues beyond  
the hospital’s control may prevent successful receipt and use of a
notification.  
Finally, we note that hospitals have an existing responsibility under
the CoPs at 42 CFR  
482.43(d) to “transfer or refer patients, along with necessary medical
information, to appropriate  
facilities, agencies, or outpatient services, as needed, for follow-up
or ancillary care.” We wish to  
emphasize that our proposal regarding patient event notifications would
be separate from the  
requirement regarding necessary medical information at 42 CFR 482.43(d).
We recognize that  
processes to implement this proposal, if finalized, may intersect with
the hospital’s discharge  
planning process. We note that nothing in this proposal would affect the
hospital’s  
responsibilities under 42 CFR 482.43(d). However, if this proposal is
finalized, hospitals may  
wish to consider ways to fulfill these requirements in ways that reduce
redundancy while still  
remaining compliant with existing requirements. For instance, where
appropriate and allowed by  
law, hospitals may seek to include required necessary medical
information within the same  
message as a patient event notification.  
As previously stated, we are committed to continuing to identify further
steps we can take  
to ensure that facilities that are electronically capturing information
are exchanging that  
information electronically with providers that have the capacity to
accept it. We expect that this  
will be required through rulemaking at a future point in time with one
option being alignment  
with the TEFCA described in the Cures Act.

C. Proposal for Psychiatric Hospitals (Proposed 42 CFR 482.61(f))  
Medicare- and Medicaid-participating psychiatric hospitals must comply
with all of the  
hospital CoPs at 42 CFR 482.1 through 482.23 and at 42 CFR 482.25
through 482.57. They also  
must adhere to special provisions regarding medical records at 42 CFR
482.61 and staffing  
requirements at 42 CFR 482.62. Since the medical records requirements
are different for  
psychiatric hospitals, and since these hospitals do not have to comply
with our regulations at 42  
CFR 482.24, we are proposing a new electronic notification standard at
42 CFR 482.61(f) within  
the special provisions for psychiatric hospitals in this section.  
Similar to our proposal for hospitals at 42 CFR 482.24(d), we are
proposing a new  
standard at 42 CFR 482.61(f), “Electronic Notifications,” that would
require psychiatric hospitals  
to send electronic patient event notifications of a patient’s admission,
discharge, and/or transfer  
to another health care facility or to another community provider.  
As we have proposed for hospitals, we propose to limit this requirement
to only those  
psychiatric hospitals which currently possess EHR systems with the
technical capacity to  
generate information for electronic patient event notifications, defined
as systems that utilize the  
content exchange standard incorporated by reference at 45 CFR
170.299(f)(2). We propose that  
that for a psychiatric hospital that currently possesses an EHR system
with the capacity to  
generate the basic patient personal or demographic information for
electronic patient event  
(ADT) notifications, compliance with this proposed standard within the
Special medical records  
requirements for psychiatric hospitals CoP (42 CFR 482.61) would be
determined by the hospital  
demonstrating that its system: (1) is fully operational and that it
operates in accordance with all  
State and Federal statutes and regulations regarding the exchange of
patient health information;  
(2) utilizes the content exchange standard incorporated by reference at
45 CFR 170.299(f)(2); (3)  
sends notifications that must include the minimum patient health
information (which must be  

-----

<span id="153"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**153**  
patient name, treating practitioner name, sending institution name, and,
if not prohibited by other  
applicable law, patient diagnosis) ; and (4) sends notifications
directly, or through an  
intermediary that facilitates exchange of health information, and at the
time of the patient’s  
admission to the hospital and either immediately prior to or at the time
of the patient’s discharge  
and/or transfer from the hospital. Please note that we are requesting
comment on this policy as  
part of this hospital proposal in section X.B. of this proposed rule
above. Please see additional  
discussion in the proposal for hospitals above.  
Additionally, we are proposing that the hospital would need to
demonstrate that the system  
sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary that
facilitates exchange of health  
information, and at the time of the patient’s admission to the hospital,
to licensed and qualified  
practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services
providers and suppliers that:  
(1) receive the notification for treatment, care coordination, or
quality improvement purposes; (2)  
have an established care relationship with the patient relevant to his
or her care; and (3) for  
whom the hospital has a reasonable certainty of receipt of
notifications. Similarly, we are also  
proposing that the hospital would need to demonstrate the transmission
of these notifications  
either directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates the
exchange of health information, and  
either immediately prior to or at the time of the patient’s discharge or
transfer from the hospital,  
to licensed and qualified practitioners, other patient care team
members, and PAC services  
providers and suppliers that: (1) receive the notification for
treatment, care coordination, or  
quality improvement purposes; (2) have an established care relationship
with the patient relevant  
to his or her care; and (3) for whom the hospital has a reasonable
certainty of receipt of  
notifications.  
We refer readers to the extended discussion of these proposals in
sections X.A. and B. of  
this proposed rule. We seek comment on these proposals.

**154**  
D. Proposal for CAHs  
We believe implementation of patient event notifications are also
important for CAHs to  
support improved care coordination from these facilities to other
providers in their communities.  
Therefore, similar to our proposals for the hospital and psychiatric
hospital medical records  
requirements as discussed in the preceding sections, we would revise 42
CFR 485.638, by adding  
a new standard to the CAH Clinical records CoP at paragraph (d),
“Electronic Notifications.”  
This proposed standard would require CAHs to send electronic patient
event notifications of a  
patient’s admission, discharge, and/or transfer to another health care
facility or to another  
community provider.  
We propose to limit this requirement to only those CAHs which currently
possess EHR  
systems with the technical capacity to generate information for
electronic patient event  
notifications, defined as systems that utilize the content exchange
standard incorporated by  
reference at 45 CFR 170.299(f)(2). We propose that for a CAH that
currently possesses an EHR  
system with the capacity to generate the basic patient personal or
demographic information for  
electronic patient event (ADT) notifications, compliance with this
proposed standard within the  
Clinical records services CoP (42 CFR 485.638) would be determined by
the CAH  
demonstrating that its system: (1) is fully operational and that it
operates in accordance with all  
State and Federal statutes and regulations regarding the exchange of
patient health information;  
(2) utilizes the content exchange standard incorporated by reference at
45 CFR 170.299(f)(2); (3)  
sends notifications that must include the minimum patient health
information (which must be  
patient name, treating practitioner name, sending institution name, and,
if not prohibited by other  
applicable law, patient diagnosis); and (4) sends notifications
directly, or through an  
intermediary that facilitates exchange of health information, and at the
time of the patient’s  
admission to the CAH and either immediately prior to or at the time of
the patient’s discharge

and/or transfer from the CAH. Please note that we are requesting comment
on this policy as part  
of the hospital proposal above in section X.B. of this proposed rule.
Please see additional  
discussion in the proposal for hospitals above.  
Additionally, we are proposing that the CAH would need to demonstrate
that the system  
sends notifications directly, or through an intermediary that
facilitates exchange of health  
information, and at the time of the patient’s admission to the CAH, to
licensed and qualified  
practitioners, other patient care team members, and PAC services
providers and suppliers that:  
(1) receive the notification for treatment, care coordination, or
quality improvement purposes; (2)  
have an established care relationship with the patient relevant to his
or her care; and (3) for  
whom the CAH has a reasonable certainty of receipt of notifications.
Similarly, we are also  
proposing that the CAH would need to demonstrate the transmission of
these notifications either  
directly, or through an intermediary that facilitates the exchange of
health information, and either  
immediately prior to or at the time of the patient’s discharge or
transfer from the CAH, to  
licensed and qualified practitioners, other patient care team members,
and PAC services  
providers and suppliers that: (1) receive the notification for
treatment, care coordination, or  
quality improvement purposes; (2) have an established care relationship
with the patient relevant  
to his or her care; and (3) for whom the CAH has a reasonable certainty
of receipt of  
notifications.  
We request comments on all of these proposals. We are especially
interested in  
stakeholder feedback about how these proposals should be
operationalized. Additionally, we  
seek comment on how CMS should implement these proposals as part of
survey and certification  
guidance in a manner that minimizes compliance burden on hospitals,
psychiatric hospitals, and  
CAHs while ensuring adherence with the standards. We are also interested
in stakeholder input

about a reasonable timeframe for implementation of these proposals for
hospitals, psychiatric  
hospitals, and CAHs, respectively.  
**XI. Request for Information on Advancing Interoperability Across the
Care Continuum**  
A. Background  
Transitions across care settings have been characterized as common,
complicated, costly,  
and potentially hazardous for individuals with complex health needs. Yet
despite the need for  
functionality to support better care coordination, discharge planning,
and timely transfer of  
essential health information, interoperability by certain health care
providers such as long term  
and PAC, behavioral health, and home and community-based services
continues to lag behind  
acute care providers. Research from the Assistant Secretary for Planning
and Evaluation (ASPE)  
and CMS, showed that in 2014, 44 percent of patients discharged from an
acute care  
hospitalization received post-acute services, such as an admission to a
SNFs, an IRF or a LTCH,  
or received HHA services. Specifically, of the 1,260,958 patients that
received post-acute  
services following an acute care hospitalization, “…47.8 percent were
discharged to a HHA,  
42.1 percent to a SNF, 8.4 percent to an IRF, 1.0 percent to a LTCH and
.7 percent to LTCH-Site  
Neutral.”[49](CMSs.html#156)In addition to the frequency of patients
discharged from acute care to PAC, a  
remarkable number of patients discharged from PAC services receive
subsequent care by another  
PAC provider. For instance, while more current analysis is being
finalized, we note that 2012  
data from the Post-Acute Care Reform Demonstration (PAC PRD) found, “67
percent of those  
discharged to SNFs continued on to additional services. Almost a quarter
of them were  
readmitted to the acute hospital (23.1 percent). Another third (32.7
percent) were discharged  
from the SNF to a HHA.  
  
49 Ongoing work under contract: HHSP23320095651WC with RTI
International.

<span id="157"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**157**  
In patients with the Acute-SNF-HHA pattern, almost 20 percent (19.9
percent) returned  
to the acute care hospital within 30 days of discharge from the HHA.
Hospital patients  
discharged to LTCHs and IRFs were also likely to use multiple types of
PAC services and a  
substantial share of these cases were readmitted within 30 days of
discharge, ranging from 15.9  
percent (LTCH-to-IRF cases) to 42.8 percent (LTCH to SNF
cases).”[50](CMSs.html#157) In examining the home  
health patterns, it is important to keep in mind that a significant
number of the home health  
population does not come through an acute admission or as part of a
post-acute trajectory of care  
but instead are directly admitted to the HHA from the community. The
percentages of PAC use  
and patterns of multiple transitions reinforce the need for safeguards
around transitions of care.  
These findings also speak to the importance of the interoperable
exchange of information  
necessary to ensure continuity of care, and mitigate the risks of
unintended events, such as those  
associated with medication errors, that can result from inadequate and
untimely exchange of  
information.  
Poor patient outcomes, resulting from poor communication and lack of
information, have  
been found to contribute to hospital readmissions, emergency department
(ED) visits, and  
adverse outcomes. A well-documented contributor to this problem is
incomplete and missing  
information for patients with frequent transitions across care settings.
While interoperable,  
bidirectional exchange of essential health information can improve these
transitions, many long-  
term and PAC, behavioral health, and home and community-based service
providers have not  
adopted health IT at the same rate as acute care hospitals. One major
contributing factor to this  
difference in adoption rates can be attributed to the fact that PAC
providers were not eligible for

the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs (now known as the
Promoting  
Interoperability Programs), which slowed adoption of EHRs and other
forms of interoperable  
health IT for these providers.  
National data on EHR adoption and interoperability by these providers is
limited. For  
PAC facilities that do possess EHRs, vendor adoption of interoperable
functionality has been  
slow and uneven. A national survey of SNFs found that 64 percent of
facilities used an EHR in  
2016, 29 percent of SNFs could send or receive health information, but
only 7 percent could  
send, find, receive, and integrate such
information.[51](CMSs.html#158)According to the 2015 National
Electronic  
Health Records Survey (NEHRS), 61.3 percent of psychiatrists were using
an EHR, of which  
40.8 percent were certified systems.[52](CMSs.html#158)A CDC survey
found that 26 percent of residential care  
communities used EHRs in 2016.[53](CMSs.html#158)  
B. Solicitation of Comments  
We are soliciting comment on several potential strategies for advancing
interoperability  
across care settings to inform future rulemaking activity in this
area.  
As discussed above, health IT adoption has lagged in care settings that
were not part of  
the EHR Incentive Programs. We are seeking input on how HHS can more
broadly incentivize  
the adoption of interoperable health IT systems and use of interoperable
data across settings such  
as long-term and PAC, behavioral health, and those settings serving
individuals who are dually  
eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and/or receiving home and
community-based services. We

invite comment on specific policy strategies HHS could adopt to deliver
financial support for  
technology adoption and use in these settings.  
We also recognize that an ongoing challenge to advancing and
incentivizing  
interoperability is the lack of agreed-upon measure concepts with which
to gauge how well  
providers are routinely and effectively engaging in exchange of
information across settings. To  
date, the measurement of interoperability has largely focused on the use
of certified technology  
and the percentage of information exchanged. Expanding the scope of
interoperability  
measurement beyond settings that were eligible for the EHR Incentive
Programs is critical as  
efforts are being made to enable health IT and exchange capabilities
across a broader range of  
care settings. In light of the interest by the stakeholder community to
enable interoperability  
across all providers, HHS is seeking public comment on measure concepts
that assess  
interoperability, including measure concepts that address PAC,
behavioral health, home and  
community-based services, and other provider settings.  
A National Quality Forum report on *Quality in Home and Community-Based
Services to*  
*Support Community Living: Addressing Gaps in Performance Measurement*
suggested that new  
types of measure concepts that assess quality across the continuum of
care are needed.  
Specifically, NQF cited the domain of “service delivery and
effectiveness,” which encompasses  
the level to which individuals who use Home and Community Based Services
(HCBS) receive  
services and supports sufficient to meet their needs, as well as the
domain of “person-centered  
planning and coordination,” which includes a focus on the level to which
services and supports  
across the health and social service systems are coordinated for
individuals who receive HCBS.  
We seek comment on needed measure development work and quality
improvement efforts  
focused on assuring individuals receive sufficient needed services
across the care continuum and

that their services are coordinated.[54](CMSs.html#160) We are also
interested in comments on the applicability and  
feasibility of measure concepts for PAC, behavioral health, home and
community-based services  
as identified in previous ASPE reports[55,56](CMSs.html#160) and the
report, *A Measurement Framework to Assess*  
*Nationwide Progress Related to Interoperable Health Information
Exchange to Support the*  
*National Quality Strategy,* published by the National Quality
Forum.[57](CMSs.html#160)  
As part of its work under the IMPACT Act, which requires, in part, that
certain patient  
assessment data be standardized and interoperable to allow for exchange
of the data among PAC  
providers and other providers, CMS has defined certain standardized
patient assessment data  
elements[58](CMSs.html#160) and their associated health IT vocabularies
across PAC settings. Implementation of  
these standardized data elements is designed to support more seamless
and effective assessment  
of quality across PAC settings, while also presenting a significant
improvement in the ability of  
these settings to potentially share structured electronic data with
other providers across the care  
continuum.

To enable the bidirectional exchange of this health information, we are
seeking public  
comment on whether hospitals and physicians should adopt the capability
to collect and  
electronically exchange a subset of the same PAC standardized patient
assessment data elements  
(for example, functional status, pressure ulcers/injuries) in their
EHRs. As these health care  
providers have generally been eligible for the EHR Incentive Programs
(now known as  
Promoting Interoperability Programs), many of them would have adopted
certified EHR  
technology and health IT systems, which are required to capture and
exchange certain data  
elements under the ONC Health IT certification program. The set of data
which systems must  
include under the certification program is set to expand in coming years
under the USCDI  
Version 1 ONC has proposed for HHS adoption at 45 CFR 170.213, which
would establish a  
minimum set of data classes that would be required to be interoperable
nationwide. (See the  
ONC proposed rule published elsewhere in this **Federal Register**) The
USCDI is designed to be  
expanded in an iterative and predictable way over time.  
We are seeking comment on whether to move toward the adoption of PAC
standardized  
data elements through the expansion of the USCDI process. We are
interested in whether the  
standardized patient assessment data elements that are implemented in
CMS PAC assessment  
instruments in satisfaction of the IMPACT Act would be appropriate. If
the full set of such  
standardized patient assessment data elements is not appropriate, we are
seeking comment on  
whether a subset of these standardized items would be appropriate, and
input on which data  
elements should be prioritized as part of a subset. We are also seeking
information on what  
implementation timeline would be most appropriate for requiring adoption
of these data elements  
in provider and hospital systems under the ONC Health IT Certification
Program. We are also  
seeking comment on the administrative, development, and implementation
burden that may be  
associated with adopting these data elements.

**XII. Advancing Interoperability in Innovative Models**  
A. Promoting Interoperability  
CMS plans to utilize Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation
("Innovation Center")  
authority under section 1115A of the Act to test ways to promote
interoperability across the  
health care spectrum. Section 1115A of the Act authorizes the Innovation
Center to test  
innovative payment and service delivery models expected to reduce
program expenditures, while  
preserving or enhancing the quality of care furnished to Medicare and
Medicaid beneficiaries  
and CHIP enrollees. Interoperability and health data sharing are
critical to the success of new  
payment and service delivery models that incentivize high quality,
efficient care.  
Innovation Center models can include multiple types of health care
providers and other  
entities such as physician group practices, hospitals, PAC facilities,
community-based  
organizations providing community-based long-term care services and
supports or non-medical  
services, and dialysis centers. These types of health care providers
furnish care to patients in  
different care settings, have different health IT systems, and have
varied levels of experience  
with, and access to, EHR technology. The historically disparate and
inadequate use of health IT  
among these providers and other entities has posed challenges to
interoperability. Additionally,  
many of these types of health care providers are not eligible for the
Promoting Interoperability  
Programs (previously known as the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive
Programs) and the  
associated financial incentives for EHR adoption and meaningful use.  
We believe Innovation Center models
[(https://innovation.cms.gov/)](https://innovation.cms.gov/) provide an
important  
lever to advance progress toward interoperability. These models offer
unique opportunities to  
engage with health care providers and other entities in innovative ways
and to test concepts that  
have the ability to accelerate change in the U.S. health care system,
including to promote  
interoperability. One example of CMS’s use of Innovation Center Models
to promote  

-----

<span id="163"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**163**  
interoperability is found in the Innovation Center’s State Innovation
Models (SIM)
initiative  
[(https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/state-innovations/)](https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/state-innovations/),
under which several awards to states  
are focused on health information exchanges and health IT investment.
Another example of this  
work is found in the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+)
model  
[(https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/comprehensive-primary-care-plus)](https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/comprehensive-primary-care-plus),
in which primary care  
practices use health IT to strengthen their ability to deliver care,
with some practices partnering  
with health IT vendors to implement advanced health IT functionality in
their practices,  
including functionality that promotes interoperability and sharing of
electronic health  
information.  
B. Examples of Interoperability-Related Areas of Focus for New Model
Development  
Examples of how we may focus on interoperability related-issues in
future model  
development may include: models that incorporate piloting emerging
standards; models  
leveraging non-traditional data in model design (for example, data from
schools, data regarding  
housing and data on food insecurity); and models leveraging
technology-enabled patient  
engagement platforms. The Innovation Center has incorporated
non-clinical data in prior models,  
but anticipates addressing additional uses and types of non-clinical
data in future models.  
We are now requesting public comment on the following general principles
around  
interoperability within Innovation Center models for integration into
new models, through  
provisions in model participation agreements or other governing
documents. In applying these  
general principles, we intend to be sensitive to the details of
individual model design, and the  
characteristics and capacities of the participants in each specific
model.  
C. Establishing Principles for Promoting Interoperability in Innovative
Model Tests  
1\. Provide Patients Access to their Own Electronic Health Information  

-----

<span id="164"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**164**  
The MyHealthEData and Medicare Blue Button 2.0 initiatives aim to
empower patients  
by ensuring that they have access to their health care data and can
decide how their data is going  
to be used, all while keeping their data safe and secure. Certain
Innovation Center models  
already require that participants with direct patient interactions
provide their patients with  
electronic access to their health information within 24 hours of any
encounter. New Innovation  
Center models may also require that providers and other health care
entities with direct patient  
interactions provide patients access to their own electronic health
information and, upon the  
patient’s authorization, to third party developers via APIs.  
2\. Promote Trusted Health Information Exchange  
Innovation Center model participants may, where appropriate, be required
to participate  
in a trusted exchange network that meets the following criteria:  
● The trusted exchange network must be able to exchange PHI in
compliance with all  
applicable state and federal laws across jurisdictions.  
● The trusted exchange network must connect both inpatient EHRs and
ambulatory  
EHRs.  
● The trusted exchange network must support secure messaging or
electronic querying  
by and between patients, providers and payers.  
Additionally, model participants may be required to participate in
electronic alerting via  
one of the standards described in the ISA, II-A: Admission, Discharge,
and Transfer published  
and updated by ONC.  
3\. Adopt Leading Health IT Standards and Pilot Emerging Standards  
Emerging health data standards present new opportunities to exchange
more types of  
health care data between health care providers. Innovation Center model
participants, along with  
their health IT vendors, may pilot new FHIR standards and advance
adoption of new data classes  

-----

<span id="165"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**165**  
in USCDI (for example, psychosocial data) to improve interoperability
for care management,  
quality reporting or other priority use cases. As part of the design and
testing of innovative  
payment and service delivery models, the Innovation Center anticipates
taking on a leadership  
role in developing new or less mature FHIR and supporting more
innovative interventions  
undertaken by states, whenever possible.  
D. Request for Stakeholder Input  
  
The Innovation Center seeks public comment on the principles for
promoting  
interoperability in innovative payment and service delivery models
described above.  
Additionally, the Innovation Center is requesting public comment on
other ways in which the  
Innovation Center may further promote interoperability among model
participants and other  
health care providers as part of the design and testing of innovative
payment and service delivery  
models.  
**XIII. Request for Information on Policies to Improve Patient
Matching**  
A. Background  
Through stakeholder feedback such as roundtables, stakeholder meetings,
and  
rulemaking, we have received considerable feedback that the lack of a
UPI inhibits  
interoperability efforts because, without a unique identifier for each
patient, the safe and secure  
electronic exchange of health information is constrained as it is
difficult to ensure that the  
relevant records are all for the same patient. HIPAA required the
adoption of a “unique  
individual identifier for healthcare purposes,” commonly referred to as
a UPI. At the time  
HIPAA was enacted, HHS began to consider what information would be
needed to develop a  
rule to adopt a UPI standard. An initial Notice of Intent to issue a
proposed rule on requirements  
for a unique health identifier for individuals was published in the
November 2, 1998 **Federal**  
**Register** (63 FR 61773 through 61774).  

-----

<span id="166"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**166**  
Appreciating the significant privacy and security concerns raised by
stakeholders  
regarding implementing a UPI, Congress included language in the Omnibus
Consolidated and  
Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277,
enacted October 21,  
1998\) and in each subsequent Appropriations bill, stating none of the
funds made available in  
this Act may be used to promulgate or adopt any final standard under
section 1173(b) of the Act  
(42 U.S.C. 1320d–2(b)) providing for, or providing for the assignment
of, a unique health  
identifier for an individual (except in an individual’s capacity as an
employer or a health care  
provider), until legislation is enacted specifically approving the
standard. This language has  
effectively prohibited HHS from engaging in rulemaking to adopt a UPI
standard. Consequently,  
the Secretary withdrew the Notice of Intent to pursue rulemaking on this
issue on August 9,
2000  
[(https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=200010\&RIN=0938-AI91).](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=200010&RIN=0938-AI91)  
Although the appropriations language regarding the UPI standard has
remained  
unchanged, in the report accompanying the 2017 appropriations bill,
Congress additionally  
stated, although the Committee continues to carry a prohibition against
HHS using funds to  
promulgate or adopt any final standard providing for the assignment of a
unique health identifier  
for an individual until such activity is authorized, the Committee notes
that this limitation does  
not prohibit HHS from examining the issues around patient matching.
Accordingly, the  
Committee encouraged the Secretary, acting through ONC and CMS, to
provide technical  
assistance to private-sector led initiatives to develop a coordinated
national strategy that will  
promote patient safety by accurately identifying patients to their
health information. (H.R. Rep.

Congress has repeated this guidance for 2018 and 2019. This guidance
directed  
HHS to focus on examining issues around patient matching and to provide
technical assistance to  
private sector-led initiatives focusing on a patient matching
solution.

In conjunction with ONC, we are posing a request for information
regarding how CMS  
could leverage our program authority to improve patient identification
to facilitate improved  
patient safety, enable better care coordination, and advance
interoperability. Inaccurate patient  
matching can lead to adverse events, compromised safety and privacy,
inappropriate and  
unnecessary care, increased health care costs, and poor oversight of
fraud and abuse. We  
consider this a quality of care and patient safety issue and seek
stakeholder input on ways we can  
incent improvements.  
In section 4007 of the 21st Century Cures Act, the Government
Accountability Office  
(GAO) was directed to conduct a study to determine whether ONC and other
stakeholders could  
improve patient matching through various mechanisms, to survey ongoing
efforts related to the  
policies and activities and the effectiveness of such efforts occurring
in the private sector, and to  
evaluate current methods used in certified EHRs for patient matching.
The GAO was also tasked  
with submitting to Congress a report concerning the findings of the
study. This report was  
released in January 2019.[59](CMSs.html#167)  
In section I of this proposed rule, we discuss further how patient
identification and  
matching pose challenges to interoperability. We look forward to working
with ONC as we  
review the responses to this RFI in concert with the GAO report to help
inform potential  
appropriate methods to scale best practices and leverage program
authority to improve patient  
matching.  
B. Solicitation of Comments  
We are soliciting comment on potential strategies to address patient
matching. Many  
stakeholders commenting on the interoperability RFIs included in the
various 2019 proposed  
payment rules, including the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule (83 FR 20550),
indicated that

matching is a “core functionality” of patient identification and
necessary to ensure care  
coordination and the best patient outcomes. Commenters also noted that a
consistently used  
matching strategy could accomplish the original goals of a UPI with a
diminished risk to  
individual privacy and health information security. We solicit comment
on how and in what way  
patient matching does or does not present the same security and privacy
risks as a UPI.  
We understand the significant health information privacy and security
concerns raised  
around the development of a UPI standard and the current prohibition
against using HHS funds  
to adopt a UPI standard. Recognizing Congress’ statement regarding
patient matching and  
stakeholder comments stating that a patient matching solution would
accomplish the goals of a  
UPI, we seek comment on ways for us to continue to facilitate private
sector work on a workable  
and scalable patient matching strategy so that the lack of a specific
UPI does not impede the free  
flow of information for future consideration.  
We are also seeking comment on how we may leverage our program authority
to provide  
support to those working to improve patient matching. We specifically
seek input on the  
following questions and the potential authority for the requirement:  
1\. Should CMS require Medicare FFS, MA Plans, Medicaid FFS, Medicaid
managed  
care plans (MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs), CHIP FFS, CHIP managed care
entities, and QHP  
issuers in FFEs (not including SADP issuers), use a patient matching
algorithm with a proven  
success rate of a certain percentage where the algorithm and real world
processes associated with  
the algorithm used are validated by HHS or a 3rd party?  
2\. Should CMS require Medicare FFS, the MA Plans, Medicaid FFS,
Medicaid managed  
care plans, CHIP FFS, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers in
FFEs to use a particular  
patient matching software solution with a proven success rate of a
certain percentage validated  
by HHS or a 3rd party?  

-----

<span id="169"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**169**  
3\. Should CMS expand the recent Medicare ID card efforts by requiring a
CMS-wide  
identifier which is used for all beneficiaries and enrollees in health
care programs under CMS  
administration and authority, specifically by requiring any or all of
the following:  
● That MA organizations, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors,
entities offering cost  
plans under section 1876 of the Act, and other Medicare health plans use
the Medicare ID in  
their plan administration.  
● That State Medicaid and CHIP agencies in their FFS or managed care
programs use  
the Medicare ID for dual eligible individuals when feasible.  
● That QHP issuers in FFEs use the Medicare ID for their enrollees in
the administration  
of their plans.  
4\. Should CMS advance more standardized data elements across all
appropriate  
programs for matching purposes, perhaps leveraging the USCDI proposed by
ONC for HHS  
adoption at 45 CFR 170.213.  
5\. Should CMS complement CMS data and plan data in Medicaid managed
care plans  
(MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs), CHIP managed care entities, MA Plans, and QHP
issuers in an  
FFE (not including SADP issuers) with one or more verifying data sources
for identity proofing?  
What potential data source should be considered? What are possible
restrictions or limitations to  
accessing such information?  
6\. Should CMS support connecting EHRs to other complementary verifying
data sources  
for identity proofing? What potential data source should be considered?
What are possible  
restrictions or limitations to accessing such information?  
7\. To what extent should patient-generated data complement the
patient-matching  
efforts?

**XIV. Collection of Information Requirements**  
  
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, we are required to provide
60-day notice in  
the **Federal Register** and solicit public comment before a collection
of information requirement  
is submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and
approval. In order  
to fairly evaluate whether an information collection should be approved
by OMB, section  
3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires that we
solicit comment on the  
following issues:  
● The need for the information collection and its usefulness in carrying
out the proper  
functions of our agency.  
● The accuracy of our estimate of the information collection burden.  
● The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be
collected.  
● Recommendations to minimize the information collection burden on the
affected  
public, including automated collection techniques.  
We are soliciting public comment on each of these issues for the
following sections of  
this document that contain information collection requirements (ICRs):  
A. Background  
Health plans should have the ability to exchange data instantly with
other payers for care  
and payment coordination or transitions, and with providers to
facilitate more efficient care.  
Health plans are in a unique position to provide enrollees a complete
picture of their claims and  
encounter data, allowing patients to piece together their own
information that might otherwise be  
lost in disparate systems. To advance our commitment to
interoperability, we are proposing new  
requirements to implement APIs for MA organizations at 42 CFR 422.119,
Medicaid FFS at 42  
CFR 431.60, CHIP FFS at 42 CFR 457.730, Medicaid managed care at 42 CFR
438.242, CHIP  
managed care at 42 CFR 457.1233(d), and QHP issuers in FFEs, excluding
SADPs at 45 CFR  

-----

<span id="171"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**171**  
156.221. These openly published APIs will permit third-party
applications to retrieve  
standardized data for adjudicated claims, encounters with capitated and
subcapitated providers,  
provider remittances, beneficiary cost-sharing, reports of lab test
results (depending on whether  
the plan manages such data), provider directories, and, as applicable,
preferred drug lists. We  
believe that these proposals are designed to empower patients by making
sure that they can  
access their healthcare data, through the use of common technologies,
without special effort and  
in an easily usable digital format. We also expect our API proposals to
enable the enrollees in  
the plans that are subject to our proposal to share their healthcare
data. By making claims data  
readily available and portable to the patient, these initiatives support
moving our healthcare  
system away from a FFS payment system that pays for volume and toward a
payment system  
that pays for value and quality by reducing duplication of services;
adding efficiency to provider  
visits; and, facilitating identification of fraud, waste, and abuse.  
B. Wage Estimates  
To derive average costs, we used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics’ May  
2017 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates for Direct
Health and Medical  
Insurance Carriers (NAICS
524114)[(https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics5\_524114.htm).](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics5_524114.htm)  
Table 1 presents the mean hourly wage, the cost of fringe benefits
(calculated at 100 percent of  
salary), and the adjusted hourly wage.

As indicated, we are adjusting our employee hourly wage estimates by a
factor of 100  
percent. This is necessarily a rough adjustment, both because fringe
benefits and overhead costs  
vary significantly from employer to employer, and because methods of
estimating these costs  
vary widely from study to study. Nonetheless, there is no practical
alternative and we believe  
that doubling the hourly wage to estimate total cost is a reasonable
accurate estimation method.  
C. Information Collection Requirements (ICRs)  
1\. ICRs Regarding MMA File Requirements (42 CFR 423.910)  
States submit data on files at least monthly to CMS to identify all
dually eligible  
individuals, including full-benefit and partial-benefit dually eligible
beneficiaries (that is, those  
who get Medicaid help with Medicare premiums, and often for
cost-sharing). The file is called  
the MMA file, but is occasionally referred to as the “State Phasedown
file.” Section 423.910(d)  
requires states to submit at least one MMA file each month. However,
states have the option to  
submit multiple MMA files throughout the month (up to one per day). Most
states submit at least  
weekly. This information collection activity is currently approved under
OMB control number  
0938-0958.  
Ensuring information on dual eligibility status is accurate and
up-to-date by increasing

<span id="173"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****

****  
**173**  
the frequency of federal-state data exchange is an important step toward
interoperability. As a  
result, we are proposing to update the frequency requirements in 42 CFR
423.910(d) to require  
that starting April 1, 2022, all states submit the required MMA file
data to CMS daily, and to  
make conforming edits to 42 CFR 423.910(b)(1). Daily would mean every
business day, but that  
if no new transactions are available to transmit, data would not need to
be submitted on a given  
business day. We estimate it would take a computer systems analyst about
6 months  
(approximately 960 hours) to complete the systems updates necessary to
process and submit the  
MMA data daily. As only 13 states currently submit MMA data daily, we
estimate a one-time  
burden for 37 states and the District of Columbia complying with
submission of daily MMA data  
at $3,034,406 (38 states (and DC) x 960 hours x $83.18 per hour for a
computer system analyst).  
We will be revising the information collection request currently
approved under 0938-0958 to  
include the requirements discussed in this section.  
2\. ICRs Regarding API Proposals (42 CFR 422.119, 431.60, and 438.242,
and 45 CFR 156.221)  
To promote our commitment to interoperability, we are proposing new
requirements for  
APIs for MA organizations at 42 CFR 422.119, Medicaid FFS at 42 CFR
431.60, CHIP FFS at  
42 CFR 457.730, Medicaid managed care at 42 CFR 438.242, CHIP managed
care at 42 CFR  
457.1233(d), and QHP issuers in FFEs at 45 CFR 156.221. These openly
published APIs will  
permit third-party applications to retrieve standardized data for
adjudicated claims, encounters  
with capitated and subcapitated providers, provider remittances,
beneficiary cost-sharing, reports  
of lab test results, provider directories, and preferred drug lists. To
implement the new  
requirements for APIs, we estimate that plans and states will conduct
three major work phases:  
initial design; development and testing; and long-term support and
maintenance.  
In the initial design phase, we believe tasks would include: determining
available  
resources (personnel, hardware, cloud space, etc.); assessing whether to
use in-house resources to  

-----

<span id="174"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**174**  
facilitate an API connection or contract the work to a third party;
convening a team to scope,  
build, test, and maintain the API; performing a data availability scan
to determine any gaps  
between internal data models and the data required for the necessary
FHIR resources; and,  
mitigating any gaps discovered in the available data.  
During the development and testing phase, we believe plans and states
would need to  
conduct the following: map existing data to FHIR, which would constitute
the bulk of the work  
required for implementation; allocate hardware for the necessary
environments (development,  
testing, production); build a new FHIR server or leverage existing FHIR
servers; determine the  
frequency and method by which internal data is populated on the FHIR
server; build connections  
between the databases and FHIR server; perform capability and security
testing; and vetting  
third-party applications.  
After the completion of the API development, we believe that plans and
states would  
need to conduct the following on an annual basis: allocate resources to
maintain the FHIR server,  
and perform capability and security testing.  
The burden estimate related to the new requirements for APIs reflects
the time and effort  
needed to collect the information described above and disclose this
information. We estimate an  
initial set one-time costs associated with the implementing the API
requirements. We presume  
that it will take administrators and network architects 1440 hours (at
$92.70 an hour), security  
engineers 960 hours (at $101.32 an hour), computer and information
analysts 480 hours (at  
$83.96 an hour), operations research analysts 960 hours (at $74.66 an
hour), software developers  
960 hours (at $91.14 an hour), computer and information systems managers
720 hours (at  
$142.20 an hour), general and operations managers 720 hours (at $145.02
an hour), designers  
960 hours (at $58.64 an hour), technical writers 240 hours (at $65.36 an
hour), and computer  
systems analysts 960 hours (at $83.18 an hour). We estimate a one-time
burden assessment of  

-----

<span id="175"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**175**  
8,400 (1440hrs + 960hrs + 480hrs + 960hrs + 960hrs + 720hrs + 720hrs +
960hrs + 240hrs +  
960hrs) hours per organization or state and a total of 3,898,000
(8,400hrs x 345 organizations)  
hours across all organizations or states. The one-time cost to implement
API requirements is  
$789,356.00 per organization or state per implementation and
$275,432,820 across all  
organizations or states to complete the task described above.  
Once the API is established, we believe that there would be an annual
cost for performing  
necessary capability and security testing, performing necessary upgrades
and vetting of third-  
party applications. We presume that it would take administrators and
network architects 180  
hours (at $92.70 an hour), network and computer systems administrators
420 hours (at $87.28 an  
hour), security engineers 240 hours (at $101.32 an hour), computer and
information analysts 60  
hours (at $83.96 an hour), operations research analysts 120 hours (at
$74.66 an hour), software  
developers 240 hours (at $91.14 an hour), computer and information
systems managers 90 hours  
(at $142.20 an hour), general and operations managers 90 hours (at
$145.02 an hour), designers  
120 hours (at $58.64 an hour), technical writers 30 hours (at $65.36 an
hour), and computer  
systems analysts 120 hours (at $83.96 an hour). We estimate the total
annual burden to be 1,710  
hours (180hrs + 420hrs + 60hrs + 120hrs + 240hrs + 90hrs + 120hrs +
30hrs + 120hrs) per  
organization or state, and 589,950 hours (1,710hrs x 345 organizations)
across all organizations  
and states. Thus, the total annual cost to maintain the API requirements
is $158,359.80 per  
organization or state and $54,634,131 across all organizations and
states.

the ADDRESSES section of this proposed rule.  
Comments must be received on/by \[INSERT DATE 60-DAYS AFTER THE DATE

D. Exempt ICRs  
1\. Usual and Customary Business Practices  
While the requirements under 42 CFR 482.24(d), 482.61(f) and 485.638 are
subject to the  
PRA, we believe the burden associated with those requirements is exempt
from the PRA in  
accordance with 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2). We believe that the time, effort,
and financial resources  
necessary to comply with these requirements would be incurred by persons
during the normal  
course of their activities, and therefore, should be considered usual
and customary business  
practices.  
We are proposing to further expand CMS requirements for interoperability
within the  
hospital, psychiatric hospital, and CAH CoPs by focusing on electronic
patient event  
notifications. For hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs, we are
proposing similar  

-----

<span id="177"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**177**  
requirements to revise the CoPs for Medicare- and Medicaid-participating
hospitals, psychiatric  
hospitals, and CAHs by adding a new standard, “Electronic
Notifications,” that would require  
hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs to send electronic patient
event notifications of a  
patient’s admission, discharge, and/or transfer to another health care
facility or to another  
community provider. We propose to limit this requirement to only those
hospitals, psychiatric  
hospitals, and CAHs which currently possess EHR systems with the
technical capacity to  
generate information for electronic patient event notifications,
recognizing that not all Medicare-  
and Medicaid-participating hospitals and psychiatric hospitals have been
eligible for past  
programs promoting adoption of EHR systems. We intend for these
notifications to be required,  
at minimum, for inpatients admitted to, and discharged and/or
transferred from the hospital,  
psychiatric hospital, or CAH. These requirements would help support
coordination of a patient’s  
care between settings or with services received through different care
settings. These sections  
would require updates to discharge planning processes, which has been a
long-standing industry  
practice. Electronic patient event notifications from these care
settings, or clinical event  
notifications, are one type of health information exchange intervention
that has been increasingly  
recognized as an effective and scalable tool for improving care
coordination across settings.  
These notifications are typically automated, electronic communications
from the admitting or  
discharging provider to a receiving facility or to another community
provider that alert the  
receiving provider that a patient is receiving, or has received, care at
a different setting.  
These notifications are based on “admission, discharge, and transfer”
(ADT) messages, a  
standard message used within an EHR as the vehicle for communicating
information about key  
changes in a patient’s status as they are tracked by the system (more
information about the  
current standard supporting these messages is available
at  
[http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product\_brief.cfm?product\_id=144)](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=144).

We note that hospitals have an existing responsibility under the CoPs at
42 CFR  
482.43(d) to transfer or refer patients, along with necessary medical
information, to appropriate  
facilities, agencies, or outpatient services, as needed, for follow-up
or ancillary care. We wish to  
emphasize that the proposal in this proposed rule around patient event
notifications is  
independent of the requirement regarding necessary medical information
at 42 CFR 482.43(d).  
As these processes are already required, and as many EHR systems already
have an electronic  
notification system in place, we do not anticipate a significant
increase in burden on hospitals,  
psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs with the adoption of this proposal.
However, we recognize that  
processes to implement this proposal, if finalized, might intersect with
the hospital’s discharge  
planning process. We note that nothing in this proposal would affect the
hospital’s  
responsibilities under 42 CFR 482.43(d). However, if this proposal is
finalized, hospitals might  
wish to consider ways to fulfill these requirements in ways that reduce
redundancy while still  
fully meeting the provisions of each. For instance, where appropriate,
hospitals might seek to  
include required necessary medical information within the same message
as a patient event  
notification.

**XVI. Regulatory Impact Analysis**  
A. Statement of Need  
As described in detail in section III. of this proposed rule, the
changes to 42 CFR parts  
422, 431, 438, 457 and 45 CFR part 156 are part of the agency’s broader
efforts to empower  
patients by ensuring that they have full access to their own health care
data, through common  
technologies and without special effort, while keeping that information
safe and secure.  
Interoperability and the capability for health information systems and
software applications to  
communicate, exchange, and interpret data in a usable and readable
format, such as pdf or text, is  
vital, but allowing access to health care data through pdf and text
format also limits the utility  
and sharing of the data. Moving to a system in which patients have
access of their health care  
data will help empower them to make informed decisions about their
health care, as well as share  
their data with providers who can assist these patients with their
health care. Our proposals here  
are designed to move the Medicare, MA, Medicaid, CHIP and QHP programs
further to that  
ultimate goal of empowering their enrollees. As technology has advanced,
we have encouraged  
states, health plans, and providers to adopt various forms of technology
to improve the accurate  
and timely exchange of standardized health care information; these
proposals would enable  
beneficiaries and enrollees to be active partners in the exchange of
electronic health care data by  
easily monitoring or sharing their data.  
States and CMS routinely exchange data on who is enrolled in Medicare,
and which  
parties are liable for paying that beneficiary’s Parts A and B premiums.
These “buy-in” data  
exchanges support state, CMS, and SSA premium accounting, collections,
and enrollment  
functions. We have become increasingly concerned about the limitations
of monthly buy-in data  

-----

<span id="180"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**180**  
exchanges with states. The relatively long lag in updating buy-in data
means that the state is not  
able to terminate or activate buy-in coverage sooner, so the state or
beneficiary may be paying  
premiums for longer than appropriate. We note that once the data catch
up, states and CMS  
reconcile the premiums by recouping and re-billing, so premiums
collected are ultimately  
accurate, but only with– an administratively burdensome process
involving debits and payments  
between the beneficiary, state, CMS, SSA, and potentially providers.
Daily buy-in data exchange  
would reduce this administrative burden. As described in detail in
section VII. of this proposed  
rule, the changes to 42 CFR parts 406, 407, and 423 establish frequency
requirements that  
necessitate all states to participate in daily exchange of buy-in data,
and updates frequency  
requirements to require all states to participate in daily exchange of
MMA file data, with CMS  
by April 1, 2022.  
States submit data on files at least monthly to CMS to identify all
dually eligible  
individuals, including full-benefit and partial-benefit dually eligible
beneficiaries (that is, those  
who get Medicaid help with Medicare premiums, and often for
cost-sharing). The MMA file was  
originally developed to meet the need to timely identify dually eligible
beneficiaries for the then-  
new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Over time, we used these
files’ data on dual  
eligibility status to support Part C capitation risk-adjustment, and
most recently, feeding dual  
eligibility status to Part A and B eligibility and claims processing
systems so providers,  
suppliers, and beneficiaries have accurate information on beneficiary
cost-sharing obligations.  
As CMS now utilizes MMA data on dual eligibility status in systems
supporting all four parts of  
the Medicare program, it is becoming even more essential that dual
eligibility status is accurate  
and up-to-date. Dual eligibility status can change at any time in a
month. Waiting up to a month  
for status updates can negatively impact access to the correct level of
benefit at the correct level  
of payment.

B. Overall Impact ****  
We have examined the impacts of this proposed rule as required by
Executive  
Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993),
Executive Order 13563  
on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011), the
Regulatory Flexibility  
Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96-354), section 1102(b) of the
Social Security Act,  
section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (March 22, 1995;
Pub. L. 104-4),  
Executive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999), the Congressional
Review Act  
(5 U.S.C. 804(2)), and Executive Order 13771 on Reducing Regulation and
Controlling  
Regulatory Costs (January 30, 2017).  
Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and
benefits of  
available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to
select regulatory approaches  
that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental,
public health and  
safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Section 3(f) of
Executive Order 12866 defines a  
“significant regulatory action” as an action that is likely to result in
a rule: (1) having an annual  
effect on the economy of $100 million or more in any 1 year, or
adversely and materially  
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the
environment, public health  
or safety, or state, local or tribal governments or communities (also
referred to as “economically  
significant”); (2) creating a serious inconsistency or otherwise
interfering with an action taken or  
planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts
of entitlement grants,  
user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raising novel  
legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President’s
priorities, or the principles set  
forth in the Executive Order.  
A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) must be prepared for major rules with
economically  
significant effects ($100 million or more in any 1 year). We estimate
that this rulemaking is  

-----

<span id="182"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**182**  
“economically significant” as measured by the $100 million threshold,
and hence also a major  
rule under the Congressional Review Act. Accordingly, we have prepared
an RIA that to the best  
of our ability presents the costs and benefits of the rulemaking. Table
3 summarizes the  
estimated costs presented in the Collection of Information section of
this proposed rule. We note  
that estimates below do not account for enrollment growth or higher
costs associated with  
medical care. This is because the cost of requirements to implement
patient access through APIs  
and for states to comply with data exchange requirements are not
impacted by enrollment growth  
or higher costs associated with medical care. Per OMB guidelines, the
projected estimates for  
future years do not take into account ordinary inflation.

Allocation of Cost Impact by Program: As stated in the Collection of
Information Section  
of this proposed rule, cost estimates have been aggregated at the parent
organization level  
because we believe that an organization that offers commercial,
Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP  
products would create one system that would be used by all “plans” it
offers. We note that due to  
the implementation of APIs across multiple business lines, there is no
straightforward method to  
immediately estimate Parent Organization expenditures on how much of the
cost is born by each  
program.  
Preliminary Estimates: Later in this RIA section, we provide several
detailed estimates of  

-----

<span id="183"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**183**  
cost by program where we account for Federal matching for Medicaid and
payments by the Trust  
Fund for Medicare Advantage Organizations. However, these estimates are
approximate as  
explained in detail below. Therefore, the purpose of this preliminary
estimate section, is to  
observe that the costs of this proposed rule are negligible relative to
the costs of the various  
programs it impacts.  
For purposes of clarification we use the metric of “costs per enrollee.”
The “costs per  
enrollee” whether for Medicaid or Medicare, does not refer to actual
costs paid by the enrollee  
but rather is a metric, it is the quotient of total program expenditures
divided by total enrollees.  
The cost per enrollee metric facilitates comparison of costs. Since
program expenditures for both  
Medicaid and MA are typically hundreds of millions (or billions) of
dollars, concepts like  
negligibility do not have intuitive meaning. Contrastively, the costs
per enrollee are more  
manageable and understandable. The 2018 Medicare Trust
Fund[60](CMSs.html#183) states that costs per enrollee  
are projected to be roughly $12,000 - $14,000 for contract years 2020 -
2023 (Table IV.C3). The  
costs per enrollee for the Medicaid program are similarly several
thousand dollars. We estimate  
169 million enrollees will be affected by these provisions since.
Currently there are 76, 66[61,](CMSs.html#183)  
20[62, a](CMSs.html#183)nd 72 million enrollees in the commercial,
Medicaid, MA and separate CHIP programs  
respectively.  
The total first year (implementation) cost per enrollee is $1.63 ($276.1
million cost  
(Table 3) divided by 169 million enrollees); maintenance cost per
enrollee in the following years  
are 34 cents ($56.9 million total cost (Table 3) divided by 169 million
enrollees). The

that $1.63 and $0.34 is negligible compared to the $12,000 - $14,000
cost per enrollee for the  
MA program or the several thousand-dollar cost per enrollee for the
Medicaid program has  
intuitive appeal. However, these are very rough preliminary estimates.
In the remainder of this  
RIA, we provide, subject to the limitations noted, more detailed impact
by program.  
Data Sources for Cost by Program: To obtain allocation of cost by
program we used the  
CMS public use files for MLR data, for
2016[63](CMSs.html#184),[64](CMSs.html#184)The MLR data sets are for
private insurance  
plans but the issuers of that private (commercial) insurance in many
cases also have contracts to  
provide MA, Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans and report revenue,
expense, and  
enrollment data for these plans on the commercial MLR reporting form.  
Thus, these MLR data sets omit organizations that only have Medicare or
Medicaid. The  
data from the CMS MLR files also omits: (1) the CHIP program; and (2)
Medicaid State  
Agencies. We now discuss these omissions to assess the accuracy of using
these MLR files.  
CHIP: 85 percent of the 194 CHIP managed care plans also offer Medicaid
and hence are  
covered by the parent entity. We believe it reasonable that the
remaining CHIP plans also have  
commercial offerings since it would be inefficient to operate a
CHIP-only plan as the total  
national CHIP enrollment is currently only about 7 million. Similarly,
except for one state, CHIP  
programs are run through the state Medicaid agency; again, there would
be one interoperability  
cost for the one state agency since the resulting software would be used
both by Medicaid and  
CHIP. Thus, while we are leaving out CHIP programs in this analysis
since they are not in
the  
  
63[https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data-Resources/mlr.html.](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data-Resources/mlr.html)  
64 Although the 2017 MLR data recently became available, using them
would not change the bottom line of the  
analysis. The 2016 data gives $113 billion, $157 billion and $370
billion enrollees for commercial, MA, and  
Medicaid plans respectively resulting in revenue proportions of 57.81
percent, 24.53 percent, 17.68 percent. The  
2017 data gives $119.5, $170.3 and $381.5 billion for commercial MA, and
Medicaid plans resulting in proportions  
of 56.8 percent, 25.36 percent, and 17.79 percent. The 76 million
commercial enrollees from the 2016 data  
decreased to 73.5 million in 2017. Using these alternate proportions and
numbers would not change significantly our  
dollar-per-enrollee estimates of impacts.

****

****  
**185**  
CMS MLR files, we do not believe this materially alters the overall
picture.  
Medicare Advantage: We compared the CMS MLR files with the CMS Trustee
Report[65](CMSs.html#185).  
According to the Trustee Report (Table IV.C2), total MA revenue for 2016
was $189.1 billion.  
Thus, the reported amount in the CMS MLR files of $157 billion for MA
represents 83 percent  
(157/189.1) of all MA activity reflected in the Trustee Report.
Therefore, we believe the  
proportions obtained from these MLR files are accurate.  
Medicaid: For the year for which these MLR files provide data, 2016,
about 70 percent of  
Medicaid enrollees were enrolled in Medicaid Managed
Care.[66](CMSs.html#185)Thus although the MLR files  
omit State Agencies, we believe that the 70 percent Medicaid enrollees
enrolled in Medicaid  
Managed Care provides a good approximation.  
Finally, as noted in the section “Preliminary Estimates”, independent of
these omissions,  
the average cost per enrollee is capped at $1.63 and $0.34 in first and
follow up years.  
Best Estimates of Impact per Program: We present two methods to obtain
an estimate of  
cost by program both for purposes of assessing impact on small entities,
as well as for purposes  
of assessing impacts of the provision on the Federal government,
programs, and enrollees: We  
could assume costs proportional to current enrollment, or alternatively,
we could assume costs  
proportional to total premium. For purposes of analyzing impact on small
entities and impacts of  
the provision on the Federal Government, programs, and enrollees we are
using the method of  
assuming costs proportional to total premium (the method of assuming
costs proportional to  
current enrollment will be used below to assess impact on transfers to
enrollees).  
Among issuers with products in both Commercial and MA or Commercial and
Medicaid,  
the 2016 CMS MLR files show $370 billion reported in premium for
commercial plans, $157

billion reported for MA, and $113 billion reported for Medicaid.
Consequently, the proportion of  
interoperability cost for each of the programs is 57.81 percent
(370/(370+157+113)), 24.53  
percent (157/(370+157+113)), and 17.66 percent (113/(370+157+113)) for
Commercial, MA ,  
and Medicaid respectively.  
Using these proportions, Table 4 breaks out the top row in Table 3, the
total cost by year  
of implementing and maintaining the API, by program.

Methods of Bearing Cost by Program: Commercial plans have the options to
deal with  
increased costs by either temporarily absorbing them (for purposes of
market competitiveness),  
increasing premiums to enrollees, or reducing benefits.  
  
To the extent that issuers increase premiums for plans in the FFE, there
would be Federal  
premium tax credit (PTC) impacts. However, the PTC formula is highly
individual-specific, that  
is, it is the result of the relationship between the premium of the
second lowest-cost silver plan  
applicable to a specific consumer in a specific month, the cost of the
actual plan purchased by  
that consumer for that month, and that consumer’s income. Consequently,
it would not be  
possible to estimate the magnitude of the PTC impact with a reliable
degree of accuracy, since  
we cannot predict: (1) what proportion of costs would be passed on to
enrollees as increased  
premiums; (2) to what extent commercial issuers may recoup investment
costs through raising  
premiums on the second-lowest cost silver plans or on other plans; and
(3) whether or in what  
ways such premium increases may impact the PTC calculation or
eligibility with respect to  
various consumers,

<span id="187"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**187**  
  
To deal with this uncertainty, we list the possible Federal PTC impacts
as a qualitative  
impact. Most importantly, we assume the unlikely worst case scenario
that all cost is passed on  
as premium to the enrollee without subsidization; we then show that the
net impact per enrollee  
per month is extremely small (see Table 7).  
Medicare Advantage: Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) pass
increased costs  
back to the Trust Fund. For those (most) MAOs whose bid amount is below
the benchmark, the  
Trust Fund provides total expenditures to the MAOs consisting of: (1)
full payment of the bid  
amount; and (2) the rebate, a portion of the difference between the
benchmark and the bid  
amount. Since MAOs are increasing their bid amounts to reflect the costs
of this proposed rule, it  
follows that the rebate, equaling the difference between the benchmark
and bid, is decreased,  
resulting in less rebates paid to the MAOs. Based on our historical and
projected experience, the  
rebate is estimated as 34 percent of the difference between benchmark
and bid. Thus, although  
the Trust Fund pays the bid in full, nevertheless, 66 percent of the
increased bid costs arising  
from this proposed rule, are reduced from the rebates. The MAO in its
submitted bid, can address  
this reduction of rebates by either: (1) temporarily, for marketing
purposes, absorbing the loss,  
and reducing its profit margin; (2) reduce the additional benefits it
provides the enrollee paid for  
by the rebate; or (3) raise enrollee premiums.  
Medicaid: State Medicaid agencies may be allowed to allocate the costs
of state  
information retrieval systems between the costs attributable to design,
development, installation,  
or enhancement of the system—at a 90 percent federal match—and for
ongoing operations of the  
system—at a 75 percent federal match.  
For Medicaid Managed Care entities, we assume an MCO, PIHP, and PAHP
cost for  
implementing the open API provisions would be built into the capitation
rates and matched at the  
State’s medical assistance match rate. For purposes of these estimates
we use the weighted  

-----

<span id="188"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

**188**  
FMAP, 58.44.  
CHIP: Most states operate Medicaid and CHIP from the same state agency.
One state is a  
notable exception in that it has a separate Medicaid and CHIP agency.
The federal government  
pays an enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (EFMAP) to states
for all costs  
associated with CHIP, including systems costs (this is unlike Medicaid
where there are different  
FMAPs for different types of costs). For federal FY 2019 the EFMAPs will
range from 88 to 100  
percent. For federal FY 2020 the EFMAPs will range from approximately
76.5 to 93 percent.  
After federal FY 2020, the EFMAPs will range from approximately 65 to
81.5 percent. Since the  
CHIP program Federal rebate ranges include the 90 percent and 75 percent
federal matching  
proportions of the Medicaid program, we are applying the 90 percent and
75 percent from  
Medicaid to the CHIP programs. Since the CHIP program is small relative
to the Medicaid  
program, we believe this approach reasonable.  
Table 5 uses these proportions to estimate the impact of the API on the
Federal  
Government. For example, the $28.4 million cost to the Federal
government for Medicaid/CHIP  
for 2020, the implementation year of the API, is obtained by multiplying
the State Agency  
Medical Assistance average match rate to Medicaid Managed Care Plans,
58.44%, by the $48.6  
million total cost to Medicaid for 2020 listed in Table 4.

remaining costs for the API. To this amount must be added the
coordination cost for the dual  
eligibles (row 2 of Table 3). For example, Medicaid/CHIP has a remaining
cost of $20.3 million  
($48.6 million total cost for 2020 (Table 4) - $28.4 million matched by
Medicaid State Agencies  
(Table 5) + $0.7 million total cost for coordination of dual eligibles
(Table 3) \* 17.66 percent  
(proportion of total costs incurred by Medicaid/CHIP (Table 4)). (There
are minor differences  
due to rounding). The results are summarized in Table 6.

The further discussion of bearing these costs, is clarified, if we
reformulate the costs in  
terms of costs per enrollee. To do this we use enrollments by program.
For commercial  
enrollment we use the 2016 MLR data, for MA enrollment we use the August
2018 data, and for  
Medicaid and CHIP we use September 2018 data. These enrollment numbers
are 76, 66[67, 2068,](CMSs.html#189)  
and 74 million enrollees in the commercial, Medicaid, MA and separate
CHIP programs  
respectively. Thus, for purposes of this analysis, we use a total of 169
million (76+67+20+6)  
enrollees in all programs. Table 7 presents cost per enrollee by program
and year. For example,  
there is a 28-cent cost to Medicaid/CHIP state agencies in 2020 (20.3
million remaining cost  
(Table 6) divided by 73 million (66 million Medicaid + 7 million
CHIP)).[69](CMSs.html#189)

69 To give an idea of how the per enrollee per year numbers would change
had we used updated enrollment, we note  
that the latest MA enrollment (as of January 2019) is for January 2019
and is 22 million, the latest Medicaid  
enrollment is for Oct 2018 and is still 73 million, and the latest
commercial enrollment is for 2017 and is 73.5. The  
resulting per-enrollee-per-year cost impacts would be $2.17, 0.28, and
$2.04 versus the numbers in Table 7 which  
are $2.10, 0.28, and $2.24. These changes per enrollee per year would
not affect any of our conclusions about  
negligibility relative to the 4 and 5 digit per enrollee per year
expenses for Medicare, Medicaid and the Federally  
Funded exchange.

Using Table 7 we can assess the approximate impact of the remaining
cost.  
Commercial: As pointed out above, the Commercial program has the options
of  
absorbing costs or passing costs to enrollees either in the form of
premiums or reduced benefits.  
The cost per enrollee in 2021 through 2024 is under a half dollar and
could comfortably be  
passed on to enrollees. For purposes of market competitiveness, it is
very likely that some of the  
2020 cost of $2.10 per enrollee will be absorbed by each QHP in an
FFE.  
Medicaid: Medicaid state agencies are adding a cost under 30 cents per
enrollee for 2020-  
2024\. Since total costs per enrollee for the Medicaid program are
several thousand dollars we do  
not believe this additional 30 cents per enrollee cost to be a
significant burden.  
Medicare Advantage: Medicare Advantage plans in their June-submitted
bids would  
address the reduced rebates (arising from increased bid costs due to the
increased costs of this  
proposed rule being included in the bid) by either: (1) temporarily
absorbing costs by reducing  
profit margins; (2) reducing additional benefits paid for by the
rebates; or (3) raising enrollee  
cost sharing (however, many plans for competitive reasons would chose to
remain zero premium  
and either absorb losses for one year or reduce additional,
rebate-funded benefits in the amount  
per enrollee shown in Table 7).  
Table 8 summarizes these methods of bearing the remaining costs.

**TABLE 8: How Programs Would Defray Remaining Costs**  
**Line**  
**Potential Plan**  
Commercial plans have the options of absorbing costs (for example, in
2020 for reasons of market  
Commercial  
competitiveness), increasing premiums to enrollees, or reducing
benefits.  
Medicaid Managed Care plan would bear the cost (under a dime per
enrollee) which is negligible  
Medicaid/CHIP  
compared to current costs per enrollee.  
MA plans in their June-submitted bids would address the reduced rebates
(arising from increased bid  
Medicare  
costs due to the increased costs of this proposed rule being included in
the bid) by either: (1)  
Advantage  
temporarily absorbing costs by reducing profit margins; (2) reducing
additional benefits paid for by  
(MA)  
the rebates; or (3) raising enrollee cost sharing (however, many plans
for competitive reasons would  
chose to remain zero premium and either absorb losses for one year or
reduce additional, rebate-  
funded benefits in the amount per enrollee shown in Table 7).  
  
C. Anticipated Effects  
The RFA, as amended, requires agencies to analyze options for regulatory
relief of small  
businesses, if a rule has a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities. For  
purposes of the RFA, small entities include small businesses, nonprofit
organizations, and small  
governmental jurisdictions.  
This proposed rule affects (1) Commercial Issuers (2) MA plans,
including those that are  
also Part D sponsors of MA-PD plans, as well as (3) Medicaid MCOs with a
minimum threshold  
for small business size of $38.5 milli[on
(https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-](https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-guide/size-standards)  
[guide/size-standards)](https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-guide/size-standards)).  
Assessment of impact is complicated by the fact that costs have been
aggregated at the  
Parent Organization level. A typical Parent Organization might have
products with the  
commercial, MA, or Medicaid /CHIP programs. We have no way of directly
assessing the size of  
Parent Organizations. Therefore, as a proxy, we analyze each program
separately.  
Medicare Advantage: We first assess the impact on MA plans. To clarify
the flow of  
payments between these entities and the federal government, we note that
MAOs submit  
proposed plan designs and estimates of the amount of revenue necessary
to cover the cost of  
those plan designs (called bids) by the first Monday in June of the year
preceding the coverage  

-----

<span id="192"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

**192**  
year. Regulations governing this process are in 42 CFR part 422, subpart
F. These bids must be  
broken down in the following:  
(1) The revenue requirements for providing Medicare Part A and Part B
benefits with  
actuarially equivalent cost sharing (this is the “basic benefit bid”);  
(2) The revenue requirements for providing supplemental benefits; and  
(3) A Part D bid consistent with Part D regulations in 42 CFR part
423.  
These bids project payments to hospitals, providers and staff, as well
as the cost of  
administration and profits. Because the API requirements proposed in
this rule will apply to  
every MA plan and each MA plan must furnish at least the Medicare Part A
and Part B benefits,  
the cost of the API will be built into the administrative component of
the basic benefit bid. These  
bids in turn determine one component of the payments of the Medicare
Trust Fund to the MAOs  
who reimburse providers and other stakeholders for their services. A
second component of the  
Trust Fund payment to MAOs are the rebates, which are a portion of the
difference between the  
basic benefit bid compared to an administratively-set benchmark for the
MA plan’s service area  
(currently, based on our past and projected experience, rebates are
approximately 66 percent)  
Benchmarks are based on a formula using an estimate of the Medicare FFE
per capita cost for  
the geographic area, which are adjusted to reflect the per capita cost
of each county in the United  
States and its territories. Payments from the Medicare Trust Funds for
monthly capitation are  
capped at the benchmark; for basic benefit bids under the benchmark, a
portion, currently 66  
percent, of the difference between the bid and benchmark is made
available to the MA  
organization to either: (1) pay the premium for supplemental benefits;
(2) include reductions in  
cost sharing; (3) provide additional non-Medicare covered benefits; or
(4) provide buy-downs of  
Part B or Part D premiums. Basic benefit bids that are at or above the
benchmark receive  
payment from the Trust Funds of the benchmark amount, with any excess
charged to the enrollee  

-----

as a premium.  
  
MAOs are made aware of the benchmark through the annual CMS
publication,  
“Medicare **** Advantage Capitation Rates and Medicare Advantage and
Part D Payment Policies  
and Final Call Letter,” which, consistent with section 1853 of the Act,
is released prior to MAO  
submission of bids. Therefore, the bids of most MAOs are below the
benchmark and  
consequently most MAOs receive from the Trust Fund a total expenditure
equaling payment for  
the bid plus the rebate.  
  
Because of these proposed API provisions, MAOs would be raising the
June-submitted  
bid amount to reflect additional costs. While the Trust Fund pays these
bid amounts in full, the  
rebate goes down: That is, since the bid amount goes up, the rebate,
equaling the difference  
between the benchmark and bid, decreases and results in less rebate
payment to the MAO. The  
MAO has several options of dealing with these increased bid costs and
reduced rebates: The  
MAO might decide to: (1) temporarily absorb the loss by reducing its
profit margin (so as to  
reduce the bid amount and thereby increase the rebates); (2) reduce
additional benefits paid to  
the enrollee from the rebates; or (3) raise enrollee premiums so as to
compensate for the  
reduction of enrollee premium that would have happened if the bid had
not been increased (note:  
for marketing purposes, many plans operate at zero premium, and we do
not consider this a  
likely possibility). In this RIA we have referred to options (2) and (3)
reduction of additional  
benefits and raising of enrollee premiums as “passing the costs to the
enrollee” the intent being  
that the “effect” of reduced rebates is less additional benefits or
higher enrollee premiums than  
would have happened had the cost of the provisions of this proposed rule
not been included in  
the bid.  
There are various types of Medicare health plans, including MA HMOs, POS
plans, and  
PPOs; Demonstration plans; Cost Plans; Prescription Drug Plans (PDP);
and Programs of All-  

-----

<span id="194"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**194**  
Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) organizations. This proposed rule
affects MA HMOs, MA  
POS plans, and MA PPOs but does not affect Cost Plans, Prescription Drug
Plans nor PACE  
organizations.  
There are a variety of ways to assess whether MAOs meet the $38.5
million threshold for  
small businesses. The assessment can be done by examining net worth, net
income, cash flow  
from operations and projected claims as indicated in their bids. Using
projected monetary  
requirements and projected enrollment for 2018 from submitted bids, 32
percent of the MAOs  
fell below the $38.5 million threshold for small businesses.
Additionally, an analysis of 2016  
data, the most recent year for which we have actual data on MAO net
worth, shows that 33  
percent of all MAOs fall below the minimum threshold for small
businesses.  
Medicaid: We next assess the impact on Medicaid MCOs. The Society of
Actuaries  
(SOA) published “Medicaid Managed Care Organizations: Considerations in
Calculating Margin  
in Rate Setting” in 2017.[70](CMSs.html#194)The report provided an MS
Excel spreadsheet of Medicaid MCOs  
using data from 2013 – 2015. That report noted that “\[n\]ot every state
requires Medicaid MCOs  
to submit Annual Statements, so not every MCO is represented. MCOs in
California and Arizona  
are shown with a limited set of metrics, based on what was available and
provided by HMA  
\[Health Management Associates\].” Of the 231 MCOs listed in the 2015
worksheet, 196 provided  
data that are adequate to identify MCOs with annual “revenue” less than
$38.5 million. (NOTE:  
Since total revenue is reported at the company level, which includes
revenue from non-Medicaid  
sources, we used “direct premium written” in the Medicaid portion of the
worksheet as a proxy  
for annual revenue on the individual plan level.) Of the 196 Medicaid
MCOs, only 15 MCOs or  
7.7 percent had “revenue” less than $38.5 million in 2015.

**195**  
Commercial: Based on the 2016 CMS MLR data, approximately 85 out of 494,
or 17  
percent of companies (that either had only commercial business, or had
commercial plus  
Medicare and/or Medicaid business) had total premium revenue of less
than $38,500,000. In  
other words, for MA, Medicaid, and Commercial, a significant number of
small plans are  
affected. The RFA requires us to assess whether the rule has a
significant impact on the plans  
which we do next.  
If a proposed rule has a substantial impact on a substantial number of
small entities, the  
proposed rule must discuss steps taken, including alternatives, to
minimize burden on small  
entities. While a significant number (more than 5 percent) of
not-for-profit organizations and  
small businesses are affected by this final rule, the impact is not
significant. To assess impact, we  
use the data in Table 3 of this section which shows that the total raw
(not discounted) net effect  
of this final rule over 5 years is 500 million dollars.  
Medicare Advantage: We first assess impact on MA plans. Comparing the
500 million  
dollar number to the total monetary amounts projected to be needed just
for 2018, the most  
recent year on which we have finalized plan submitted bid data (and
which is expected to be less  
than the need in future years including 2019), we find that that the
impact of this proposed rule is  
significantly below the 3 percent-5 percent threshold for significant
impact for MA plans.  
Medicaid: We next assess impact on Medicaid Managed Care plans. The
total projected  
capitation payment and premiums for 2019 is projected to be $337.6
billion.[71](CMSs.html#195) Hence, the total  
cost of this proposed rule over 5 years, $500 million, is significantly
below the 3 percent-5  
percent threshold for significant impact to Medicaid Managed Care
plans.

<span id="196"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****

****  
**196**  
Commercial: As discussed prior to Table 4, based on data in the public,
CMS MLR files,  
commercial plans had a revenue of at least $370 billion in 2016. We say
at least, because this  
only includes organizations with either: (1) only commercial; (2) both
commercial and MA; or  
(3) both commercial and Medicaid. Had all organizations been included in
the CMS MLR files  
(including those that only offer MA and/or Medicaid) the amount would be
greater than $370  
billion. Therefore, the aggregate raw cost of this proposed rule over 5
years, $500 million, is  
significantly below the 3 percent – 5 percent threshold for significant
impact to Commercial  
plans.  
We conclude, that although a significant number of small plans in all
programs are  
affected by this rule, this impact is not significant.  
Besides the fact that the impact is not significant, we are not
concerned that small plans  
will have a burden in implementing these requirements since as indicated
above, without  
considering any rebates or Federal matching funds, the cost of this
provision is $1.63 per  
enrollee per year in the first implementation year, and $0.34 in the
following years for  
maintenance, these per enrollee costs are negligible when compared to
the typical costs per  
enrollee (several thousand dollars).  
Consequently, the Secretary has determined that this proposed rule will
not have a  
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
and the requirements of the  
RFA have been met. Please see our detailed analysis of apportionment of
costs per program and  
plan in Tables 4 through 8 and section XVI.H. of this proposed rule for
further details.  
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires CMS to prepare an RIA
if a rule may  
have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of
small rural hospitals. This  
analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For
purposes of section  
1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that
is located outside a  

-----

<span id="197"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**197**  
Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 100 beds. We are not
preparing an analysis for  
section 1102(b) of the Act because we have determined, and the Secretary
certifies, that this  
proposed rule would not have a significant impact on the operations of a
substantial number of  
small rural hospitals.  
Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Pub. L.
104-04,  
enacted March 22, 1995) also requires that agencies assess anticipated
costs and benefits before  
issuing any rule whose mandates require spending in any 1 year of $100
million in 1995 dollars,  
updated annually for inflation. In 2018, that is approximately $150
million. The apportionment  
of total cost between the MA, Medicaid, Commercial and Chip programs is
detailed in both  
section XVI.B. (Tables 4 through 8) and section XVI.H of this RIA
showing that costs for both  
enrollees and the states are small. Executive Order 13132 establishes
certain requirements that an  
agency must meet when it promulgates a proposed rule (and subsequent
final rule) that imposes  
substantial direct requirement costs on state and local governments,
preempts state law, or  
otherwise has Federalism implications. This rule will not have a
substantial direct effect on state  
or local governments, preempt state law, or otherwise have a Federalism
implication. Therefore,  
the requirements of Executive Order 13132 are not applicable.  
If regulations impose administrative costs, such as the time needed to
read and interpret  
this proposed rule, we should estimate the cost associated with
regulatory review. There are  
currently 288 organizations and 56 states and territories. We assume
each organization will have  
one designated staff member who will read the entire rule.  
Using the wage information from the BLS for medical and health service
managers  
(Code 11–9111), we estimate that the cost of reviewing this rule is
$139.14 per hour, including  
overhead and fringe benefits
[(https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics5\_524114.htm).](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics5_524114.htm)
Assuming  
an average reading speed, we estimate that it would take approximately 6
hours for each person

**198**  
to review this proposed rule. For each plan and state that reviews the
rule, the estimated cost is  
$834.84 (6 hours × $139.14). Therefore, we estimate that the total cost
of reviewing this  
regulation is $288,020 ($834.84 × 345 reviewers).  
1\. Requirements for Patient Access Through APIs  
To promote our commitment to interoperability, we are proposing new
requirements in  
section III. of this proposed rule for MA organizations at 42 CFR
422.119, Medicaid FFS at 42  
CFR 431.60, Medicaid managed care at 42 CFR 438.242, CHIP FFS at 42 CFR
457.730, CHIP  
managed care at 42 CFR 457.1233, and QHP issuers, excluding SADP
issuers, that offer plans  
through the FFE at 45 CFR 156.221 to implement open APIs for making
certain data available to  
enrollees and the public. These openly published APIs will permit
third-party applications to  
retrieve standardized data for adjudicated claims, encounters with
capitated and subcapitated  
providers, provider remittances, beneficiary cost-sharing, reports of
lab test results, provider  
directories, and preferred drug lists. We believe that these proposals
are designed to empower  
patients by mandating that entities subject to our API proposal take
steps – by implementing the  
API – to enable enrollees to have access to their data in a usable
digital format and have  
(potentially) easier means to share that data. By making these data
readily available and portable  
to the patient, these initiatives support moving our healthcare system
away from a FFS payment  
system that pays for volume and toward a payment system that pays for
value and quality by  
reducing duplication of services, adding efficiency to provider visits,
and facilitating  
identification of fraud, waste, and abuse.  
To estimate the number of impacted issuers, we reviewed parent
organizations of health  
plans across MA, Medicaid MCOs, and QHPs in FFEs to remove organizations
that would not  
be subject to our proposal, such as SADPs; transportation plans and
brokers such as non-  
emergency medical transportation (NEMTs) brokers; PACE; visiting nurse
and home health care  

-----

<span id="199"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****

****  
**199**  
organizations; senior organizations such as Area Agencies on Aging; and
other organizations  
such as community action programs. After removing these organizations,
we then reviewed the  
remaining names of parent organizations and health plans in the National
Association of  
Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Consumer Information Support (CIS) system
to determine the  
legal name of the entity and whether the entity was registered with the
NAIC. We also used the  
2018 NAIC Listing of Companies to determine whether various health plans
had associated  
parent organizations using the NAIC’s Group coding and numbering system.
If the health plan or  
parent organization did not appear in the NAIC CIS or in the 2018 NAIC
Listing of Companies,  
we then reviewed the name of the entity in the Securities and Exchange
online Edgar system to  
locate the entity’s Form 10-K filing, which includes an Exhibit (Exhibit
21) that requires the  
entity to list its subsidiaries. If the health plan or organization did
not appear in these online  
systems or listings, an online internet search using Google search
engine was conducted. After  
review, we have determined that 288 issuers and 56 states, territories,
and U.S. commonwealths,  
which operate FFS programs, will be subject to the API provisions for
Medicare, Medicaid, and  
the Commercial market. To this we add the one state that operates its
CHIP and Medicaid  
separately. Thus, we have a total of 345 parent entities (288+56+1). We
note that although 42  
states have some lower-income children in an expansion of Medicaid, and
some higher-income  
children or pregnant women in a separate CHIP, all but one of these
programs are operated out of  
the same agency. Although the CHIP programs may be distinct, we believe
they will use the  
same infrastructure built for Medicaid. Thus, the addition of 1 parent
entity for CHIP is  
reasonable and plausible.  
As noted in section XIII.C.3. of this proposed rule, to implement the
new requirements  
for APIs, we estimate that organizations and states would conduct three
major work phases:  
initial design; development and testing; and long-term support and
maintenance. (For a detailed

description of these phases, see section XIII.C.3. of this proposed
rule.)  
  
As part of our research into the regulatory impact, we reviewed a sample
of health plan  
organizations offering MA plans to determine whether any currently offer
patient portal  
functionality with the MA plan. If yes, we reviewed whether they offered
the opportunity to  
connect to Medicare’s Blue Button 2.0. Health plan organizations
offering MA plans were  
identified from June 2018 data and statistics compiled
at[https://www.cms.gov/Research-](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MCRAdvPartDEnrolData/index.html)  
[Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MCRAdvPartDEnrolData/index.html.](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MCRAdvPartDEnrolData/index.html)  
We initially reviewed the functionality offered by three organizations
which together enroll over  
half of MA members through review of publicly-available information such
as press releases and  
website informational materials. We found from this review that these
organizations not only  
offered patient portals primarily focused on claims and user-entered
data on their website, but  
that all three also offered enrollees the opportunity to connect to Blue
Button. We then identified  
a selection of other health plan organizations at random and conducted
the same evaluation.  
Results indicate that the majority of the health plan organizations we
reviewed offer patients a  
way to access claims data and other information via their websites and
sometimes via  
applications. Regarding Blue Button access, results were either negative
or unclear.  
  
We also cross-referenced health plan organizations offering MA plans
with health plan  
organizations that offer plans in the Federal Employee Health Benefit
(FEHB) program because  
a percentage of those organizations offer plans with patient portal
access and Blue Button  
functionality. The FEHB, administered by the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM), reported  
in 2014 that 90 percent of its participating plans offered enrollees
access to a personal health  
record on the organization’s website. In addition, OPM reported that
over half of the FEHB  
participating plans expected to offer Blue Button functionality by
January 1, 2016. We sought to  
learn whether there was any overlap between these two lists of
organizations to gauge whether  

-----

<span id="201"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**201**  
additional organizations may already have the capability to offer either
patient portals or Blue  
Button, albeit in a different business arm, as having internal
capability may assuage some of the  
cost of building out a new API to support patient access to claims data.
While we found  
significant overlap between UnitedHealthcare and the Blue Cross Blue
Shield Affiliates, we also  
were able to identify other organizations that offer both MA plans and
plans included in the  
FEHB. While not definitive, this data allows us to draw the conclusion
that a number of health  
plan organizations have the technology in place to offer patient portals
to MA enrollees and,  
further, also have the ability to offer MA enrollees Blue Button
functionality.  
As detailed in the Collection of Information section of this proposed
rule and summarized  
in Table 3, given the current state of interoperability, we estimate the
burden related to the new  
requirements for APIs to have an initial set one-time costs of $798,356
per implementation or an  
aggregate cost of $275,432,820 ($798,356 x 345 parent entities). For a
detailed discussion of the  
one-time costs associated with implementing the API requirements we
refer readers to section  
XIII.C.3. of this proposed rule. Once the API is established we believe
that there will be an  
annual cost for performing necessary capability and security testing,
performing necessary  
upgrades and vetting of third party applications. We estimate the burden
related to the  
requirements for APIs to have an annual cost of $158,406 per
implementation or an aggregate  
cost of $54,650,070 (345 parent entities x $158,406). For a detailed
discussion of the annual  
costs associated with implementing the API requirements, we refer
readers to section XIII.C.3.  
of this proposed rule.  
We are committed to fulfilling our role in promoting interoperability,
putting patients  
first and ensuring they have access to their health care data. We
recognize that there are  
significant opportunities to modernize access to patient data and its
ability to share across the  
health ecosystem. We realize the importance of interoperability and the
capability for health  

-----

<span id="202"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**202**  
information systems and software applications to communicate, exchange,
and interpret data in a  
usable and readable format. Although allowing access to healthcare data
through pdf and text  
format is vital, it limits the utility of the data, and its ability to
be easily accessed and shared.  
Additionally, we realize that moving to a system in which patients have
access to their healthcare  
data will ultimately empower them to make informed decisions about their
healthcare. Our  
proposals here do not go as far as our goals for how patients will be
ultimately empowered but  
take steps in that direction.  
We note that the federal government has spent over $35 billion under the
EHR Incentive  
Programs[72](CMSs.html#202) to incentivize the adoption of EHR systems;
however, despite the fact that 78 percent  
of physicians and 96 percent of hospitals now use an EHR
system[73](CMSs.html#202), progress on system-wide  
data sharing has been limited. Previous attempts to advance
interoperability have made  
incremental progress but have failed to align the necessary stakeholders
to drive momentum in a  
single direction. Recently, the Administration launched the
MyHealthEData initiative.[74](CMSs.html#202) This  
government-wide initiative aims to empower patients by ensuring that
they have full access to  
their own healthcare data and the ability to decide how their data will
be used, while keeping that  
information safe and secure. MyHealthEData aims to break down the
barriers that prevent  
patients from gaining electronic access to their healthcare data and
allow them to access that data  
from the device or application of their choice that will connect to a
plan’s API, empowering  
patients and taking a critical step toward interoperability and patient
data exchange.  
Health plans should have the ability to exchange data instantly with
other payers for care

coordination or transitions, and with providers to facilitate more
efficient care. Health plans are  
in a unique position to provide enrollees a complete picture of their
claims and encounter data,  
allowing patients to piece together their own information that might
otherwise be lost in  
disparate systems. We are committed to solving the issue of
interoperability and achieving  
complete patient access in the U.S. health care system and are taking an
active approach using all  
available policy levers and authorities available to move all
participants in the health care market  
toward interoperability and the secure exchange of health care data. The
modern internet app  
economy thrives on an open API software environment. Part of the health
care API evolution is  
incorporating many of the current protocols from leading standards
development organizations  
with the newer Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) web
developer-friendly way  
of representing clinical data.  
2\. Increasing the Frequency of Federal-State Data Exchanges for Dually
Eligible Individuals  
We routinely exchange data with states on who is enrolled in Medicare,
and which parties  
are liable for paying that beneficiary’s Part A and B premiums. These
buy-in data exchanges  
support state, CMS, and SSA premium accounting, collections, and
enrollment functions. CMS  
subregulatory guidance, specifically Chapter 3 of the State Buy-in
Manual, specifies that states  
should exchange buy-in data with CMS at least monthly, but provides the
option for states to  
exchange buy-in data with CMS daily or weekly. Likewise, states can
choose to receive the CMS  
response data on a file daily or monthly. Currently, 31 states and the
District of Columbia now  
submit buy-in data to CMS, daily and 28 states and the District of
Columbia receive buy-in  
response files from CMS daily.  
We are proposing to establish the frequency requirements in the
regulation itself to  
require all states to participate in daily exchange of buy-in data to
CMS, with “daily” meaning  
every business day, but that if no new transactions are available to
transmit, data would not need  

-----

<span id="204"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**204**  
to be submitted on a given business day. We propose that states would be
required to begin  
participating in daily exchange of buy-in data with CMS by April 1,
2022.  
We estimate the cost for states to comply with these new requirements to
be one-time  
costs associated with state systems updates, totaling $3,273,965 across
impacted states and over  
the 3-year implementation period. We first identified those states
already exchanging data daily,  
and then determined there are 19 states that we anticipate will need to
make a systems change to  
send buy-in data to CMS daily, and 22 states that we anticipate will
need to make a systems  
change to receive buy-in data from CMS daily. We then estimated that
each change would  
involve 960 hours of computer analyst time at $83.18 per hour, for a
one-time cost to be a little  
less than $80,000 per state, per change. So, a state that needs to make
systems updates to both  
send buy-in data daily, and receive buy-in data daily would have a
one-time cost of just under  
$160,000. We did not estimate any savings related to exchanging buy-in
data with greater  
frequency, as data lags only delay when states are billed for premium
costs; delays do not impact  
the effective date and total costs. While we did not estimate premium
savings (since premium  
collection is ultimately correct), we anticipate that states may
experience longer term reduction  
in administrative burden of making those corrections.  
States submit data on MMA files at least monthly to CMS to identify all
dually eligible  
individuals, including full-benefit and partial-benefit dually eligible
beneficiaries (that is, those  
who get Medicaid help with Medicare premiums, and often cost-sharing).
While 42 CFR  
423.910(d) requires states to submit at least one MMA file each month,
states have the option to  
submit multiple MMA files throughout the month (up to one per day). As
CMS now utilizes  
MMA data on dual eligibility status in systems supporting all four parts
of the Medicare  
program, it is becoming even more essential that dual eligibility status
is accurate and up-to-date.  
We are proposing to update the frequency requirements in 42 CFR
423.910(d) to require  

-----

<span id="205"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**205**  
that starting April 1, 2022, all states submit the required MMA file
data to CMS daily, and to  
make conforming edits to 42 CFR 423.910(b)(1). Daily would mean every
business day, but that  
if no new transactions are available to transmit, data would not need to
be submitted on a given  
business day. We estimate the cost for states to comply with these new
requirements to be a one-  
time cost associated with state systems updates, totaling $3,034,406
across impacted states, and  
across the 3 years which states have to implement the requirement. There
are 37 states and the  
District of Columbia that we anticipate will need to make a systems
change to send MMA data to  
CMS daily. We estimate the one-time cost for a state to be a little less
than $80,000 for this  
MMA data systems change. For a detailed discussion of the costs
associated with these  
requirements we refer readers to section XIII.C. of this proposed rule.
We did not estimate any  
savings related to submitting MMA files daily, as data lags only delay
when data are sent; delays  
do not impact the effective date and total costs. While we did not
estimate savings, we anticipate  
that states may experience longer term reduction in administrative
burden.  
If these proposals are finalized as proposed, we anticipate that states
would have  
approximately 3 years to implement daily exchange of buy-in and MMA
data. For each state  
there would be a one-time cost to make needed systems changes, and
thereafter, no new on-  
going costs. States will have the ability to choose, in consultation
with CMS, when in the 3-year  
implementation period they want to make this change, with numerous
factors impacting in which  
year they would do so. For the purposes of this impact analysis, we
estimated an even  
distribution beginning in May 2019 and ending in April 2022. The total
cost impact over the 3-  
year implementation period for this provision is $6,308,371 ($3,273,965
+$3,034,406),  
comprising $0.7 million in FY 2019, $2.2 million in FY 2020, $2.2
million in FY 2021, and $1.2  
million in FY 2022. Since the proposed effective date is April 1, 2022,
we estimate no costs for  
FY 2023.

3\. Revisions to the Conditions of Participation for Hospitals and
Critical Access Hospitals  
(CAHs)  
We are seeking to further expand CMS requirements for interoperability
within the  
hospital and CAH CoPs by focusing on electronic patient event
notifications. We are proposing  
new requirements in section X. of this proposed rule for hospitals at 42
CFR 482.24(d)), for  
psychiatric hospitals at 42 CFR 482.61(f), and for CAHs at 42 CFR
485.638. Specifically, for  
hospitals, psychiatric hospitals and CAHs, we are proposing similar
requirements to revise the  
CoPs for Medicare- and Medicaid-participating hospitals, psychiatric
hospitals, and CAHs by  
adding a new standard, “Electronic Notifications,” that would require
hospitals, psychiatric  
hospitals, and CAHs to make electronic patient event notifications
available to another  
healthcare facility or to another community provider. We propose to
limit this requirement to  
only those hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and CAHs which currently
possess EHR systems with  
the technical capacity to generate information for electronic patient
event notifications,  
recognizing that not all Medicare- and Medicaid-participating hospitals
have been eligible for  
past programs promoting adoption of EHR systems. We propose that these
notifications would  
need to be sent at admission and either immediately prior to or at the
time of the patient’s  
discharge or transfer to licensed and qualified practitioners, other
patient care team members,  
and PAC services providers and suppliers that: (1) receive the
notification for treatment, care  
coordination, or quality improvement purposes; (2) have an established
care relationship with the  
patient relevant to his or her care; and (3) for whom the hospital,
psychiatric hospital, or CAH  
has a reasonable certainty of receipt of notifications. As we noted,
infrastructure supporting the  
exchange of electronic health information across settings has matured
substantially in recent  
years. Research studies have increasingly found that health information
exchange interventions  
can effectuate positive outcomes in health care quality and public
health outcomes, in addition to  

-----

<span id="207"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**207**  
more longstanding findings around reductions in utilization and costs.
Electronic patient event  
notifications from hospitals, or clinical event notifications, are one
type of health information  
exchange intervention that has been increasingly recognized as an
effective and scalable tool for  
improving care coordination across settings, especially for patients at
discharge. This approach  
has been identified with a reduction in readmissions following
implementation.[75](CMSs.html#207)  
These notifications are automated, electronic communications from the
provider to  
another facility or another community provider identified by the
patient. These automated  
communications alert the receiving provider that the patient has
received care at a different  
setting. Information included with these notifications can range from
simply conveying the  
patient’s name, basic demographic information, and the sending
institution, to a richer set of  
clinical data depending upon the level of technical implementation.
However, regardless of the  
information included these alerts can help ensure that a receiving
provider is aware that the  
patient has received care elsewhere. The notification triggers a
receiving provider to reach out to  
the patient to deliver appropriate follow-up care in a timely manner. By
providing timely  
notifications, the alert may improve post-discharge transitions and
reduce the likelihood of  
complications resulting from inadequate follow-up care.  
Virtually all EHR systems generate the basic messages commonly used to
support  
electronic patient event notifications. We believe that care
coordination can have a significant  
positive impact on the quality of life, consumer experience, and health
outcomes for patients.  
However, we acknowledge that though such activities can have positive
impact, they will likely  
generate some costs. We believe it is difficult to quantify the impact
of this proposed change  
because EHR implementation across care settings varies in maturity
rates, leading to potential

variance in cost and impact across such settings. We believe that this
proposal would impose  
minimal additional costs on hospitals. The cost of implementing these
proposed changes would  
largely be limited to the one-time cost related initial implementation
of the notification system,  
and to the revision of a policies and procedures as they relate to
discharge planning. There also  
may be some minimal cost associated with communicating these changes to
affected staff.  
However, we believe that these costs would be offset by the benefits
derived from positive  
outcomes in health care quality and public health outcomes. Therefore,
while this proposal  
would impose a minimal burden on hospitals, we believe that, in sum, the
changes proposed  
would greatly benefit patients overall.  
4\. Effects of Other Proposed Policy Changes  
In addition to those proposed policy changes discussed previously that
we are able to  
model, we are proposing to make various other changes in this proposed
rule. Generally, we have  
limited or no specific data available with which to estimate the impacts
of these proposed  
changes. Our estimates of the likely impacts associated with these other
proposed changes are  
discussed in this section.  
a. Care Coordination Across Payers  
In section V. of this proposed rule, we are proposing a new requirement
for MA plans,  
Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and QHP issuers
in FFEs to require  
these plans to maintain a process to exchange, at a minimum, the USCDI
data set upon an  
enrollee’s request. Under our proposal, each of these plans subject to
the requirement would,  
upon an enrollee’s request: (1) accept the data set from another plan
that had covered the  
enrollee within the previous 5 years; (2) send the data set at any time
during an enrollee’s  
enrollment and up to 5 years later, to another plan that currently
covers the enrollee; and (3) send  

-----

<span id="209"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**209**  
the data set at any time during enrollment or up to 5 years after
enrollment has ended to a  
recipient identified by the enrollee.  
Such transactions would be made in compliance with applicable laws.  
We believe that sending and receiving this minimum data would help both
plan enrollees  
and health care providers in coordinating care and reducing
administrative burden. We believe  
that this entails utilizing all tools available to us to ensure that
plans provide coordinated high-  
quality care in an efficient and cost-effective way that protects
program integrity.  
We believe that this proposal would impose minimal additional costs on
plans. We note  
that we do not specify a transport standard in the proposal and
anticipate that plans may opt to  
use APIs, such as the API that this proposed rule would also require. We
also anticipate that  
plans may choose to utilize a regional health information exchange. We
believe it is difficult to  
quantify the impact of this proposed change because plans will likely
implement different  
transport methods, and we cannot predict the selected method plans will
choose.  
b. Care Coordination Through Trusted Exchange Networks  
In section VI. of this proposed rule, we are proposing to require MA
plans, Medicaid  
managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities and QHP issuers in FFEs
to participate in trust  
networks in order to improve interoperability in these programs. We
believe that payers and  
patients’ ability to communicate between themselves and with health care
providers could  
considerably improve patient access to data, reduce provider burden, and
reduce redundant and  
unnecessary procedures. A trusted exchange framework allows for the
secure exchange of  
electronic health information with, and use of electronic health
information from, other health IT  
without special effort on the part of the user. Widespread payer
participation in such a  
framework might also allow for more complete access, exchange, and use
of all electronically  
accessible health information for authorized use under applicable state
or federal law. Under our  

-----

<span id="210"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**210**  
proposal, participation would be required in a trusted exchange
framework that meets the  
following criteria:  
● The trusted exchange network must be able to exchange PHI, defined in
45 CFR  
160.103, in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws across
jurisdictions.  
● The trusted exchange network must connect both inpatient EHRs and
ambulatory  
EHRs.  
● The trusted exchange network must support secure messaging or
electronic querying  
by and between patients, providers and payers.  
We believe that this proposal would impose minimal additional costs on
plans.  
D. Alternatives Considered  
This proposed rule contains a range of proposed and potential future
policies. It provides  
descriptions of the statutory provisions that are addressed, identifies
the proposed policies, and  
presents rationales for our decisions and, where relevant, alternatives
that were considered. We  
carefully considered the alternatives to this proposed rule but
concluded that none would  
adequately and immediately begin to address the critical issue of the
lack of patient access and  
interoperability, or exchange of health care data within the health care
system.  
The critical policy decision was how broadly or narrowly to classify the
standards  
required to implement interoperability. Overly prescriptive standards
may stifle innovation and,  
in turn, increase costs. On the other side, broad language surrounding
standards risked leaving  
too much open to interpretation and continuing the uncertainty about
which standards would be  
the most practical and cost-effective to implement. We determined it was
most appropriate to  
propose a technical and standards framework that strikes a balance
between these two ends of the  
spectrum, and to establish that we expect the standards framework to
expand and mature as  
interoperability increases.  

-----

<span id="211"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**211**  
A second decision was how broadly or narrowly to apply the proposed
policies and  
requirements. For example, alternatives to requiring health plans to
provide claims data to  
patients via an open API could have been altered in a number of ways,
such as requiring more or  
less information to be provided to patients or, simultaneously, to
require additional information  
beyond that already accessible through existing APIs be provided to
patients by providers.  
Ultimately, we opted to continue to consider most matters pertaining to
providers in separate  
RFIs, such as that in the FY 2019 IPPS proposed rule seeking information
about program  
participation conditions and requirements, and to maintain the policies
proposed in this rule as  
policies that will further enhance and secure the foundation of future
interoperability, including  
through inclusion of payers, through care coordination, and through
matters of security and  
identity confirmation.  
As we recognize that advancing interoperability is no small or simple
matter, we continue  
to explore alternatives and potential other policies. We have requested
comment for  
consideration in future rulemaking or subregulatory guidance on a number
of alternatives related  
to whether additional policies or requirements, beyond those proposed
herein, should be imposed  
to promote interoperability. For example, the Innovation Center is
seeking comment on general  
principles around promoting interoperability within Innovation Center
models for integration  
into new models as part of the design and testing of innovative payment
and service delivery  
models. Additionally, we are seeking comment on how we may leverage our
program authority  
to provide support to those working on improving patient matching. For
example, we are  
requesting comment on whether CMS should require, in Medicare FFS, the
MA program,  
Medicaid FFS, CHIP FFS, Medicaid managed care programs, CHIP managed
care entities, and  
the FFEs, use of a particular patient matching software solution with a
proven success rate of a  
certain percentage validated by HHS or a 3rd party. We also continue to
consider feedback

received from RFIs issued in various rules over the course of the past
year and to incorporate  
those suggestions into our strategy.

The preceding discussion was an actual cost impact (not a transfer)
since goods and  
computer services are being paid for. Plans have the option of
transferring their expenses to  
enrollees. In practice, because of market competitive forces a plan may
decide to operate at a  
(partial) loss and not transfer the entire cost. It is important to
estimate the maximum the transfer  
could be. Some costs are transferred to the States (for Medicaid and
CHIP) and ultimately to the  
federal government (for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP), mitigating the
amount transferred to

**213**  
enrollees. One approach to estimate impact on enrollees was made in
section XVI.B. of this RIA.  
However, this analysis did not take into account transfers.  
We now re-estimate the potential full transfer. As noted in section
Tables 4 through 8 of  
XVI.B. of this RIA, we have in 2021 through 2024 under a dollar increase
in premium as the  
worst case scenario, and we used actual costs per year. In this
alternate analysis we use actual  
amounts for each of 2021 through 2024 with the initial 1-year cost
amortized over 5 years. In  
other words, we assume a cost of $110 (275.4/5 + 54.7)  
We point out that this premium increase should be counterbalanced by
projected savings  
arising from the provisions in this proposed rule. More specifically, we
expect the availability of  
portable electronic transfer of medical data proposed by this rule to
increase prevention of future  
medical illnesses due to better data accessibility. The savings from
avoiding one illness or one  
cheaper procedure would offset the under one-dollar impact. However, we
have no way, at this  
point, of estimating this aspect of the future savings of the rule.  
We present two estimates. First, we estimate using the enrollment
figures used in Table 7  
of this RIA. Table 7 shows that we have 169 million (76+73+20) in
programs that will be  
spending about $110 million per year. Ignoring Federal subsidies, and
assuming that all costs  
will be passed on to enrollees (which is contrary to our experience),
the 169 million enrollees  
would each incur an extra 65 cents (110/169) a year to achieve the $110
million goal. We next  
estimate using premium versus enrollment as was done in section XVI.B.
of this RIA.  
Prior to discussing potential transfers to enrollees, we discuss how
this proposed rule may  
affect commercial enrollees not in the MA, Medicaid, CHIP, or FFE
programs. Technically,  
plans are only required to provide interoperability for enrollees in the
MA, Medicaid, CHIP, and  
FFE programs. However, it is both possible and likely, that a Parent
Organization providing  
interoperability for its FFE and other program enrollees as required,
may choose to offer this to  

-----

<span id="214"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**214**  
commercial enrollees. Consequently, it is possible that to cover the
cost of offering  
interoperability to commercial enrollees outside the MA, Medicaid, CHIP
and FFE programs, the  
Parent Organizations, raise premiums to both their commercial enrollees
as well as the MA,  
Medicaid, CHIP or FFE enrollees. Thus it is possible (and we argue
likely) that this proposed  
rule will affect commercial enrollees even though there is no
requirement to provide them  
interoperability. Therefore, we believe we are obligated in this RIA to
calculate the cost impact  
per enrollee should the Parent Organizations offer interoperability (and
should they pass on the  
cost of interoperability in terms of commercial premium). The rest of
the discussion below  
explores this possibility.[76](CMSs.html#214)  
Commercial**:** Rebates are required under section 2718(b)(1)(A) of the
PHSA and the  
implementing regulations at 45 CFR part 158 when an issuer does not meet
the applicable  
threshold. The commercial market MLR is generally calculated as the
percent of each dollar of  
after-tax premium revenue spent by the issuer on medical products and
services, and activities  
that improve the quality of health care. If the issuer MLR for a state
market is below the  
applicable threshold, then the issuer must return the difference to
policyholders. It follows, that if  
interoperability costs raise plan costs, and if additionally, the
issuers pass on the full cost in the  
form of premium and/or are able to treat these costs as QIAs, then
premiums and rebates will  
  
76 Note that our analysis in Tables 5,6,7,8 also assume that costs are
incurred by commercial enrollees even though  
there is no requirement to provide them with interoperability. We
believe this the most likely scenario. However, if  
we are restrictive in our impact analysis and only assume MA, Medicaid,
CHIP and FFE enrollees are bearing the  
cost the results of Tables 5-8 would not change the negligibility
conclusion as the following justifications show: We  
have assumed 20 million, 73 million and 76 million enrollees in the MA,
Medicaid and Commercial programs  
(Table 7). The 20 million and 73 million remain accurate. The 76 million
(commercial enrollees) must be replaced  
by FFE enrollees. For this purpose we use QHP data. Based on internal
data (some of which has not yet been  
published), for 2017 there were 9,757,747 enrollees with $55,109,210,072
total premium resulting in a $5600 per  
enrollee per year cost, and for 2018, there were 9,925,382 enrollees
with $70,738,585,845 total premium resulting in  
a $7100 per enrollee per year cost. To illustrate how this changes the
Table 7 impact, the $2.10 per enrollee per year  
cost for 2020 commercial must be replaced by $15.96 to account for a
division by 10 million versus 76 million.  
Although this is a big increase, $15.96 is still only about one third a
percent of the per-enrollee-per-year costs of the  
FFE. Thus the cost is still negligible. Furthermore, a Parent
Organization actuary reviewing these numbers would  
probably seriously recommend that all enrollees including commercial be
offered the interoperability since that  
significantly reduces the per enrollee per year cost.

change. The following two highly simplified examples are illustrative.  
Suppose the MLR threshold is 85 percent (in practice it can vary by
state market), but the  
issuer’s MLR is below the threshold at 75 percent. Then the issuer would
have to return the 10  
percent as a rebate. If the interoperability costs for an issuer are on
average 6 percent of  
premium and the issuer treats these expenses as QIA, the issuer will now
have to rebate only 4  
percent instead of 10 percent (that is, the issuer’s MLR would be 81
percent rather than 75  
percent). Similarly, if both the applicable threshold and issuer MLR are
85 percent, then the  
issuer would not owe a rebate.  
There are two effects of recognizing these costs as QIA: (1) for issuers
below the  
applicable MLR threshold, the rebate from issuers to policyholders would
go down by some  
amount between $0 and the interoperability cost; and (2) for issuers at
or above the MLR  
standards, the premium transfers from enrollees to issuers will go up by
some amount between  
$0 and the interoperability cost.  
To estimate these amounts, we used the public use 2016 MLR files on the
CMS website  
that were used for Tables 4 through 7 of this RIA. The total 2016
premium revenue on the  
commercial side was approximately $370 billion. Of the $370 billion, the
total 2016 premium  
revenue of issuers that were below the commercial MLR standard (80 or 85
percent, depending  
on the market) was approximately $19.4 billion and that subset of
issuers paid a total of $455  
million in rebates.  
As mentioned earlier, to proceed further we use the estimates of the
interoperability costs  
which are $110 million per year. This cost is for all parent
organizations with each parent  
organization possibly dealing with up to four lines of business subject
to MLR requirements:  
MA (including Part D sponsors); Medicaid; CHIP; and Commercial. Thus, of
the $110 million  
level annual cost of interoperability, we estimate $64 million (57.81
percent commercial  

-----

<span id="216"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****

****  
**216**  
proportion x $110 million level annual interoperability cost) to be the
cost for the commercial  
market.  
In estimating the transfers to policyholders in the commercial market,
we must distinguish  
between the $19.4 billion of premium revenues of issuers whose MLR was
below the applicable  
threshold and the $350.6 billion of premium revenues ($370 billion total
revenue – $19.4 billion)  
of issuers whose MLR was at or above the applicable threshold. We can
now calculate the  
estimated aggregate transfer in the commercial market from the
policyholders to the issuers  
whether through premium or rebates as follows:  
● Interoperability cost = 0.017 percent of revenue premium ($64 million
cost / $370  
billion total revenue).  
● Reduced MLR rebates = $3.3 million (0.017 percent x $19.4 billion
premium from  
issuers below the applicable MLR threshold).  
● Increased premiums = Up to $60.0 million (0.017 percent x ($370
billion total revenue  
– $19.4 billion premium from issuers below the applicable MLR
threshold)).  
● Total transfer from enrollees = Up to $63.3 million ($60.0 million
increased  
premium+$3.3 million reduced rebate).  
● Transfer per enrollee = 83 cents ($63.3 million / 76 million
commercial enrollee).  
We note that the 83 cents (under a dollar per enrollee) is consistent
with the results  
obtained in Tables 4 through 8 (with exact raw amounts by year without
amortization of a large  
first year expense). These calculations are summarized in Tables 10-1
through 10-5.

F. Regulatory Reform Analysis under EO 13771  
Executive Order 13771, titled Reducing Regulation and Controlling
Regulatory Costs,  
was issued on January 30, 2017 and requires that the costs associated
with significant new  
regulations “shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the
elimination of existing costs  
associated with at least two prior regulations.” This proposed rule is
considered an EO 13771  
regulatory action. We estimate that this rule generates $56.7 million in
annualized costs,  
discounted at 7 percent relative to year 2016, over an infinite time
horizon. Details on the  
estimated costs of this proposed rule can be found in the preceding
analysis.  
G. Conclusion  
The analysis above, together with the preceding preamble, provides an
RIA.  
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this
regulation was  
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

(a) *Application Programming Interface to support enrollees*. Subject to
paragraph (h) of  
this section, QHP issuers in a Federally-facilitated Exchange, not
including stand-alone dental  
plans (SADP) issuers, must implement and maintain an open Application
Programming Interface  
(API) that permits third-party applications to retrieve, with the
approval and at the direction of an  
individual enrollee, data specified in paragraph (b) of this section
through the use of common  
technologies and without special effort from the enrollee.  
*(b) Accessible content.* (1) A QHP issuer in a Federally-facilitated
Exchange must make  
the following information accessible to its enrollees through the API
described in paragraph (a)  
of this section:  
(i) Standardized data concerning adjudicated claims, including claims
data for payment  
decisions that may be appealed, were appealed, or are in the process of
appeal, and provider  
remittances and enrollee cost-sharing pertaining to such claims, no

****  
****  
**246**  
(iii) Clinical data, including laboratory results, if the QHP issuer
maintains such data, no  
later than one (1) business day after data is received by the issuer.  
(c) ** *Technical requirements.* A QHP issuer in a Federally-facilitated
Exchange:  
(1) Must implement, maintain, and use API technology conformant with the
API  
technical standards adopted by the Secretary at 45 CFR 170.215;  
(2) Must conduct routine testing and monitoring to ensure the API
functions properly,  
including assessments to verify the API is fully and successfully
implementing privacy and  
security features such as, but not limited to, those minimally required
to comply with HIPAA  
privacy and security requirements in 45 CFR part 164, 42 CFR parts 2 and
3, and other  
applicable law protecting privacy and security of individually
identifiable data;  
(3) Must use the following content and vocabulary standards for data
available through  
the API where applicable to the data type or data element, unless
alternate standards are required  
by other applicable law:  
  
(i) Content and vocabulary standards adopted by the Secretary at 45 CFR
170.213 where  
such are the only available standards for the data type or element;  
(ii) Content and vocabulary standards adopted by the Secretary at 45 CFR
part 162 and  
42 CFR 423.160 where required by law, or where such standards are the
only available standards  
for the data type or element; or  
(iii) The content and vocabulary standards in either paragraph (c)(3)(i)
or (ii) of this  
section as determined appropriate for the data type or element, where a
specific data type or  
element may be encoded or formatted using content and vocabulary
standards in either paragraph  
(c)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.  
(4) May use an updated version of any standard or all standards required
under  
paragraphs (c)(1) or (3) of this section, where:  

-----

<span id="247"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**247**  
(i) Use of the updated version of the standard is required by other
applicable law, or  
(ii) Use of the updated version of the standard is not prohibited under
other applicable  
law, provided that:  
(A) For content and vocabulary standards other than those adopted at 45
CFR 170.213,  
the Secretary has not prohibited use of the updated version of a
standard for purposes of this  
section or 45 CFR part 170;  
(B) For standards adopted at 45 CFR 170.213 and 45 CFR 170.215, the
National  
Coordinator has approved the updated version for use in the ONC Health
IT Certification  
Program; and  
(iii) Where use of the updated version of a standard does not disrupt an
end user’s ability  
to access the data described in paragraph (b) of this section through
the API described in  
paragraph (a) of this section.  
(d) *Documentation requirements for APIs.* For each API implemented in
accordance with  
paragraph (a) of this section, a QHP issuer must make publicly
accessible, by posting directly on  
its website and/or via publicly accessible hyperlink(s), complete
accompanying documentation  
that contains, at a minimum:  
(1) API syntax, function names, required and optional parameters
supported and their  
data types, return variables and their types/structures, exceptions and
exception handling  
methods and their returns;  
(2) The software components and configurations an application must use
in order to  
successfully interact with the API and process its response(s); and  
(3) All applicable technical requirements and attributes necessary for
an application to be  
registered with any authorization server(s) deployed in conjunction with
the API.

<span id="248"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**248**  
(e) *Denial or discontinuation of access to the API.* A QHP issuer in a
Federally-  
facilitated Exchange may deny or discontinue any third party
application’s connection to the API  
required under paragraph (a) of this section if the issuer:  
(1) Reasonably determines that allowing an application to connect or
remain connected to  
the API would present an unacceptable level of risk to the security of
personally identifiable  
information, including protected health information, on the QHP issuer’s
systems; and  
(2) Makes this determination using objective, verifiable criteria that
are applied fairly and  
consistently across all applications and developers through which
enrollees seek to access their  
electronic health information as defined at 45 CFR 171.102, including
but not limited to criteria  
that may rely on automated monitoring and risk mitigation tools.  
(f) *Exchange of data between plans.* (1) Subject to paragraph (d) of
this section, QHP  
issuers in a Federally-facilitated Exchange, not including SADP issuers,
must maintain a process  
for the electronic exchange of, at a minimum, the data classes and
elements included in the  
content standard adopted at 45 CFR 170.213 of this subchapter.
Information received by a QHP  
issuer must be incorporated into the QHP issuer’s records about the
enrollee. At the request of  
an enrollee, a QHP issuer must:  
(i) Accept such data from any other health care plan that has provided
coverage to the  
enrollee within the preceding 5 years;  
(ii) At any time the enrollee is currently enrolled in the plan and up
to 5 years after  
disenrollment, send such data to any other health care plan that
currently covers the enrollee; and  
(iii) At any time the enrollee is currently enrolled in the plan and up
to 5 years after  
disenrollment, send such data to a recipient designated by the
enrollee.  
(2) QHP issuers must participate in a trusted exchange network which:  

-----

<span id="249"></span>**CMS-9115-P**  
****  
****  
****  
**249**  
(i) Is capable of exchanging protected health information, defined at 45
CFR 160.103 of  
this subchapter, in compliance with all applicable State and Federal
laws of relevant  
jurisdictions;  
(ii) Is capable of connecting to inpatient electronic health records and
ambulatory  
electronic health records; and  
(iii) Supports secure messaging or electronic querying by and between
providers, payers  
and patients.  
(g) *Enrollee resources regarding privacy and security.* A QHP issuer in
a Federally-  
facilitated Exchange must provide on its website and through other
appropriate mechanisms  
through which it ordinarily communicates with current and former
enrollees seeking to access  
their health information held by the QHP issuer, educational resources
in non-technical, simple  
and easy-to-understand language explaining at a minimum:  
(1) General information on steps the individual may consider taking to
help protect the  
privacy and security of their health information, including factors to
consider in selecting an  
application, and understanding the security and privacy practices of any
application to which  
they will entrust their health information; and  
(2) An overview of which types of organizations or individuals are and
are not likely to  
be HIPAA covered entities, the oversight responsibilities of OCR and
FTC, and how to submit a  
complaint to:  
(i) The HHS Office for Civil Rights; and  
(ii) The Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  
(h) *Exception*. (1) If a plan applying for QHP certification to be
offered through a  
Federally-facilitated Exchange believes it cannot satisfy the
requirements in paragraphs (a), (b),  
or (c) of this section, the issuer must include as part of its QHP
application a narrative  

-----

<span id="250"></span>**CMS-9115-P**

****  
**250**  
justification describing the reasons why the plan cannot reasonably
satisfy the requirements for  
the applicable plan year, the impact of non-compliance upon enrollees,
the current or proposed  
means of providing health information to enrollees, and solutions and a
timeline to achieve  
compliance with the requirements of this section.  
(2) The Federally-facilitated Exchange may grant an exception to the
requirements in  
paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) if the Exchange determines that making such
health plan available  
through such Exchange is in the interests of qualified individuals and
qualified employers in the  
State or States in which such Exchange operates.  
(i) *Applicability*. This section is applicable for plan years beginning
on or after January 1,  
2020\.  
(ii) \[Reserved\]
